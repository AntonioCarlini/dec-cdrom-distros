           DESCRIPTION

           VMS/Hangul V5.5 is the Korean (Hangul) version of the standard VMS V5.5.
           VMS/Hangul extends the standard VMS to provide an operating system en-
           vironment to support Hangul and ASCII on VAX and Micro/VAX series com-
           puters. On top of the basic functions of VMS, VMS/Hangul extends and
           enhances the system utilities and environment to process Hangul data.

           terchange of the Republic of Korea.

           This SPD describes only the Hangul specific features of VMS/Hangul which
           are extensions or additions to standard VMS. For a description of the
           base functionality and supported environment of VMS, please refer to
           the standard VMS V5.5 SPD (SPD 25.01.xx).

           features such as Hangul word manipulation and line drawing capabil-
           ities are available.

           KOREAN SCREEN MANAGEMENT FACILITY (SMG)

           Korean SMG provides a set of run-time library routines to perform ter-
           minal independent functions on supported Korean terminals. Both Hangul
           and Hanja are supported in Korean SMG.

           TERMINAL FALLBACK FACILITY

           The Terminal Fallback Facility (TFF) is extended to support charac-
           ter conversions on Hangul terminals which can only display the DOOSAN
           Character Set (DOOSAN 2-byte code). It allows these Hangul terminals
           to input and output Hangul characters (Hanja is not supported) in the
           KS C 5601-1987 Character Set by converting characters going to and from
           the terminal. The character conversion is performed through a char-
           acter table transparent to application software.

           HANGUL PROCESSING RUN-TIME LIBRARY

           VMS/Hangul provides a Multi-byte Processing Run-Time Library for pro-
           gram and application development involving Hangul processing. The Run-
           Time Library routines perform a variety of Hangul processing functions
           such as string manipulation, read/write operations, character conver-
           sion and other Hangul processing operations. These routines can be called
           from programs written in the VAX programming languages listed below.
