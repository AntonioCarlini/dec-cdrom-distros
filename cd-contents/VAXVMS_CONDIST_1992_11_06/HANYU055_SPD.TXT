           PRODUCT NAME: VMS/Hanyu Operating Sytem, Version 5.5    SPD 25.G7.10


           DESCRIPTION

           VMS/Hanyu V5.5 is the Chinese (Hanyu) version of the standard VMS 
           V5.5. VMS/Hanyu extends the standard VMS to provide an operating 
           system environment to support Chinese and ASCII characters on VAX 
           and Micro/VAX series computers. On top of the basic functions of 
           VMS, VMS/Hanyu extends and enhances the system utilites and 
           environment to process Chinese data.

           VMS/Hanyu supports Chinese data representation that conforms to the
           National Bureau of Standards CNS11643, the Standard Interchange Code
           for Generally-used Chinese Characters (SICGCC, 1986) of Taiwan. The
           EDPC Recommanded Character Set defined by Electronic Data Processing
           Center of Executive Yuan of Taiwan is also supported as a standard
           option.

           This SPD describes only the Chinese specific features of VMS/Hanyu 
           which are extensions or additions to standard VMS. For a description
           of the base functionality and supported environment of VMS, please
           refer to the standard VMS V5.5 SPD (SPD 25.01.xx).

           PRODUCT NAME: VMS/Hanyu Operating System, Version 5.5    SPD 25.G7.10


           -  2-byte Chinese character deletion and cursor movement

           -  2-byte Chinese character wrapping

           -  Pattern matching including 2-byte Chinese characters

           HEVE is the Chinese extended version of the Extensible VAX Editor 
           (EVE) running on HTPU providing a general-purpose Chinese screen 
           editor to process Chinese and ASCII characters. Extended commands 
           which include features such as Chinese word manipulation and line  
           drawing capabilities are available. 

           PHRASE INPUT UTILITY

           The Phrase Input Utility facilitates creation and maintenance of 
           user-defined database for frequently used phrases and input 
           sequences for those phrases. Input of these phrases can then be done
           using the defined input sequence on supported terminals which 
           provide this facility.


           TERMINAL FALLBACK FACILITY

           The Terminal Fallback Facility (TFF) is extended to support charac-
           ter conversions on MITAC terminals which can only display the TELEX
           CODE Character Set(2 bytes). It allows these MITAC TELEX CODE termi-
           nals to input and output Chinese characters in the SICGCC (1986) 
           Character Set by converting characters going to and from the 
           terminal. This character conversion is performed through a character
           table transparent to application software.


           CHINESE PROCESSING RUN-TIME LIBRARY

           VMS/Hanyu provides a Multi-byte Processing Run-Time Library for pro-
           gram and application development involving Chinese processing. The 
           Run-Time Library routines perform a variety of Chinese processing 
           functions such as string manipulation, read/write operations, 
           character conversion and other Chinese processing operations. These 
           routines can be called from programs written in the VAX programming
           languages listed below.


           CHINESE SCREEN MANAGEMENT FACILITY (SMG)

           Chinese SMG provides a set of run-time library routines to perform
           terminal independent functions on supported Chinese terminals. 
           Output of 1/2/4 byte characters can be handled by calling these 
           routines. Only 1/2 byte characters input are handled in this version.
