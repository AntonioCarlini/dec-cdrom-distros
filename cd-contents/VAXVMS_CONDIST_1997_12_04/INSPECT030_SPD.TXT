PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER Security Compliance Manager  SPD 26.N1.05
               for OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha, Ver-
               sion 3.0

DESCRIPTION

POLYCENTER[TM] Security Compliance Manager for OpenVMS[TM] (POLYCEN-
TER Security CM) is a software tool that a security or system manager
uses to establish a custom security analysis and reporting system to
manage the security of a network of distributed systems. With this tool,
the security manager can implement and maintain a security standard
consistent with corporate security policy for the OpenVMS nodes in the
distributed computing environment.

FEATURES

Centralised Security Management

POLYCENTER Security CM Version 3.0 represents a major redesign of the
product.

Note: To use POLYCENTER Security CM Version 3.0, you must be running
OpenVMS Version 6.1 or 6.2. If you are running OpenVMS VAX Version 5.0-
Version 6.0 or OpenVMS Alpha Version 1.5, then you must use POLYCEN-
TER Security CM Version 2.3.

POLYCENTER Security CM now includes client-server capabilities for the
central management of security on multiple OpenVMS nodes and clusters.
To avail of this central management, you must also purchase and in-
stall the POLYCENTER Security Console product on a PC in your network.
Digital recommends that you use POLYCENTER Security Console to man-
age POLYCENTER Security CM.

                                                      November 1995

Customers can purchase security consulting services for assistance in
designing and implementing a security analysis and reporting system
that balances business needs with security requirements. Local Dig-
ital[TM] offices can assist customers in determining the appropriate
services for their requirements.

Many Test Categories

POLYCENTER Security CM provides tests to examine the following cat-
egories of system settings:

o  Accounts

o  Auditing

o  Files

o  Network

o  Passwords

o  SYSGEN

In addition, users can create their own tests and integrate them with
POLYCENTER Security CM tests.

Version 3.0 includes the following improved test capability:

o  Tests to check for the presence or absence of a specified string
   in the prelogin message banner and in the postlogin message ban-
   ner displayed by the operating system.

o  Additional SYSGEN parameters are supported.

o  All auditing parameters are supported.

o  There is no longer a limit on the number of user-defined test col-
   lections that a system manager can include in an inspector.

Account Templates
 

POLYCENTER Security CM now allows the user to create account templates
which can be used to group accounts according to a user's required test
criteria. Users can group accounts that share similar characteristics
or they can choose to list accounts by name. Users can then apply tests
to groups of accounts. For example, it is possible to use a template
to specify to the system which accounts are to be considered privi-
leged accounts and then to test all privileged accounts for account
activity. The POLYCENTER Security Console graphical user interface (GUI)
is used to create account templates.

Exclusion Lists

In Version 3.0 it is possible to use the POLYCENTER Security Console
GUI to specify files, accounts, and account templates to exclude from
some of the tests.

Inspectors

POLYCENTER Security CM stores tests in entities called inspectors. In-
spectors arrange tests hierarchically into subsystems and test col-
lections. The system settings that POLYCENTER Security CM tests are
defined as test values for the test collections within the inspector.
System managers can use POLYCENTER Security Console to easily create
and distribute inspectors to nodes and clusters running POLYCENTER Se-
curity CM.

Reports

POLYCENTER Security CM mails reports, summarizing the results of an
inspection, to a distribution list specified for each inspector. Re-
ports coded in HTML for ease of navigation, can be viewed from the POLY-
CENTER Security Console GUI. You can also view reports from the Open-
VMS node.

Correcting Security Violations

POLYCENTER Security CM generates lockdown command procedures that can
be used to automatically reset parameters that do not comply with the
requirements of the inspector. Users can view and run the command pro-
cedures using the POLYCENTER Security Console GUI or the POLYCENTER

                                 3

 

Security CM command line interface (CLI). Version 3.0 also allows users
to specify that POLYCENTER Security CM is to automatically run the lock-
down procedure.

POLYCENTER Security CM also generates unlockdown command procedures
that can be used to reverse the operation of the corresponding lock-
down file. POLYCENTER Security CM generates a corresponding unlock-
down command procedure every time it generates a lockdown command pro-
cedure.

Tokens

POLYCENTER Security CM can now generate a token after executing any
inspector. Tokens contain summaries of the inspection results. POLY-
CENTER Security CM transmits these tokens to a POLYCENTER Security Re-
porting Facility for OpenVMS node using either DECnet[TM] or TCP/IP.
Data being transferred is scrambled and is never sent as clear text
across the network. POLYCENTER SRF extracts the data from the tokens
and stores it in a relational database. POLYCENTER SRF supports cen-
tralized management for distributed POLYCENTER Security CM client nodes.
Designated users can access this information to monitor the security
compliance of all the nodes in a network.

For more information about managing network security, see the POLY-
CENTER Security Reporting Facility for OpenVMS Software Product De-
scription (SPD 26.N2.xx).
