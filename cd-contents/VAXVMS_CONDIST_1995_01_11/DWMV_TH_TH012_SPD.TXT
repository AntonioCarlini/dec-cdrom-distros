startup time.  This locale switching mechanism is also designed to be 
interoperable with other DECwindows Motif products, such as DEC OSF/1 and
ULTRIX Worksystem Software.

provide internationalization functionali ties such as locale-encoded string
supports and input methods.  Some of the X11R5 internationalization features 
can be invoked via the OSF/Motif R1.2 toolkit, such as input methods with
different interaction styles.
