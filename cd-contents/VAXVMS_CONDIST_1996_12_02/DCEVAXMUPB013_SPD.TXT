           PRODUCT NAME:  Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) Version 1.3 
	   SPD 43.05.04   for OpenVMS
       

           DESCRIPTION

           The Distributed Computing Environment for OpenVMS product family pro-
           vides a set of the distributed computing functionality specified for
           the Open Software Foundation[TM]'s (OSF[R]) Distributed Computing En-
           vironment (DCE) as well as tools for application developers. With DCE,
           the OSF has established a standard set of services and interfaces that
           facilitate the creation, use, and maintenance of client-server appli-
           cations. The DCE for OpenVMS serves as the basis for an open comput-
           ing environment where networks of multivendor systems appear as a sin-
           gle system to the user. Since DCE makes the underlying networks and
           operating systems transparent, application developers can easily build
           portable, interoperable client-server applications. Users can locate
           and share information safely and easily across the entire enterprise.
           The DCE for OpenVMS supplies system managers with a set of tools to
           consistently manage the entire distributed computing environment, while
           also assuring the integrity of the enterprise. The DCE for OpenVMS prod-
           uct family supports both the OpenVMS[TM] VAX[TM] and OpenVMS[TM] Al-
           pha Operating Systems.

           The functionality provided in the DCE for OpenVMS product family in-
           cludes:

           o  DCE Remote Procedure Call (RPC): Used to create and run client-server
              applications, the RPC allows direct calls to remote systems as if
              they were local procedure calls.

           o  DCE Distributed Time Service (DTS): Synchronizes time on individ-
              ual nodes in a distributed network environment.

           o  DCE Security Service: Provides secure communications and access via
              authorization and authentication services.

                                         DIGITAL                  October 1995

                                                                   AE-PSYVD-TE

 



           Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) Version 1.3   SPD 43.05.04

           o  DCE Cell Directory Service (CDS): Provides location-independent nam-
              ing for resources.

           o  Global Directory Agent (GDA): The Global Directory Agent provides
              a means of linking multiple CDS namespaces via either X.500 or the
              Internet Domain[R] Name Server (BIND).

           o  The Interface Definition Language (IDL) compiler: IDL is the lan-
              guage used to define remote procedure calls.

           o  Tools and utilities that help manage the DCE environment.

           The DCE Threads Service which provides user-context multiprocessing
           functionality is provided as part of the OpenVMS Operating System.

           The DCE for OpenVMS product family currently consists of eight sep-
           arate products, four on OpenVMS VAX, and four on OpenVMS Alpha, to pro-
           vide customers with maximum flexibility for configuring a DCE envi-
           ronment, known as a DCE cell. The products are:

           o  DCE Runtime Services for OpenVMS, which is required for all sys-
              tems participating in the DCE cell. The DCE Runtime Services kit
              includes DCE client functions as well as DCE administration tools.

           o  DCE Application Developers' Kit for OpenVMS, which is required for
              developers of distributed applications, but optional for other users.
              The DCE Application Developers' Kit provides programmers with all
              the DCE API's and the Interface Definition Language (IDL). IDL is
              an easy-to-use, ANSI C-based language for writing remote procedure
              calls.

           o  DCE Cell Directory Server, at least one of which is required for
              each DCE cell. The DCE CDS Server is a central repository contain-
              ing information about the location of resources in the DCE cell.
              It allows access to resources by a single name, regardless of phys-
              ical location.

           o  DCE Security Server, at least one of which is required for each DCE
              cell. The DCE Security Server protects resources from illegal ac-
              cess and provides secure communications within and between DCE cells.

           Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) Version 1.3   SPD 43.05.04
           for OpenVMS

           The DCE for OpenVMS V1.3 product family is an implementation of OSF
           DCE V1.0.3 adapted and enhanced for OpenVMS. Enhancements include:

           o  DCE for OpenVMS provides simplified installation and configuration.

           o  Integrated Login. This settable feature enables DCE login to oc-
              cur automatically when a user logs in to a standard interactive ses-
              sion. At the OpenVMS username and password prompts, the user en-
              ters either his OpenVMS username and password or his DCE account
              name and password. If valid, the user is logged in to both the Open-
              VMS system and the DCE cell in a single integrated operation.

           o  IMPORT and EXPORT utilities to move accounts to and from the DCE
              Registry and OpenVMS's SYSUAF.

           o  The DCE IDL compiler for OpenVMS supports DEC C++, and FORTRAN, as
              well as C.

           o  The DCE IDL has been extended to support a number of C++ language
              syntax features that provide a distributed object framework. The
              DCE RPC runtime environment now supports DEC C++ bindings to re-
              mote objects.

           o  IDL development templates are provided to help with the develop-
              ment of client-server interfaces.

           o  A conversion utility for DEC RPC V1.0 programs[1].

           o  A PC name server proxy agent, a feature which enables systems run-
              ning Microsoft[R] RPC to obtain CDS bindings.

           The DCE for OpenVMS also includes two utilities that complement the
           DCE core services, NSedit, and The Resource Broker.

           o  NSedit. NSedit is a Motif based graphical tool which enables users
              to navigate, manipulate, and peruse the CDS name space much more
              effectively and efficiently than when using the CDS command line
              interface.

           ____________________

         [1] DEC RPC conversion utility is available on VAX only.

           for OpenVMS

           o  The Resource Broker. The Resource Broker is a graphical utility that
              dynamically provides you with the location of the best resource or
              service available across the network, based on user-defined cri-
              teria. The Resource Broker allows you to optimize the resources within
              your distributed environment by not only finding all instances that
              satisfy your application's resource needs, but also by providing
              you with a list of those instances sorted in the order that best
              satisfies your application needs. The Resource Broker may also be
              used to monitor the state of DCE services across the network.


           PRODUCT OPTIONS

           The DCE for OpenVMS product family currently consists of eight sep-
           arate products, four on OpenVMS VAX, and four on OpenVMS Alpha:

           1. DCE Runtime Services Kit for OpenVMS VAX
           2. DCE Runtime Services Kit for OpenVMS Alpha

           This is a fully integrated set of services that provide applications
           with the essential capabilities required to use DCE's distributed ser-
           vices. The DCE Runtime Services makes the following DCE features avail-
           able to distributed applications:

           o  Remote Procedure Call Runtime API and Library that includes:

           o  PC proxy agent for communication with Microsoft[R] RPC

           o  The Resource Broker

           A group of DCE systems that work together and are administered as a
           unit is called a cell. Every system within a DCE cell must run the DCE
           Runtime Services kit.

           RPC supports the client-server model that characterizes many distributed
           applications. The DCE Runtime Services kit provides such client-server
           applications the ability to interoperate over DECnet, TCP/IP and UDP
           /IP network protocols on the OpenVMS operating system. See the sec-
           tion titled SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS for additional details.

           The right-to-use the DCE Runtime Services for OpenVMS is included as
           part of the OpenVMS Operating System license. See the section titled
           SOFTWARE LICENSING for more detailed information.

           3. DCE Application Developers' Kit for OpenVMS VAX
           4. DCE Application Developers' Kit for OpenVMS Alpha

           The DCE Application Developers' Kit for OpenVMS includes tools required
           for the development of distributed applications using remote proce-
           dure calls (RPC). It includes:

           o  IDL RPC stub compiler

           o  Time provider source code routines

           o  Sample applications

           o  All public DCE application programming interfaces

           o  IDL development templates

           o  UUIDGEN

           Support for the X Directory Service (XDS) API and Generic Security Ser-
           vice API (GSSAPI) is also included in the DCE Application Developers'
           Kit.

           The DCE Runtime Services for OpenVMS is a prerequisite for use of the
           DCE Application Developers' Kit and must be installed first.

           for OpenVMS

           5. DCE Cell Directory Server for OpenVMS VAX
           6. DCE Cell Directory Server for OpenVMS Alpha

           The DCE Cell Directory Server provides a consistent mechanism for nam-
           ing and locating users, applications, files, and systems within a DCE
           cell. The DCE CDS Server also includes the Global Directory Agent (GDA).
           The Global Directory Agent provides a means of linking multiple CDS
           namespaces via the Internet Domain[R] Name Server (BIND).

           The DCE Runtime Services kit is required on each system in the cell.
           Users must install the Runtime Services Kit before installing the DCE
           CDS Server. Similarly, the DCE CDS Server requires the installation
           of the DCE Security Server on a system in the same DCE cell.

           7. DCE Security Server for OpenVMS VAX
           8. DCE Security Server for OpenVMS Alpha

           The DCE Security Server allows users controlled access to information
           in a distributed computing environment safely and confidentially. The
           DCE Security Server accomplishes this through three services:

           o  DCE Authentication Service allows users and resources to prove their
              identity to each other. The DCE Authentication Service is based on
              Kerberos, which requires that all users and resources possess a se-
              cret key.

           o  DCE Authorization Service verifies operations that users may per-
              form on resources. A DCE Registry Service contains a list of valid
              users. An Access Control List (ACL) associated with each resource
              determines valid users, through the Registry Service, and the types
              of operations a user may perform.

           o  DCE Data Integrity Service protects network data from tampering.
              Cryptographic checksums automatically generated by RPC enable DCE
              to determine whether data has been modified or corrupted in trans-
              mission.

           The DCE Runtime Services kit is required on each system in the cell.
           Users must install the Runtime Services Kit before installing the DCE
           Security Server. Similarly, the DCE Security Server requires the in-
           stallation of the DCE CDS Server on a system in the same DCE cell.


           OSF CERTIFICATION

           Digital certifies that the DCE for OpenVMS conforms to the OSF[R] Ap-
           plication Environment Specification/Distributed Computing (AES/DC),

           Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) Version 1.3   SPD 43.05.04
           for OpenVMS

           The CDS Server and Security Server images are automatically installed
           as part of the DCE Runtime Services but must be enabled by Product Au-
           thorization Keys (PAKS).

           These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
           sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
           system environment, configuration, and software options.

           CLUSTER ENVIRONMENT

           This layered product is fully supported when installed on any valid
           and licensed VAXcluster* configuration without restrictions.

           *  VAXcluster configurations are fully described in the VAXcluster Soft-
              ware Product Description (29.78.xx) and include SEE, Ethernet, and
              Mixed Interconnect configurations.

           SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

           OpenVMS Operating System V5.5-2, V6.0, V6.1 (VAX) or V1.5, V6.1 (Al-
           pha).

           TCP/IP is required to establish a DCE cell. DECnet may also be used
           in conjunction with TCP/IP for application communication, but TCP/IP
           is required for communication between DCE cell members by DCE services.
           DECnet only environments are only supported for applications using just
           the RPC, and are not configuring their environment into a DCE cell.

           The DCE for OpenVMS supports Digital's TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS.
           It is also designed to work with other vendors TCP(UDP)/IP products.
           Contact your TCP vendor to see if it supports the DCE for OpenVMS.

           The DCE for OpenVMS will communicate over DECnet Phase IV or over DEC-
           net/OSI (also known as DECnet Phase V).
