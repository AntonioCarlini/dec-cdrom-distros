 PRODUCT NAME:   Digital Device Access Software for Siemens 3964 V3.0
 SPD 60.47.01

 DESCRIPTION

 The Digital Device Access Software (DAS) for Siemens 3964 allows both
 BASEstar Open users and DEComni applications to access Siemens 3964
 devices using the 3964[R] or 3964[R]_RK512 protocol.

 The DAS also allows a Digital system to emulate one or more Siemens
 3964 devices. In this way, a Digital system can fulfill requests com-
 ing from 3964 remote devices.

 BASEstar Open Data Services provide device independent access to shop
 floor data allowing users to access data on a Siemens 3964 device sim-
 ply by getting and putting the value of one or more Device_Data_Points.
 A request to locally emulated devices can generate an unsolicited event.

 DEComni API applications can perform a variety of device access func-
 tions through the DEComni MMS-oriented Application Programming Inter-
 face (API).

 Using BASEstar Open Data Services or the DEComni API, users or appli-
 cations can:

 o  Exchange data messages with Siemens devices (3964[R] protocols).

 o  Perfom direct or named access to Siemens devices memory blocks (3964[R]_
    RK512 protocols).

 The DAS supports only point-to-point RS232 connections.

                                                           July 1996
