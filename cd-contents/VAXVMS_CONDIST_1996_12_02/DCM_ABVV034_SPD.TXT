 solicited data collection.

 Using the BASEstar Classic DAS for Allen-Bradley Data Highway Proto-
 col, users or applications can perform a variety of device access func-
 tions for the Allen-Bradley family of PLCs. Examples of functions sup-
 ported for the Allen-Bradley PLCs include: reading and writing data,
 uploading and downloading logic programs, and reading the status of
 a device. The BASEstar Classic DAS for Allen-Bradley Data Highway Pro-
 tocol also supports structured data, which allows structures to be im-
