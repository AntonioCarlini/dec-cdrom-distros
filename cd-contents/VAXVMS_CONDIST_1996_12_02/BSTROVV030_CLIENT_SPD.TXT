 PRODUCT NAME:   BASEstar Open Client                   SPD 62.54.01
                  Version 3.0

 DESCRIPTION

 BASEstar Open is an industrial automation integration platform that
 facilitates the integration of manufacturing applications and plant
 equipment. Accelerated development of integrated manufacturing sys-
 tems is assured through an architecture that also encourages consis-
 tency of application development.

 BASEstar Open takes advantage of the client/server computing archi-
 tecture. BASEstar Open Servers provide the robust, high-availability
 environment required by mission-critical applications. BASEstar Open
 Clients, on the other hand, provide access to all BASEstar Open ser-
 vices and BASEstar Open-managed information from any network Node on
 which BASEstar Open Client is installed. Client and server communi-
 cations within BASEstar Open are provided through TCP/IP network com-
 munications.

 For a description of the BASEstar Open Server product, refer to SPD
 47.87.xx.

 The BASEstar Open Client allows applications to have transparent ac-
 cess to BASEstar Open objects regardless of their physical location
 in the distributed BASEstar Open environment. The Application Program-
 ming Interface provided allows applications to:

 o  Define, reference, and access Data_Point objects

 o  Define, reference, notify, subscribe, and receive event objects

 o  Define, reference, and exchange Packet data objects

 Features

 The following features are those that a BASEstar Open Client can re-
 quest from a BASEstar Open Server via BASEstar Open's API:

 Application Integration

 o  Data Management

    BASEstar Open Data Services provide a standard mechanism for defin-
    ing, organizing, and accessing data in a distributed manufactur-
    ing environment from a variety of sources including plant devices
    and area, plant, and work cell applications.

    BASEstar Open defines discrete data elements (Data_Points) to con-
    tain manufacturing information. Data_Point definitions can be of
    various types, ranging from scalar data elements to user-defined
    data structures. This provides the high flexibility of data def-
    inition and acquisition required to define the many different types
    of data typically present in industrial plants.

    Since each Data_Point is referenced by name, applications become
    independent of their data sources and, consequently, do not require
    alteration as data sources change. In addition, simple Data_Points
    can have a predefined value specified at startup time. The value
    of a Data_Point may also be derived from the value of another Data_
    Point. The derived value can be obtained directly or modified by
    an arithmetic/logical expression. Data Services allow applications
    to define and manage Data_Points.

    Each Data_Point can be associated with one or more Triggers. A Trig-
    ger defines a relationship between a Data_Point, a Filter, and an
    Event. Each time the value of a triggered Data_Point changes, as-
    sociated Filter expressions are evaluated. Whenever the Boolean re-
    sult of an evaluated Filter expression is TRUE, the associated Event
    is declared.

    One or more versions of a Data_Point value can be stored. In ad-
    dition to the value, each Data_Point version includes the time when
    the Data_Point value changed and its status at that time.

                                  2

 

    A new version is generated each time the value of a Data_Point changes.
    A user can request the current version, and thus the current value,
    or alternatively, the value associated with any cached version.

 o  Event Services

    BASEstar Open Event Services allow users to subscribe to one or more
    Events. Events are occurrences that are of interest to an appli-
    cation program-like threshold exceeding, alarms, job completion,
    and so on. Users define the occurrence of such Events and specify
    the context information that should be passed. This context infor-
    mation can also include data and their types.

    To be notified of the occurrence of a specific Event, an applica-
    tion must issue a subscription to the Event.

    When an Event is declared, Event Services create and deliver the
    notifications that can be received by subscribers. A single Event
    declaration can generate many notifications on a one-to-many re-
    lationship, depending on the number of active subscriptions.

 o  Packet Services

    BASEstar Open Packet Services allow users to directly exchange Pack-
    ets of information. Two users can establish direct communication
    through a Port; one user connects to send a Packet, and the other
    user connects to receive it.

    A Packet contains a description of information that must be exchanged.
    Each Packet input and output parameter is described by a datatype.

    BASEstar Open delivers a Packet to a Port in a protocol-independent
    manner and also independent of the location of the users and Ports
    involved.

 o  Graphic Configuration Utility (GCU)

    BASEstar Open offers a PC-based Graphic Configuration utility util-
    ity with an MS Windows "look and feel". It allows users to:

    o  Manage BASEstar Open objects using create, delete and modify com-
       mands

    o  Load existing configurations from CLI scripts and snapshots

                                  3

 

    o  Save configurations in CLI scripts and snapshots.

    o  Browse through BASEstar Open configurations

 The Graphic Configuration utility is bundled with BASEstar Open Server
 kits on Windows NT systems. It is included with the BASEstar Open Client
 on MS Windows and Windows NT systems.

 BASEstar Open users on UNIX or OpenVMS platforms can take advantage
 of the Graphic Configuration utility via the PC-based BASEstar Open
 Client and GCU product. The PC-based Graphic Configuration utility re-
 places the Motif-based GCU previously available with BASEstar Open Ver-
 sion 2.0.
