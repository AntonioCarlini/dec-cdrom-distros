           PRODUCT NAME:    DECosap/AP Version 3.0                SPD 47.96.02
                           (Digital's Omni Services for SINEC Au-
                           tomation Protocols/SINEC AP Services)

           DESCRIPTION

           DECosap/AP is a network communication product. It provides a solution
           to connect Digital applications with shop floor devices based on 
           Siemens[R] SINEC[R] Automation Protocol (AP) communication protocol.
           Although mainly oriented to the manufacturing environment, SINEC AP 
           addresses generic applications and is intended to provide a common 
           communication method between different Siemens automation devices 
           Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), numeric control machines, 
           robots, personal computers and minicomputers.

           Siemens SINEC AP is layered on top of the SINEC H1 network and pro-
           vides proprietary Session, Presentation, and Application layers. The
           result offers an integrated Siemens Level 1 solution with an associ-
           ated value of a consistent and uniform view to the plant floor appli-
           cations.

           DECosap/AP fully supports the SINEC AP communication protocol.

           Features

           DECosap/AP provides the support for SINEC AP Application, Presenta-
           tion, and Session layers. As this communication protocol is defined
           on top of the ISO OSI Transport Layer, DECosap/AP relies upon DECnet
           /OSI to complete the communication stack. For more information, re-
           fer to the DECnet/OSI Software Product Description (SPD 41.92.xx)

                                                                     July 1996

                                                                   AE-PZAUB-TE

           (Digital's Omni Services for SINEC Automation Protocols/SINEC AP Ser-
           vices)

           Because of the functional compatibility between Siemens SINEC AP and
           MMS (Manufacturing Messaging Services), ISO International Standard 
           9506, Parts 1 and 2, DECosap is integrated with the software 
           architecture of the DEComni API product to supply the Application 
           Programming Interface (API). For more information, refer to the 
           DEComni API Software Product Description (SPD 47.88.xx).

           Components

           o  DECosap/AP Services

           This component adds support for SINEC AP functionality under the 
           DEComni API. Supported services are listed at the end of this 
           Software Product Description and are divided into the following 
           categories:

                 Environmental Management, VMD Support, Variable Access, Serial
                 Transfer, Program Invocation, and Domain Services.

           o  Configuration and Management Facilities
               DECosap/AP uses the DEComni API facility ODSCL.

           On OpenVMS platforms, the following DEComni API facilities are sup-
           ported:

              -  ODF (Omni Definition Facility)

              -  OmniView

           o  Support for the Device Access Services of BASEstar Open

           o  Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)

           The DECosap IVP performs a series of tests to verify proper instal-
           lation.

           Documentation

           DECosap/AP includes the following documentation:

           o  A platform-specific Network Manager's and Programmer's Guide that
              provides an overview of SINEC H1 (see the DECosap/AP Software 
              Product Description-SPD 47.95.02) and SINEC AP concepts and 
              terminology. It includes a description of the services that are 
              available through DEComni API and features of DECosap. It also 
              describes the use of the DEComni API utility ODSCL.

           o  A platform-specific Installation Guide that explains how to pre-
              pare for installation, how to install the product, and what to do
              after DECosap is installed.

           INSTALLATION
