 PRODUCT NAME:  Digital Device Access Software for Modicon, Version 3.0
 SPD 55.51.02

 DESCRIPTION

 The Digital Device Access Software (DAS) for Modicon allows users to
 access Modicon Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) through BASEs-
 tar Open Device Services, BASEstar Open Data Services or DEComni Ser-
 vices.

 Via BASEstar Open Device Services the user may configure device and
 variable definitions, read and write variable values, and configure
 for polled data collection and information reports.

 BASEstar Open Data Services provide device independent access to shop
 floor data allowing the user to configure data points, read and write
 data point values and generate events based on data changes.

 Users can also perform a variety of device access functions for Mod-
 icon PLCs using the Modicon DAS by interfacing directly to DEComni APIs.

 The Digital DAS for Modicon supports the following Modicon PLCs:

 o  Modicon Micro 84

 o  Modicon 184, 384, 484, 584M, 584L, 884

 o  Modicon 984 family of devices

 The Modbus protocol is supported on both Digital UNIX on Alpha and Open-
 VMS VAX platforms, while Modbus Plus support is limited to the Open-
 VMS platforms.
