PRODUCT NAME:  ObjectBroker for OpenVMS, Version 2.6   SPD 44.12.03

DESCRIPTION

ObjectBroker for OpenVMS (VAX and Alpha) Version 2.6 provides appli-
cation developers and system integrators with the development tools
and run-time environments to integrate applications and services dis-
tributed across UNIX[R] environments (Digital UNIX [TM]), SunOS[TM],
Solaris[TM], HP-UX[R], IBM[R] AIX[R]), Microsoft[R], Windows 95[R],
Windows[TM], Macintosh[R], and Windows NT[TM] (Alpha and Intel[TM]).

ObjectBroker Version 2.6 is Digital's implementation of the Object Man-
agement Group's (OMG[R]) Common Object Request Broker Architecture 
(CORBA[TM]) specification V1.2 and V2.0 for enterprise wide production 
use. ObjectBroker also extends Microsoft OLE technology to a multiplatform
distributed computing environment.

ObjectBroker simplifies distributed application development by pro-
viding platform-independent, client/server, programming interfaces.
It offers an object-oriented (O-O) approach to dynamic linking of in-
dependently developed applications and services. ObjectBroker allows
application processes to transparently invoke, control, and interact
with each other across multiple platforms.

Features

o  A high-level, standards-based application programming interface (API)
   across 20 platforms. Support for Windows 95 is added in ObjectBro-
   ker Version 2.6.

o  Compliance with OMG's CORBA specification, protecting users' soft-
   ware development investments.

o  New C++ language bindings provide C++ programmers a natural inter-
   face as defined in CORBA Specification Version 2.0. C programming
   language and Visual Basic bindings continue to be supported.

o  Integration with Kerberos/DCE Security for optional integration of
   secure client and server applications on Windows NT and Digital UNIX.

o  OLE Integration (known as the OLE Portal) and DDE Integration (known
   as the DDE Listener) provide the ability for shrink-wrapped and cus-
   tom desktop applications, that comply with the Microsoft OLE and
   DDE interfaces, to communicate with certain remote ObjectBroker servers.
   Developers can use the OLE Portal and DDE Listener features today
   to begin moving toward open client/server environments.

o  Script servers allow client access to existing applications using
   command line interfaces, with no source changes necessary, facil-
   itating the migration to client/server computing.

o  O-O abstraction provides insulation of clients and servers from changes
   in network topology or application code through the use of implementation-
   independent brokering services.

o  ObjectBroker Version 2.6 provides new tools (QuickStart) to make
   it easier for new users to get an application up and running, as
   well as making experienced users more productive.

o  ObjectBroker Version 2.6 provides a new Server Management API to
   enable system managers to manage servers through a callable API.

ObjectBroker for OpenVMS, Version 2.6 Capabilities

ObjectBroker V2.6 is a software product that enables client and server
applications, on different computer systems, to communicate over a net-
work. Each message between the client and server is called a request
and the process of sending a request is called invocation.

Client Application

The client application sends a request, possibly over a network, for
an operation to be performed. The request is performed by an imple-
mentation within a server application.

Server Application

The server application contains implementations that satisfy client
requests when they are received. The server application returns in-
formation back to the client application.

ORB

The Object Request Broker (ORB) provides functions specific to the client
and to the server. A client request first goes to the ORB, which is
the primary mechanism that ObjectBroker uses to locate ObjectBroker
implementations on the network.

The server-side ORB answers requests from clients and dispatches them
to the appropriate server application.

Agent

The agent is the entity provided as part of ObjectBroker V2.6 that per-
forms services on behalf of a user in the context of ObjectBroker. An
agent must be present on any computer that supports applications that
provide services using ObjectBroker. The agent maintains a list of ac-
tive servers on the computer and can automatically start new servers
if needed to respond to client requests.

Repository

                                 3

 

The ObjectBroker repository contains definitions of ObjectBroker in-
terfaces and their associated implementations. An ObjectBroker inter-
face is the set of operations and attributes that can be performed on
a object. An implementation contains the code that satisfies a client
request for operations on a specific object.

The interface repository also contains method maps, which describe the
criteria by which to select implementations. The interface definitions
in the Interface Repository are written in OMG IDL, which is described
in the CORBA specification and in the ObjectBroker documentation.

Context Object

A context object contains information about a user's preferences, which
are taken into account during the resolution process, and additional
properties and values which are propagated to the server side during
an invocation request. In addition, applications can store profile in-
formation in the context object that is not used as resolution cri-
teria.

Script Server

The script server is a special ObjectBroker server process which al-
lows legacy applications to be encapsulated as object implementations.
The script server allows applications that export a command line in-
terface to be used as object implementations. Client applications have
no knowledge that an object's implementation is actually implemented
as a script.

Registry

The ObjectBroker registry stores information outside of user appli-
cations, that is used by all of the components of ObjectBroker.

The configuration partition of the registry contains information about
the configuration of ObjectBroker on a given computer, including the
list of available transports and the authentication package to be used.



                                 4

 

The security partition of the registry contains information about a
user's authorization to access specific implementations and methods.
Along with authorization information for users, the security registry
also contains information that describes the list of remote users that
are allowed to access ObjectBroker on the current computer

The advertisement partition of the registry stores information about
servers, where to find them, and what they provide.

The implementation partition of the registry contains information about
object implementations that have been installed on the computer. At
a minimum, the implementation registry contains the unique identifier
of the implementation, the operating system specific command for start-
ing the server process that contains the implementation code, and the
list of attributes to be defined as environment variables when the pro-
cess that executes the implementation is started.

Developer's Features

The ObjectBroker product contains many functions to aid in program de-
velopment. There are utilities to generate code for the client and server
applications, utilities to define and manage security and environmen-
tal settings, and utilities to support other products and their in-
terface to ObjectBroker.

For code generation, ObjectBroker utilizes a language to describe the
interfaces of your distributed application. ObjectBroker utilities use
this language to generate code and other definitions used at run-time.

Developer's features include the following:

o  OMG Interface Definition Language (IDL) for describing classes and
   messages

o  Support for User Defined Types (UDT)

o  Generation of client-side stubs for operations defined on one or
   more interfaces:

   -  Static interfaces use code skeletons (stubs) containing routines
      that cannot be changed. Stubs provide a linear interface and re-
      duce the complexity of the method resolution.

                                 5

 

   -  Dynamic interfaces use routines that the client defines and builds
      as it is running. The dynamic interface provides client with more
      flexibility to use deferred synchronous operations, different
      method maps, and new interfaces.

o  Generation of OMG IDL skeletons (dispatchers), registration rou-
   tines, and method routine stubs for servers

o  Support for the Dynamic Invocation Interface (DII) routines

Additionally, ObjectBroker provides utilities to manage the security
settings and the overall environment. These utility functions are avail-
able as command-line functions as well as through graphical user in-
terface utilities (GUIs).

Digital Extensions to the CORBA specification provide enhanced
capabilities. These extensions include:

Languages

o  The Implementation Language (IML) describes methods and their im-
   plementations.

o  The Method Mapping Language (MML) maps operations to the methods
   that implement them.

QuickStart is a new code generation facility. It is a prototyping tool
that allows a user to take an OMG IDL file and generate code for the
client, server, methods, make files and more. QuickStart reduces the
complexity and time to create a running ObjectBroker client/server ap-
plication and is particularly useful for evaluators to test their IDL
and showcase ORB functionality.

Improved System Management makes it possible for a system manager to
monitor the state of server applications within a distributed produc-
tion environment through a callable API. This facilitates integration
with other management tools or products.



                                 6

 

ObjectBroker Graphical User Interface Utilities provide a fully sup-
ported, windowed set of utilities that help system integrators man-
age the CORBA environment and programmers develop new distributed ap-
plications. The utilities provide interfaces that:

o  View and manipulate context objects, repositories, and remote servers

o  Generate code for programmers

o  Set up the environment (security, proxies, transport)

The user interface of each utility is based on CORBA concepts. The util-
ity's interface is native to the platform on which it is executing (Mo-
tif[R], Windows, Macintosh).

OLE and DDE

ObjectBroker Version 2.6 works cooperatively with Microsoft's Object
Linking and Embedding (OLE) to provide a network "portal" from Microsoft
Windows platforms to ObjectBroker server platforms. ObjectBroker ap-
plications on UNIX and OpenVMS systems can be made OLE-aware (by im-
plementing a set of pre-defined OLE methods shipped with ObjectBro-
ker) and will respond to requests from OLE applications on Microsoft
Windows.

The ObjectBroker OLE Portal processes OLE API calls on Window Systems
and maps them to messages. These messages are then sent to an appro-
priate ObjectBroker server on the network for resolution. From a user's
perspective, the mapping process is transparent. Within an OLE appli-
cation, the OLE Portal appears as another local OLE server applica-
tion, which can be expanded to a window to display OLE-aware appli-
cations/servers on the network. Information from sources across the
network can be linked or embedded into desktop applications through
ObjectBroker. The ObjectBroker OLE portal employs OLE Version 2.0 in-
terfaces and also provides support for OLE Version 1.0 applications.

ObjectBroker extends the Microsoft Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) com-
munication protocol to allow Microsoft Windows applications on a net-
worked PC to interact using DDE with applications running on, Solaris,

                                 7

 

SunOS, IBM AIX, HP-UX, OpenVMS and Digital UNIX. Applications can func-
tion as DDE clients or servers. DDE support in ObjectBroker allows two
Microsoft applications to communicate on different PCs.

Transports

ObjectBroker supports PATHWORKS TCP/IP, Novell[R] TCP/IP and PATHWORKS
DECnet IV network transports. In addition, ObjectBroker uses the Winsocket
Version 1.1.1 interface to PATHWORKS TCP/IP and Novell TCP/IP and may
work with other WinSock-compliant TCP/IP transports implementations.
However, no others have been tested nor are they supported at this time.

Multiple Simultaneous Transports

ObjectBroker V2.6 supports multiple network transports on a single sys-
tem; each transport can run concurrently. A client running TCP/IP and
DECnet can communicate with a server that is running either TCP/IP,
DECnet, or both. The system administrator controls which transports
are available to client and server applications on each system. The
platforms that support multiple simultaneous transports are OpenVMS
(VAX and Alpha), Macintosh, Microsoft Windows and Windows NT (Intel
and Alpha).

Network Tester

The network tester utility provides the ability to determine whether
the network is properly configured for use with ObjectBroker. A user
can specify the amount of data to be sent between a network tester client
and server. This tool also provides detailed error messages when fail-
ures occur. The user can test ObjectBroker and the network between two
computers without having to write an ObjectBroker test program.
