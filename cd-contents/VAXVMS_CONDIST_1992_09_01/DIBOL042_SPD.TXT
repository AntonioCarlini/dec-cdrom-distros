           PRODUCT NAME:  VAX DIBOL, Version 4.2        SPD 25.49.15

           DESCRIPTION

           VAX DIBOL is a high-level procedural language designed specif-
           ically for interactive business data processing. It runs un-
           der the VMS Operating System, taking full advantage of the
           system facilities.

           VAX DIBOL is a superset of the DIBOL-83 definition. VAX DIBOL
           is highly compatible with DIBOL implementation on other op-
           erating systems including CTS-300 and RSTS/E.

           VAX DIBOL includes support for several tools and utilities
           on VMS including the VAX Language-Sensitive Editor, VAX De-
           bugger, and the VAX Performance Coverage Analyzer.

           VAX DIBOL also includes support for the 1988 ANSI DIBOL Stan-
           dard, X3.165-1988.

           VAX DIBOL provides efficient terminal handling and efficient
           access to the VAX Record Management Services (RMS). RMS pro-
           vides access to sequential, relative and indexed file or-
           ganizations. The .INCLUDE directive allows access to com-
           mon record definitions stored in VAX CDD/Plus. Other facil-
           ities such as VAX DATATRIEVE, VAX DBMS, VAX FMS, DECforms
           and VMS Run-Time Library routines are available as exter-
           nal subroutine calls.

           VAX DIBOL supports a set of language statements commonly re-
           ferred to as structured constructs. These statements are de-
           signed to complement and facilitate desirable programming
           practices.

           VAX DIBOL, Version 4.2                      SPD 25.49.15


           The DIBOL compiler reads a source program and produces a share-
           able object module. The compiler is capable of producing a
           source listing with embedded diagnostics and a cross ref-
           erence listing. Object modules produced by the compiler con-
           form to the VAX Procedure Calling Standard and may be linked
           with native mode object modules produced by other VAX lan-
           guage processors.

           VAX DIBOL includes a compiler, a run-time library, exter-
           nal subroutine libraries, a message manager for communicat-
           ing between programs, a program to monitor the activities
           of the message manager, and programs that provide access to
           VAX SORT using command files that are compatible with other
           DIBOL products.

           VAX DIBOL also includes a menu facility, support for long
           file names (up to 39 characters in the ``name'' portion of
           the filespec) and an ISMCRE subroutine which allows creation
           of RMS indexed files under DIBOL program control.

           The VAX DIBOL compiler generates debug records for use with
           the VAX Symbolic Debugger, including support for source line
           debugging.

           DIBOL Language Description

           A DIBOL program is separated into two major parts:

           o  Data Division - Defines the data used by the program

           o  Procedure Division - Contains the executable statements

           The first element in most DIBOL statements is an English lan-
           guage verb that characterizes the action to be performed.
           The other elements of the statement are data names, refer-
           ences to statement labels, and/or expressions. DIBOL state-
           ments fall into the following categories:

           o  Compiler Directives - Provide information about the pro-
              gram to the compiler

           o  Compiler Declarations - Provide information about the pro-
              gram structure to the compiler

           o  Data Specification Statements - Define the data used in
              the program. DIBOL supports the following VAX architec-
              ture data types:

                  Byte             (I1)

                  Word             (12)

                  Longword         (I4)

                  Quadword         (I8)

                  Octaword         (I16)

                  Character        (A)
                  string

                  Zoned trailing   (D)
                  numeric

                  Packed decimal   (P)

              Full arithmetic support is included for all data types
              except Octaword and Character String.

           o  Data Manipulation Statements - Perform conversions and
              value assignments

           o  Control Statements - Modify the order of statement ex-
              ecution

           o  Intertask Communications Statements - Allow communica-
              tion between programs

           o  Input/Output Statements - Move data between memory and
              I/O devices

           Universal External Subroutine Library

           The Universal External Subroutine Library contains the ex-
           ternal subroutines available and performs similar functions
           on all DIBOL implementations.

           The Operating System-Specific Library contains the exter-
           nal subroutines available and performs similar functions on
           one or more of the DIBOL implementations. With VAX DIBOL,
           the library includes routines to perform functions such as
           position the file pointer within a file, mounting/dismounting
           disk and tape units, and locking the program into memory.

           Run-Time Subroutine Library

           The Run-Time Subrouting Library contains the external sub-
           routines available only with VAX DIBOL and provides func-
           tions unique to VAX. The library includes routines to per-
           form functions such as handling mailboxes, converting data
           from one type to another, and returning device/file infor-
           mation.
