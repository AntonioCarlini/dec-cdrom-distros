           PRODUCT NAME:  VAX ACMS, Version 3.2         SPD 25.50.10
                          (Application Control and Man-
                          agement System)

           DESCRIPTION

           VAX ACMS is a transaction processing (TP) monitor designed
           for the VMS Operating System. VAX ACMS works with other Dig-
           ital Equipment Corporation commercial application software
           products to provide users with a complete and customizable
           development and run-time environment for transaction pro-
           cessing applications such as order tracking, accounting and
           billing, shop floor control, and insurance claims process-
           ing.

           VAX ACMS software helps users through the entire applica-
           tion development life cycle, including the installation, plan-
           ning, design, development, testing, implementation, manage-
           ment, and maintenance of complex TP applications. VAX ACMS
           provides a special-purpose application definition language
           for structured definition of TP application functions and
           run-time characteristics.

           VAX ACMS makes efficient use of the VMS Operating System and
           associated hardware resources, making VAX ACMS particularly
           suited to mission-critical applications that require high
           throughput and performance.

           VAX ACMS provides integration with the following Digital lay-
           ered products:

           o  DECforms or VAX TDMS for forms management

           o  VAX CDD/Plus for the creation, analysis, and administra-
              tion of metadata

           (Application Control and Management System)

           o  VAX Rdb/VMS, VAX DBMS, and VMS RMS for data management

           o  DECtrace for VMS for performance event data collection

           o  DECtp Desktop for ACMS for multi-vendor client access to
              ACMS applications

           o  All VAX languages and tools for application development

           Because VAX ACMS is designed to allow for modular implemen-
           tation as well as development, users can separate and dis-
           tribute front-end processing (data input/output operations
           such as forms processing) from back-end processing (data cal-
           culations and database storage). In addition, VAX ACMS al-
           lows users the use of non-standard terminal or I/O devices
           (such as bar-code readers and ATMs).

           VAX ACMS, Version 3.2                       SPD 25.50.10
           (Application Control and Management System)

           VAX ACMS uses a high-level, English-like definition language
           that replaces system service calls for most TP application
           functions. Using the VAX ACMS Application Definition Util-
           ity, a programmer can:

           o  Structure all application work into three basic steps:

              -  Exchange steps for terminal I/O processing

              -  Processing steps for database access and general com-
                 putation

              -  Block steps for performing work common to several pro-
                 cessing and exchange steps

           o  Control task execution and flow using conditional state-
              ments such as IF THEN ... ELSE, WHILE DO, SELECT FIRST,
              and CONTROL FIELD syntax in conjunction with Boolean ex-
              pressions

           o  Define and implement subroutine transactions using the
              CALL TASK syntax

           o  Create menus and hierarchies of menus

           o  Define resources used to execute transactions, such as
              servers, workspaces and audit trails

           o  Start and end database RECOVERY units

           VAX ACMS also includes the ACMS Task Debugger to debug VAX ACMS
           definitions and servers.

           Run-time System

           VAX ACMS includes a complete run-time system for implement-
           ing application definitions. The VAX ACMS Run-time System
           is made up of eight specialized processes (four manage the
           processing of a transaction, and four monitor and control
           the run-time system).

           VAX ACMS, Version 3.2                       SPD 25.50.10
           (Application Control and Management System)

           The following VAX ACMS processes manage the work within ACMS
           transactions:

           o  Command Process (CP) - Manages logins and interaction be-
              tween terminals and VAX ACMS. CPs can be multi-threaded
              (one CP process can handle menuing and forms I/O for many
              VAX ACMS terminals simultaneously). The CP passes input
              data to the Application Execution Controller (EXC) for
              processing by a server.

           o  Application Execution Controller (EXC) - Controls task
              execution for all the tasks in an application. Each ap-
              plication has its own EXC process, which starts up and
              controls the server processes needed to handle process-
              ing work for tasks.

           o  Server Process (SP) - Carries out the high-level program-
              ming language routines or DCL routines that handle a task's
              processing work and database or file I/O. Programmers link
              their routines to the VAX ACMS-supplied main program to
              create customized servers for database access, computa-
              tion and other functions.

           o  Queued Task Initiator (QTI) - Removes task elements from
              a task queue and initiates their execution in a speci-
              fied application. Queued tasks are tasks placed in a queue
              for later execution. Queued tasks cannot collect input
              data, but otherwise are the same as any other VAX ACMS
              task.

           The VAX ACMS processes that monitor and control the run-time
           system are:

           o  VAX ACMS Application Central Controller (ACC) - Acts as
              the central control point for VAX ACMS run-time systems.
              The ACC starts and controls the Terminal Subsystem Con-
              troller, the QTI, the EXC, and the audit trail log. The
              ACC process must be started and running on each computer
              system where VAX ACMS applications are used.

           (Application Control and Management System)

           o  Audit Trail Log (ATL) - Writes information about a run-
              ning VAX ACMS system to the audit trail log file. The ATL
              keeps a record of when the VAX ACMS system starts and stops,
              when users log in, and when applications and tasks start
              and stop.

           o  Terminal Subsystem Controller (TSC) - Creates and con-
              trols the number of active Command Processes (CPs) and
              assigns terminals to CPs. The TSC starts and stops CPs
              as needed, and controls which terminals can access VAX ACMS.

           o  Software Event Logger (SWL) - Records all ACMS internal
              software errors and event messages that occur during the
              execution of VAX ACMS application programs.

           Communications among these run-time processes can occur on
           a single computer system or between more than one computer
           in a VAXcluster system or DECnet network. For example, a Com-
           mand Process (CP) on one computer system can initiate a task
           within an application on another computer system.

           Application Management and Control

           Once an application is developed, the user moves that ap-
           plication into a production (real-use) environment. VAX ACMS
           provides support for VAX ACMS applications used in a pro-
           duction environment.

           VAX ACMS includes seven utilities for defining, monitoring
           and modifying application management characteristics:

           o  VAX ACMSGEN - Modifies and displays VAX ACMS system pa-
              rameters.

           o  Application Authorization Utility (AAU) - Authorizes ap-
              plications to be installed.

           o  User Definition Utility (UDU) - Authorizes users to log
              in to VAX ACMS and assigns login displays, including de-
              fault menus, to VAX ACMS users.

           (Application Control and Management System)

           o  Device Definition Utility (DDU) - Authorizes VAX ACMS ter-
              minals and, optionally, defines captive terminals to log
              in directly to VAX ACMS.

           o  Queue Manager (QUEMGR) - Creates and manages VAX ACMS task
              queues and queued task elements.

           o  Software Event Log Utility Program (SWLUP) - Creates re-
              ports of selected events recorded by the Software Event
              Logger.

           o  Audit Trail Report Utility (ATR) - Returns records of ap-
              plication and user activity.

           In addition to the utilities, VAX ACMS also provides users
           with the following additional support for application man-
           agement and control:

           o  VAX ACMS Operator Commands - Perform standard operator
              functions such as starting and stopping the VAX ACMS sys-
              tem, the TSC (Terminal Subsystem Controller) process, the
              QTI process and ACMS applications

           o  Command Procedures - Evaluate and modify the values of
              VMS and VAX ACMS system parameters, and VAX ACMS run-time
              process quotas

           Front-End/Back-End Processing (Client/Server Processing)

           In VAX ACMS, terminal, menu, and other I/O functions are sep-
           arated from database or file processing and computational
           functions. The terminal and menu functions are handled on
           the front-end of the transaction processing system, while
           task flow control, data processing, and computations are per-
           formed on the back-end of the system.

           The separation of functions in VAX ACMS (called the client
           /server model) can be implemented on a single node or on mul-
           tiple nodes in a DECnet network. Because the VAX ACMS client
           /server model always provides separate front and back ends,

                                       6

 



           VAX ACMS, Version 3.2                       SPD 25.50.10
           (Application Control and Management System)

           users can at any time off-load the front-end to another com-
           puter system without reprogramming the application code.

           The VAX ACMS Systems Interface (SI) lets users write front-
           end programs, or agents, to support specialized devices such
           as bar-code readers and automatic teller machines.

           VAX ACMS includes support for failover in a distributed en-
           vironment. If one VAX processor is not available to process
           a transaction, VAX ACMS can automatically route the trans-
           action to another application running on an available pro-
           cessor.

           Presentation Services

           Users select and run VAX ACMS tasks from menus. To create
           menus, VAX ACMS supports DECforms as its primary presenta-
           tion service. In addition, VAX ACMS provides support for VAX
           TDMS and other presentation service products.

           VAX ACMS also provides support for other presentation ser-
           vice products through the VAX ACMS Request Interface and Sys-
           tems Interface. The Request Interface lets users use pre-
           sentation services other than DECforms or TDMS for I/O func-
           tions limited to one user per process. The Systems Inter-
           face lets users use presentation services for single-user
           or multiple-user I/O functions.

           Database Management

           VAX ACMS includes support in its definition language for start-
           ing and ending database transactions/recovery units through
           a database management system. Data products supported in-
           clude VAX Rdb/VMS (including SQL), RMS, and VAX DBMS.

           Using the DECdtm component of the VMS Operating System, VAX ACMS
           lets users coordinate operations on multiple recoverable re-
           sources (such as databases and files) within a single atomic
           transaction. Users can perform operations on multiple databases
           through a single transaction, and ensure atomicity (that is,

                                       7

 



           VAX ACMS, Version 3.2                       SPD 25.50.10
           (Application Control and Management System)

           if the transaction fails, any changes made to databases, files,
           or VAX ACMS queues are rolled back to their previous state
           before the transaction started). Support for DECdtm is in-
           troduced in VAX ACMS V3.2.

           VAX ACMS applications can also access other data management
           products or file management systems that support the VMS call-
           ing standard.

           Data Dictionary

           VAX ACMS supports the VAX CDD/Plus data dictionary. VAX ACMS
           stores application definitions in VAX CDD/Plus directories
           and uses VAX CDD/Plus record definitions for its workspaces.

           Queuing

           Some VAX ACMS applications require that the data be collected
           and stored in a temporary storage area (queue) for the ap-
           plication to process at another time. The VAX ACMS queuing
           facility lets users create and manage VAX ACMS task queues.
           ACMS queue services are used to place/remove tasks on/off
           ACMS task queues.

           Security

           VAX ACMS ensures that the user's data remains secure by giv-
           ing the user control over which users have access to VAX ACMS.
           Using VMS and VAX ACMS authorization facilities users can:

           o  Authorize users to use VAX ACMS

           o  Control terminals connecting to VAX ACMS

           o  Limit the applications a user can run

           VAX ACMS includes transaction security in the form of ac-
           cess control lists (ACLs) in the definition language. When-
           ever a user selects a transaction, that user's VMS identi-
           fier is checked against the ACL defined for that transac-
           tion to determine if that user is allowed to execute that
           transaction.

           VAXcluster Environment/Availability

           In a VAXcluster environment, VAX ACMS applications support
           highly available configurations that help avoid single points
           of system failure.

           VAX ACMS includes support for failover in a VAXcluster en-
           vironment. If one VAXcluster processor is not available to
           process a transaction, VAX ACMS can automatically route the
           transaction to another application running on an available
           processor that shares the same data.

           VAX ACMS can improve the performance of a database manage-
           ment system in a VAXcluster environment by allowing the use
           of the client/server model to run database servers on a sin-
           gle processor.

           VAX ACMS Run-time Option

           The VAX ACMS Run-time Option is a subset of VAX ACMS, which
           lets users run existing VAX ACMS applications or programs
           and change application attributes (for example, menu def-
           initions). The purpose of the Run-time Option is to support
           the execution of applications developed on a host machine
           using the development version of this product, and to run
           on production machines.

           VAX ACMS Remote Access Option

           The VAX ACMS Remote Access Option is a subset of the Run-
           time Option and provides the ability to place users and the
           terminal I/O associated with them on a separate VAX system,
           offloaded from the application VAX or VAXcluster.

           Documentation

           VAX ACMS includes a complete and comprehensive documenta-
           tion set. Introductory manuals explain VAX ACMS concepts and
           components to new users. Advanced guides describe, in task-
           oriented style, how to design, build and manage VAX ACMS ap-
           plications. Complete reference information is also provided.
