 PRODUCT NAME:  VAX FORTRAN, Version 5.8                SPD 25.16.39

 DESCRIPTION

 VAX FORTRAN is an implementation of full language
 FORTRAN-77 conforming to American National Standard FORTRAN, ANSI X3.9-
 1978. It includes optional support for programs conforming to the pre-
 vious standard, ANSI X3.9-1966. VAX FORTRAN meets the Federal Infor-
 mation Processing Standard Publication (FIPS-69-1) requirements by con-
 forming to the ANSI Standard and by including a flagger. The flagger
 optionally produces diagnostic messages for compile-time elements that
 do not conform to the Full-Level ANSI FORTRAN X3.9-1978 Standard. VAX FORTRAN
 also conforms to the International Standard ISO 1539-1980(E). VAX FORTRAN
 conforms to MIL-STD 1753 with the exception of the specific syntax for
 octal and hex constants.

 The shareable, reentrant compiler operates under the VMS Operating Sys-
 tem. It globally optimizes source programs while taking advantage of
 the VAX floating point and character string instruction set and the
 VMS virtual memory system.

 VAX FORTRAN includes the following enhancements
 to the ANSI standard:

 o  Directives to support parallel decomposition of DO-loops on mul-
    tiprocessor VMS systems

 o  Directives to control listing page titles and subtitles, object file
    identification field, and some attributes of common blocks

 o  Composite data declarations using STRUCTURE, END STRUCTURE, and RECORD
    statements, and access to record components through field refer-
    ences

                               DIGITAL                    April 1992

                                                         AE-JF87P-TE

 

 o  A set of data types beyond those specified for full language FORTRAN-77:

    -  LOGICAL*1, BYTE

    -  LOGICAL*2

    -  INTEGER*2

    -  COMPLEX*16, DOUBLE COMPLEX

    -  REAL*16

 o  Explicit specification of storage allocation units for data types
    (e.g., REAL*8, INTEGER*4)

 o  Data initialization in type declaration statements

 o  IMPLICIT NONE statement

 o  INCLUDE statement

 o  NAMELIST-directed I/O

 o  31-character identifiers that can include dollar sign ($) and un-
    derscore (_)

 o  DO WHILE and ENDDO statements

 o  Bit manipulation functions

 o  Language elements for keyed and sequential access to VAX RMS in-
    dexed organization files

 o  Hexadecimal and octal constants and Z and O format edit descrip-
    tors applicable to all data types

 o  ENCODE and DECODE statements

 o  ACCEPT and TYPE input/output statements

 o  DEFINE FILE statement

 o  USEROPEN subroutine invocation at file OPEN time

 o  Comments allowed at end of each source line

 o  Debug statements in source

                                  2

 

 o  Language elements that support the VAX extended range and extended
    precision floating point architectural features:

    -  64-bit G_floating data type, with an 11-bit exponent and 53-bit
       mantissa, which provides a range of 0.56*10**-308 to 0.09*10**308
       and a precision of 15 decimal digits

    -  128 bit H_floating data type, with a 15-bit exponent and a 113-
       bit mantissa, which provides a range of 0.84*10**-4932 to 0.59*10**4932
       and a precision of 33 decimal digits

 Additional Features

 o  Generation of optional diagnostic messages for extensions not sup-
    ported by Digital's ULTRIX and VAXELN Operating Systems

 o  Support for translation of VAX CDD/Plus records into FORTRAN records

 o  Support for calls to VMS system service procedures

 o  Generation of symbol tables for the VAX Symbolic Debugger

 o  Generation of Cross Reference Listings

 o  Generation of shareable code

 o  Up to 255 actual arguments in a CALL statement

 o  Up to 250 named COMMON blocks per subprogram

 o  Support for providing error diagnostics to the VAX Language-Sensitive
    Editor component and cross-reference information to the VAX Source
    Code Analyzer component of VAX Language-Sensitive Editor/Source Code
    Analyzer

 o  Support for low level program design, including the processing of
    pseudocode and the extraction of design information from comments

 The VAX FORTRAN compiler provides a multi-phase optimizer that is ca-
 pable of performing optimizations across entire program units. Spe-
 cific optimizations performed include:

 o  Constant folding

 o  Optimizations of arithmetic IF, logical IF, and block IF-THEN-ELSE

                                  3

 

 o  Global common subexpression elimination

 o  Removal of invariant expressions from loops

 o  Global allocation of general registers across program units

 o  In-line expansion of statement functions

 o  Optimization of array addressing in loops

 o  Value propagation

 o  Deletion of redundant and unreachable code

 Note: VAX FORTRAN does not support the use of FDML statements within
 parallel DO-loops.
