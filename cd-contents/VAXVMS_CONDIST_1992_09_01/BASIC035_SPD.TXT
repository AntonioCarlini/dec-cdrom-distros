           Processors Restrictions

           A TK50 Tape Drive is required for standalone MicroVAX 2000
           and VAXstation 2000 systems.

           Block Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1):

           Disk space required         6,800 blocks
           during installation:
                                       (3.5M bytes)

           VAX BASIC, Version 3.5                    SSA 25.36.21-A



           Disk space required for     6,600 blocks
           use (permanent):
                                       (3.4M bytes)

           These counts refer to the disk space required on the sys-
           tem disk. The sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary
           depending on the user's system environment, configuration,
           and software options.

           Memory Requirements for DECwindows Support:

           The minimum supported memory for this application running
           in a standalone DECwindows environment with both the client
           and server executing on that same system is 8 MB.

           OPTIONAL HARDWARE

           Floating point intensive applications should be run on con-
           figurations with the appropriate hardware support for the
           floating point data types being used. Consult the base op-
           erating system SPD for the Floating Point Accelerator or other
           floating point hardware appropriate for your configuration.

           CLUSTER ENVIRONMENT

           This layered product is fully supported when installed on
           any valid and licensed VAXcluster* configuration without re-
           strictions. The HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS sections of this prod-
           uct's Software Product Description and System Support Ad-
           dendum detail any special hardware required by this prod-
           uct.

           *  V5.x VAXcluster configurations are fully described in the
              VAXcluster Software Product Description (29.78.xx) and
              include CI, Ethernet, and Mixed Interconnect configura-
              tions.

           SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

           For Systems Using Terminals: (No DECwindows Interface):

           o  VMS Operating System V5.0 - V5.4

           For Workstations Running VWS:

           o  VMS Operating System V5.0 - V5.4

           o  VMS Workstation Software V4.2 - V4.3

           For Workstations Running DECwindows:

           o  VMS Operating System V5.1 - V5.4 (and necessary compo-
              nents of VMS DECwindows)

           VAX BASIC supports a DECwindows compiler interface for com-
           pile qualifier selection on workstations. This interface is
           accessible from FileView.

           This product may run in either of the following ways:

           o  Stand-alone execution - running the X11 display server
              and the client application on the same machine.

           o  Remote execution - running the X11 display server and the
              client application on different machines.

           VMS DECwindows is part of the VMS Operating System but must
           be installed separately on versions prior to V5.4. Instal-
           lation of VMS DECwindows gives users the option to install
           any or all of the following three components:

           o  VMS DECwindows Compute Server (Base kit; includes run-
              time support)

           o  VMS DECwindows Device Support

           o  VMS DECwindows Programming Support
