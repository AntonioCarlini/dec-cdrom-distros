PRODUCT NAME: VAXimage Scanning Application, Version 1.0	SPD 25.D4.00

DESCRIPTION

VAXimage Scanning Application (VSA) is a VAXstation based application for 
using the MD300 Image Scanner. Capabilities include preview of images, 
adjustment of images, creating DDIF files from scanned images, and mailing 
image files. 

VSA supports VMS DECwindows.  VSA uses DECwindows pull-down menus, windows, 
keyboard, and mouse for operation. Files created using VSA can be used by 
other applications that operate on image files in DDIF (DIGITAL's Document 
Interchange Format).

VAXimage Scanning Application uses the DIGITAL MD300 Image Scanner for 
scanning. The scanner requires connection to a Q-bus based VAX or VAXstation. 
VSA provides access from any VAXstation (running DECwindows) to a local or 
remote scanner within a DECnet LAN.

VAXimage Scanning Application includes the following features:
  
Scanner Setup

^ Scanner selection (reserves a local or remote connected MD300 Image 
  Scanner)

  - CONTRAST

  - BRIGHTNESS

  - RESOLUTION        (75 to 300 DPI)

  - PAGE SIZE         (A, A4, or LEGAL)

  - MODE              (line art or halftone) 

  - SCAN FRAMING      (selects size of area to be scanned using 
                       rubberband or by specifying co-ordinates)

  - WINDOW SETUP      (specify up to four windows that can be scanned 
                       in halftone mode if line art is selected for the
                       area of the document outside the windows, or
                       line art if halftone is selected)

  - Select units of measurement for framing and window setup (inches or 
    centimeters)

Preview Image - Displays the image scaled to fit into the preview window 
or magnified to display each pixel of the scanned image. MAGNIFY mode 
allows the image to be panned across the preview window and provides a 
separate panned area that indicates the portion of the image being 
previewed. The amount of magnification depends on the resolution of the
scanned image. Higher resolution causes greater magnification.

Edit Functions

CROP - Allows selection of a rectangular region of the original 
image and deletes the remainder.

WASH - Allows selection of a rectangular region of the original
image that can be set to all white or all black.

REVERSE - Allows selection of a rectangular region of the original
image and inverts the pixel values within the region (white
to black and black to white).

ROTATE - Rotates the entire image by a specified angle from -360 to
+360 degrees.

UNDO - Allows the user to undo the last edit function.

File Functions

SAVE AS - Creates a file in DDIF format of the scanned image using 
the user-defined file specifications.

OPEN AS - Reads a DDIF formated image file for preview and edit.
(uncompressed or compressed CCITT Group III or Group IV)

MAIL TO - Mails the scanned image to a local or remote DECwindows
Mail user.

CLIPBOARD - Sends the image in memory to the DECwindows Clipboard for 
pasting in a different area.

Customize Functions - Allows the user to retain settings that customize the
operation of ImageScan. 

The following settings can be saved:

Preview  - ON or OFF

MAGNIFY  - ON or OFF

Feed Mode - Single page or multiple pages from the automatic sheet 
feeder (included with the MD300 Scanner).

Scan Pages - Selects the number of pages to be scanned in multiple pages
mode.

File Name - Creates a default file name for automatic filing.

Compress  - Selects compressed (CCITT Group IV 2D) or decompressed 
format when creating image files.

VAXimage Scanning Application also includes DCL/IMAGE which provides a DCL 
command line interface to a limited set of features. DCL/IMAGE can be used 
from a terminal or terminal emulator but requires DECwindows to be installed 
on the system at all times because DCL/IMAGE uses files that are part of 
DECwindows. 

DCL IMAGE commands include:

^ IMAGE SCAN - Supports scanning on the MD300 scanner and provides 
  limited control over these scanner features - brightness, 
  contrast, mode (halftone or line art), and resolution.

^ IMAGE RENDER - Makes an image file suitable for display or output to
  a printer.							      

^ IMAGE VIEW - Allows viewing of a rendered image on a workstation

^ IMAGE ADJUST - Allows rotation, cropping, and scalling of the original 
  image.

^ IMAGE CONVERT - Converts an image file created using Microtek (TM)
  Eyestar software to DDIF format for inclusion in compound documents.
