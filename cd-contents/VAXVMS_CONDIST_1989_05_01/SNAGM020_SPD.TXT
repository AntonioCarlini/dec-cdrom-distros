PRODUCT NAME: DECnet/SNA VMS Gateway Management, Version 2.0     SPD 29.70.00

DESCRIPTION 
  
DECnet/SNA VMS Gateway Management V2.0 provides configuration and
management functions for use with DECnet/SNA Gateway for Synchronous 
Transport V1.0 (DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST) and DECnet/SNA Gateway for Channel 
Transport V1.0 (DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT) products. Both DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST 
and DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT are products designed to allow users to 
bidirectionally exchange information and share resources between suitably 
configured DIGITAL systems in a DECnet environment and IBM systems in a 
Systems Network Architecture (SNA) environment. Please refer to the
appropriate DECnet/SNA Gateway Software Product Description for more 
information on those products. 

DECnet/SNA VMS Gateway Management V2.0 allows the Gateway administrator to
configure the software executing in the DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST or DECnet/SNA
Gateway-CT System. This product 
allows the administrator to set up parameters relating to lines, circuits,
physical units, logical units, and other key variables necessary for 
network to network communications between the DECnet and SNA networks. 
Additionally, DECnet/SNA VMS Gateway Management V2.0 allows the 
administrator to manage and diagnose problems related to the DECnet/SNA 
Gateway.

DECnet/SNA VMS Gateway Management V2.0

DECnet/SNA VMS Gateway Management V2.0  software is required on 
the DIGITAL load host node for DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT and/or DECnet/SNA 
Gateway-ST. It must also be present on any other VMS node whose users  
want to manage a DEC MicroServer (DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST) or DEC ChannelServer 
(DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT) based Gateway.  It is strongly recommended that the 
software also be installed on VMS systems where IBM Interconnect 
application programs are developed using any of the DECnet/SNA Programming 
Interface products in order to facilitate debugging functions.

DECnet/SNA VMS Gateway Management V2.0 can be used to configure and 
monitor both DEC MicroServer and DEC ChannelServer based Gateway products. 
It does not support DECnet/SNA Gateway V1.x (DECSA-FA/DX24) Gateways, which 
are still managed by using the DECnet/SNA VMS Gateway Management V1.x 
product.

Gateway management includes DECnet style network management tools for 
configuring, controlling, monitoring, and troubleshooting the DECnet/SNA 
Gateway itself.  These activities may be performed by the DIGITAL system 
manager of a designated host node on the Ethernet Local Area Network for the 
DECnet/SNA Gateway. All management functions are performed from a node on the 
DIGITAL network, rather than at or on the Gateway itself.  

Management of the DECnet/SNA Gateway should be viewed as part of the DIGITAL 
environment while the management of the lines and/or channel connecting the 
DECnet/SNA Gateway to the IBM system is a joint responsibility of the IBM and 
DIGITAL systems managers.  (Refer to the Customer Responsibilities section at 
the end of this Software Product Description.)

Controlling and Monitoring the Gateway

DECnet/SNA VMS Gateway Management V2.0 allows a DIGITAL system operator to 
remotely bootstrap or restart a DECnet/SNA Gateway and provide configuration 
and initialization facilities for the DECnet/SNA Gateway.  

Problem Isolation and Determination Tools for the Gateway

In addition to event logging and error counters, a wide range of fault 
isolation tools are included.  

A trace capability for use with the DECnet/SNA Gateway(s) is provided to help 
debug application programs as well as assist in identifying system problems. 
An operator can run a trace at the Line/Circuit, Physical Unit (PU), or Session 
level and then format the data on a specified DIGITAL system. The trace 
feature is helpful in identifying an error for remedial action.

A ``snapshot'' monitoring utility is provided to display on a DIGITAL 
host-controlled terminal the status of the Gateway's buffer availability,  
the number of SNA sessions currently in progress, and other information 
that pertains to both the DECnet and SNA network.

If an irrecoverable error should occur during operation of the 
DECnet/SNA Gateway system, a memory image may be dumped to a designated Ethernet
attached VAX host.

New and Changed Features

This  section  lists the  major  differences  between
DECnet/SNA VMS Gateway Management V2.0 and DECnet/SNA VMS Gateway Management 
V1.x:

      ^  DECnet/SNA VMS Gateway Management V2.0 supports both DEC MicroServer 
         and DEC ChannelServer based gateway products. It is not intended 
         to be used in DECSA-FA/DX24 based DECnet/SNA Gateway V1.x systems.

      ^  A simplified  configuration  procedure  -  After  installing
         DECnet/SNA VMS Gateway Management and DECnet/SNA Gateway load host
         software, you run a single configuration procedure appropriate
         for the type of DECnet/SNA Gateway to be used. This  configuration 
         procedure creates files that define items for the DECnet
         database on the load  host,  and the SNA and DECnet databases on the 
         Gateway.

      ^  A new DECnet/SNA VMS Gateway Management utility - SNANCP is a  
         Gateway Management Version  2.0 utility  that allows you to manage 
         DECnet/SNA Gateway components, such as lines, circuits, and PUs.

      ^  Expanded NCP command support - More  NCP  commands  are  now
         supported  by  the  Gateway  to  manage the Gateway to DECnet
         components, such as lines and circuits.

      ^  Improved DHCF Management - The DHCF server, like  the  other
         servers, is now managed with SNANCP commands.


INSTALLATION

Installation services for this product are covered under the              
Gateway Orientation/Installation Service which is REQUIRED in conjunction
with the customer's first purchase of a DECnet/SNA Gateway if the
installation is to be warranted and supported by DIGITAL.
 
An installation service is also available for the simultaneous
