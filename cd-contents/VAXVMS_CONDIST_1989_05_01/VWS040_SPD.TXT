graphics support for the VAXstation II, VAXstation II/GPX, VAXstation 
2000, VAXstation 2000 Color, VAXstation 3200/3500.

VMS Workstation Software provides the VAXstations with windowing
support, VT200 series terminal emulation with technical character set,
TEK4014 (r) emulation, a simple mouse-based human interface for window
manipulation, a graphics programming interface, and VWS/SIGHT, an

VAXstations configured in a Local Area VAXcluster system VMS
Workstation Software runs on VMS.

Features

^  Multiple Overlapping Windowing System - Via the mouse, multiple
   windows may be created, moved, overlapped and resized at will. Windows
   may be popped to the top of the screen or pushed to the bottom of the
   screen stacking order. Windows may also be created and manipulated
   under program control.

^  VT200 series terminal and TEK4014 Emulation - Multiple VT220,
   VT240, or TK4014 windows may be present on the screen at the same
   time.

^  ReGIS Color Support - Provides VT240-compatible subset of
   video-ReGIS graphics.  Hardcopy output is provided only through the
   UIS print screen service.

^  Simple Human Interface - Via the mouse, the keyboard may be
   switched to an alternate window, new VT200-series windows created, 
   or the screen printed to an LA100, LA120, LA210, LA50, or LJ250 hardcopy
   devices.

^  Workstation Setup - Allows the workstation characteristics to be
   configured to customer requirements.

^  On-line Help is available on the human interface.

^  Programming Interface - For workstation application development, a
   graphics and windowing programming interface called User Interface
   Service (UIS) is provided.

^  Device Driver Interface - For applications with special requirements, 
   a device driver interface to the graphics hardware is provided.

^  Hardcopy Graphics Support - For applications requiring the
   generation of hardcopy output of graphics, Hardcopy UIS (HCUIS) is
   provided.  HCUIS enables applications to translate UIS display lists
   to the formats needed to print them on a variety of hardcopy devices.
   The HCUIS routines also enable applications to create UIS files from
   the UIS display list.  The HCUIS DCL interface also allows users to
   translate UIS files to the formats needed to print them on a variety
   of hardcopy devices.

^  SIGHT (Simple Interactive Graphics Handling Tool) - Enables the
   user to create graphics on a workstation. These graphics are stored in
   files for graphic output to hardcopy devices. These files can then be
   updated and/or transferred or copied to other supported VAXstations.
