PRODUCT NAME:  VAX Packetnet System Interface (VAX P.S.I.),    SPD 25.40.14   
               Version 4.2

DESCRIPTION
 
The VAX Packetnet System Interface (VAX P.S.I.) product allows
suitably configured VMS systems to connect to Packet Switching
Data Networks (PSDNs) conforming to CCITT recommendation X.25 (1978,
1980 or 1984) and/or to International Standards (ISO) 7776 and 8208. 
Table 1 below lists those public (in the sense of publicly accessible)
PSDNs with which VAX P.S.I. is supported. 

It enables process-to-process and terminal communications between a
VAX and remote Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) in a PSDN supporting the
ISO or X.25 interface protocols, or direct connection to equipment
acting as either Data Circuit Terminating Equipment (DCE) or DTE using
the ISO protocols, or to any combination of PSDNs and equipments
subject to the limitations noted below. The term DCE in this SPD
refers to ISO point-to-point communications only; VAX P.S.I. does not
provide any packet-switching exchange facilities. 

VAX P.S.I. allows a standard VAX system configuration to function as one
of the following: 

^  A packet-mode DTE connected to a supported PSDN

^  A packet-mode DTE connected to a DCE conforming to International standards
   7776 and 8208

^  A packet-mode DCE connected to a DTE conforming to International standards
   7776 and 8208

^  A combination of the above modes, chosen on a per-line basis (except in 
   the case of the KMS11-B multi-line device, where all lines must use the 
   same mode of operation and connect to the same PSDN).

In the rest of this SPD, descriptions referring to PSDNs also apply to
supported ISO point-to-point connections unless otherwise stated. 

VAX P.S.I. can be configured for either Multi-host or Native mode operation.

^  Native VAX P.S.I. supports connection to one or more PSDNs, each of which
   may have one or more DTEs

^  Multi-host VAX P.S.I. provides all the features offered with VAX P.S.I. plus
   the ability for VAX P.S.I. Access systems to use a PSDN as though connected
   directly 

Refer to the ``Communications Interfaces'' section for details of the
hardware interfaces and number of connections supported per configuration. 

VAX P.S.I. is a layered product on VMS, and may be used in the following 
ways: 

^  Process-to-process (X.25) communication

   VAX P.S.I. supports access for VMS user programs written in VAX MACRO 
   and Native mode high-level languages such as VAX FORTRAN. Programs 
   executing in PDP-11 compatibility mode cannot use VAX P.S.I.

^  Process-to-terminal (X.29) communication

   Users of the VAX node may make outgoing calls to other DIGITAL or 
   non-DIGITAL CPUs or suitable network PADs accessible via the PSDN(s), by 
   programming interface or by using the host-based PAD supplied with VAX 
   P.S.I. The latter feature employs a DCL-style command syntax, offering the 
   ability to reference the CCITT PAD parameters symbolically, as well as an 
   interface that conforms to the standard CCITT command signals.  The 
   host-based PAD also offers the capability of running multiple X.29 sessions 
   using the VMS SPAWN and ATTACH commands.

   The X.29 programming interface allows generation of PAD reselection 
   messages.  The host-based PAD supports reception of a PAD reselect message.
   This feature allows X.29 calls to be redirected to another DTE.  Before 
   using the PAD reselection facility check that it is supported by the PAD.  
  
^  Terminal-to-Process (X.29) communication

   Remote terminals connected to the PSDN(s) may access the VAX host running 
   VAX P.S.I. by means of an X.29 Switched Virtual Circuit call. The X.29 
   Virtual Terminal driver conforms to the VMS Port and Class driver 
   architecture, thus providing compatibility with the interface provided by 
   a locally connected terminal.

^  Full DECnet communication

   The VAX P.S.I. product allows the use of DECnet-VAX facilities over X.25 
   circuits; this technique is known as Data Link Mapping (DLM).  A 
   DECnet-VAX license is required to communicate with other DECnet nodes via 
   a PSDN(s).  For details please refer to DECnet-VAX (SPD 25.03.xx).

^  Open System Interconnection

   VAX P.S.I. may be used for Open System Interconnection (OSI) 
   communication, when used with the VAX OSI Transport Service (VOTS) product 
   (refer to SPD 27.15.xx). 

 For all the above uses, VAX P.S.I. provides the following additional features:

^  The ability to collect accounting information on the usage of P.S.I. is 
   included in the product. The Accounting utility provided with the product 
   is compatible with the VMS Accounting utility.

^  A security mechanism, consistent with the VMS access and security 
   mechanisms, is available. The security utility offers the means of 
   controlling both remote access to the VAX system or local access to the 
   PSDN(s), on a per-PSDN or individual remote DTE number basis.  Outbound
   calls from any machine using VAX P.S.I. Access can be controlled by        
   Multi-host systems.                                                        
 
^  For communications between two VMS systems running VAX                 
   P.S.I. or VAX P.S.I. Access, the VAX P.S.I. product permits the transfer 
   of electronic mail using the VMS mail facility (refer to VMS 
   Operating System SPD 25.01.xx) even in the absence of any DECnet 
   communications between the two DTEs.

These additional features are described in more detail below.

Virtual Circuits
 
VAX P.S.I. (in Native mode, or configured for Multi-host access) offers
communication over both Permanent and Switched Virtual Circuits (PVC and
SVC), and support up to 512 virtual circuits in total per CPU.  One virtual
circuit is used for each incoming or outgoing terminal connection, for
each X.25 call, for each PVC and for each DECnet Data Link Mapping circuit 
active.               

The maximum number of terminals supported (both local and X.29 remote) must
not exceed the number supported by VMS. 

Line Discipline and Conformance to Standards

The electrical line discipline used for PSDN communications depends on the
hardware interface device used.  VAX P.S.I. provides only the electrical 
interface of a DTE rather than that of a DCE, and does not provide clock
signals.  An external clock source (e.g. a modem) is therefore required.  

The range of supported devices cover V.24, V.35 and V.10, RS232, RS422 and 
RS423 over point-to-point, 4-wire, synchronous, full-duplex lines at 
transmission rates up to 64K bits per second. 

Frame generation and recognition (not protocol) is High-Level Data Link
Control (HDLC), per International Standard 3309.  Bisynchronous (BSC) framing
is not supported. 

VAX P.S.I. complies with CCITT recommendation X.25 (1978, 1980 or 1984) and/or
with International Standards 8208 and 7776, supporting the symmetric LAPB
variant of the X.25 data link level protocol (with or without extended
sequence numbering), and the X.25 packet level protocol. LAPB with extended
sequence numbering is referred to as LAPBE in the remainder of this SPD. 

Table 2 of this SPD describes the particular aspects of the CCITT X.25
recommendation that VAX P.S.I. can support, but actual support for any given
feature depends on the PSDN in use. 

Process-to-Process Communication

The VAX P.S.I. programming interface allows application programs to
access the service interface to the packet level via the standard VMS
QIO interface. Functions include the setting up and breaking of
network connections, data transmission and reception, sending and
receiving of interrupt messages, and resetting of virtual circuits.
The interface also provides for splitting and recombination of
messages which are longer than the packet size selected for the
circuit. 
 
This interface enables an application program using VMS System Services
to communicate with complementary software on other systems (DIGITAL or
non-DIGITAL DTEs) accessible via the X.25 connection. 

Terminal Communications
 
VAX P.S.I. supports terminal communications according to CCITT
recommendations X.3, X.28, and X.29. Only those terminal parameters
defined in the X.3 recommendation are explicitly supported;
network-specific enhancements or extensions to the X.3 parameters are
available at both the X.29 and the host-based PAD user interface. 
Terminal processes that depend on these extensions may cause problems
when used on other PSDNs or when accessing one PSDN via another (for
example, international access). 

^  Outgoing terminal traffic

   Using the Host-Based Packet Assembly/Disassembly (PAD) facility, terminals 
   connected locally (logically or physically) to the VMS system may 
   communicate with remote DTEs over the PSDN(s). Such terminals may connect 
   to remote DTEs in a manner identical to the way in which remote terminals  
   can connect over a PSDN. This utility accepts DCL-style commands, or 
   CCITT X.28 commands.

^  Incoming terminal traffic

   The X.29 Interactive Terminal Interface allows remote asynchronous 
   terminals (character-mode DTEs) connected to the network to communicate 
   with the VMS system in a manner similar to local terminals.  

   Dissimilarities may appear as a result of delays caused by the PSDN(s) and 
   the various PAD parameter settings chosen by the user or peculiar to the 
   PSDN(s).  In this case, the remote PAD must perform code conversions 
   between ASCII and the code the terminal uses.  (There may be some 
   restrictions imposed by the PSDN(s) itself.)  

The interface an X.29 terminal uses is compatible with the interface a local
terminal uses, except for those facilities where the PSDN does not provide
adequate support.  The X.29 interface includes support for specific X.29
signaling.  For example, the break key can be used to disable output, and
the interrupt message can be mapped directly to the VMS interrupt
character. 

A similar programming interface to the X.25 one is provided, so that a
VMS process can control the virtual circuit (for example, to modify PAD
parameters or clear a call). This program interface can also be used to make
an outgoing call to a remote PAD. 

The use of PVCs for X.29 connections is not defined by the 1980, 1984 CCITT  
recommendations, and hence is not available with VAX P.S.I. 

Accounting

The Accounting utility enables the system manager to obtain information on
P.S.I. and network usage.  The Accounting utility can extract the information
collected and display the information directly on a terminal or to a file.
The information can be extracted for selected records, or a summary can be
produced. 

In the case of incoming X.29 calls, no information can be stored relating to
the process/account on to which a user is logged; this may be obtained by      
correlation with VMS accounting records. 

Security

The security utility offers the means of controlling both remote DTE access
to VAX P.S.I., and access to the PSDN(s) by VMS processes.  The Security
utility allows for access control on the basis of: 

^  Whether or not the call is normally or reverse charged,

^  The remote DTE numbers involved, either on the basis of individual DTE 
   numbers or groups of DTE numbers with common leading digits,

^  The process making the outgoing call or the application handling the 
   incoming call.

In addition, when configured in Multi-host operation, VAX P.S.I. can
apply security checks to both incoming calls to and outgoing calls
from VAX P.S.I. Access nodes. Security on both the VAX P.S.I. and the
VAX P.S.I. Access node is required for comprehensive protection. 

Network Management 

VMS provides a Network Control Program (NCP) for management of both
DECnet-VAX and the VAX P.S.I. product.  This program provides Network 
Management facilities to define the line(s) and PSDN(s) to which the system
is connected, select the mode (DTE or DCE) of each, specify addressing
information for incoming calls, access counters, and perform other
maintenance functions.  The manager can modify network databases, (for
example, add new incoming call destinations), thus controlling network
operation.  Event logging is available via normal VMS mechanisms. 

Problem solving is facilitated by the ability to test components of the total
network, and trace and analyze frames passing between the PSDN and the VAX
P.S.I. system. 

Communications Interfaces

The types of communications interfaces VAX P.S.I. supports, as described
below, differ in many respects, particularly in their effect upon CPU
utilization. For the best performance, customers are recommended to use a DMA
device.  Table 3 (at the end of this SPD) is provided to aid in the
configuration of physical hardware supported by VAX P.S.I. and shows
supported line-speeds.   Refer to the Software Requirements section for       
information on the synchronous driver products.

^  The DUP11 (UNIBUS) and DPV11-DA or -S (Q-bus) for LAPB or LAPBE datalink  
   handling are character interrupt devices where CPU cycles are required 
   for X.25 packet and data link level protocol processing, and also for 
   each character sent and received.

^  The DMF32 (UNIBUS) and DMB32 (BI-BUS) are multi-function devices which 
   include a single DMA line. The communications controllers perform 
   character transmission, reception, and HDLC framing in microcode. The VAX 
   CPU then processes the X.25 data link (LAPB or LAPBE) and packet level 
   protocols. In the case of the DMF32, only rev. J (and later) is supported 
   with the VAX P.S.I. software, and rev. M is required for simultaneous 
   operation of the printer port with VAX P.S.I.  For the DMB32 rev.J is
   required. 

^  The DST32 is a single line synchronous communications device for the        
   MicroVAX 2000.  The DST32 supports DMA transfers for bit oriented protocols.
   The communications controller performs character transmission, reception,   
   and HDLC framing in the microcode.  The MicroVAX 2000 CPU then processes the
   X.25 data link (LAPB or LAPBE) and packet level protocols.                  

^  The KMS1P-A, KMS1P-B and KMS11-B (UNIBUS) products are DMA devices. The 
   KMS communications controller executes character transmission, reception, 
   and X.25 data link level protocol processing in microcode (LAPB only, for 
   packets not larger than 1024 bytes). The VAX CPU then processes the X.25 
   packet level protocol. Optional link-level software products and tools 
   available for the KMS devices are not required.  The KMS1P-A and -B were 
   previously known as the KMS11-PX and -PY.

   In the case of the KMS11-B eight-line device, all lines in use must be 
   connected to the same network, and must be in the same mode (DTE or DCE).

^  The KMV1A-A or -SF (Q-bus) communications controller executes transmission, 
   reception, and X.25 link level protocol processing in microcode (LAPB only,
   for packets not larger than 1024 bytes). The CPU then processes the X.25 
   packet level protocol. Optional link-level software products, drivers and 
   tools, available for the KMV1A device, are not required.  The KMV1A device
   was previously known as the KMV11-A.

PREREQUISITE SUPPORT
 
The customer and DIGITAL must jointly prepare a Network Profile and Customer
Support Plan covering all the intended network nodes, their usage of SVCs,
PVCs, and other network facilities, and their support. 

INSTALLATION

DIGITAL requires that a customer's first purchase of this software product    
include DIGITAL Installation Services.  These services provide for            
installation of the software product by an experienced DIGITAL Software       
Specialist. 

Only customers experienced with DIGITAL's X.25 products should attempt second 
or subsequent installations.  DIGITAL recommends that all other customers     
purchase DIGITAL's Installation Services. 

Customer Responsibilities

In some cases the X.25 network supplier (or PTT) may impose restrictions,     
limitations, or requirements on the proposed DIGITAL network configuration.   
The customer must ensure they understand and adhere to these controls for each
and every network.

Before installation of the software, the customer must:

^  Previously have installed all requisite software and hardware, including 
   terminals.
   
^  Obtain, install and demonstrate as operational any modems and other 
   equipment and facilities necessary to interface to DIGITAL's communication
   equipment.
   
^  Demonstrate equivalence of operation for modems other than Bell 208A, 
   208B, 209, 212A synchronous modems, or in Europe PTT approved modems.

^  Subscribe to the Open User Group and to at least two SVCs to be able to    
   complete the product's installation checkout (this tests loops information 
   from the VAX P.S.I. system to the PSDN and back to VAX P.S.I. system).     
   Systems that use PVCs or Closed User Groups only, or where the PSDN does not
   support calls to the same DTE address, require specially negotiated         
   arrangements for DIGITAL installation of the product.                       

^  Make available for a reasonable period of time, as mutually agreed by 
   DIGITAL and the customer, all hardware, communication facilities and 
   terminals that are to be used during installation.

Delays caused by any failure to meet the responsibilities will be charged at
the then prevailing rate for time and materials.

		  Table 2 - Optional Facility Support

VAX P.S.I. support for any given CCITT X.25 facility depends on support for it
in the appropriate supported PSDN.  Generally, VAX P.S.I. is designed to
disallow use of facilities that the PSDN will not support.  The following
table is therefore to be interpreted as what VAX P.S.I. is capable of doing,
rather than what it will do when used on any particular PSDN.  The product
documentation describes specific facility availability for the supported
public PSDNs.

Notes:

1. This is not applicable to a DTE.  VAX P.S.I. does not support receiving a 
   level 3 Reject packet, and will not generate one.

2. The individual DTEs must be assigned their own addresses independent of 
   the hunt group address.  VAX P.S.I. can then ignore the hunt group. 
   Alternatively, each line on the same CPU can be configured as if it were 
   connected to a separate PSDN, each with the same DTE address. 

3. VAX P.S.I. does not generate these statistics, but incoming statistics 
   supplied by the PSDN are available in the accounting records and at the 
   programming interface.
                                                                           
4. VAX P.S.I. does not support the following items of the CCITT X.25 
   recommendation: 

   ^  Multi-link protocol
   ^  Use of the D-bit in outgoing packets.


		 Table 3 - Configuration Guidelines

The table below describes the physical hardware configurations supported by
VAX P.S.I. in terms of CPU type and communication interface, assuming 128 
bytes of user data per packet in a VAX P.S.I. Native mode configuration 
where data is being sent and received at maximum speeds in both directions. 

The numbers given in the tables are ``load costs''.  Load costs indicate the 
overhead of full-duplex packet transfer at the indicated speed.  The load
units are calculated for an application that does no work with 
transmitted/received data, and indicate a maximum packet rate for that 
configuration.  An idle device incurs negligible load.  Systems should be 
configured so they can sustain peak load rates. 

How to use this table:

The maximum system configuration, with a mix of device types, is computed by
adding the load costs (in load units) for each device up to the limit for a
given processor type. 

Example 1:

A VAX 8500 is being used to process VAX P.S.I. Native mode communications:   
if the system uses a DMB32 at 64 kilobits/sec, and another DMB32 
at 19.2 kilobits/sec, the load units total 156.  Assuming these devices are
fully active, they will consume 156/360 = 43% of CPU for communications 
processing.  It would be inadvisable to add more devices to this CPU unless
it is dedicated to the task of communications processing.

Example 2:

When a KMV1A is used on a MicroVAX II at full speed (19.2 kilobits/sec), it
consumes 36/160 = 22% of the processor in processing VAX P.S.I. 
communications.

*  For more than one character interrupt device, multiply the load units by
   50% to allow for interaction between devices.

** The KMS11-BD/BE are eight (8) line devices; the load units indicated above 
   are the load units for each active line at the indicated line speed.

N/S means that use of the device at this speed is not supported by VAX P.S.I. 

Other factors to consider when configuring hardware devices for use with VAX
P.S.I. on a given processor are: 

^  Multi-host mode increases the CPU load of packets to or from P.S.I. Access 
   systems, due to the additional cost of DECnet communications to the chosen
   P.S.I. Access node.

^  Hardware configuration limits, such as power supply, backplane space, bus 
   throughput and mapping registers available, and any other restrictions on 
   the number of devices per CPU or per bus, must be observed.

^  Actual/average Packet size in bytes; generally, doubling the actual packet
   size will halve the load units consumed for DMA devices, but increase the 
   load units for character-interrupt devices by approximately 30 percent.

^  The above tables assume that data is sent and received in each direction 
   of a full-duplex line, in equal ratio. If the number of X.25 packets per 
   second is predominantly one-way, then the load units per line can be 
   reduced proportionately up to a factor of 50%.
