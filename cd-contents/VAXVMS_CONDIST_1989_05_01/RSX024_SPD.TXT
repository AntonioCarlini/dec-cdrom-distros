PRODUCT NAME: VAX-11 RSX, Version 2.4                         SPD 26.73.06
              RSX Operating Systems Emulator            

DESCRIPTION

Overview

VAX-11 RSX is an emulator of the RSX operating system family which executes
on all VAX systems. VAX-11 RSX runs in compatibility mode on processors 
that support a PDP-11 instruction set subset in hardware or microcode and 
also runs on certain processors WITHOUT this support by providing its own
software emulation of the same PDP-11 instruction set subset.  

VAX-11 RSX provides special capabilities which enable PDP-11 users to develop 
programs for execution in the following environments: 

^  VMS compatibility mode (hardware-supported or software-emulated)

^  RSX-11M-PLUS

^  RSX-11M

^  RSX-11S

^  Micro/RSX

^  P/OS

VAX-11 RSX also allows for the migration of many existing RSX applications to
VMS.

Program Development Capabilities

The program development facilities provided by VAX-11 RSX consist of the
following: 

^  The PDP-11 Instruction Set Emulator (CEM$EMULATOR) which emulates the 
   PDP-11 machine instruction set and allows RSX tasks to run on VAX
   processors that do not contain the compatibility mode hardware.

^  The MCR command line interpreter (CLI) which emulates the RSX MCR CLI so 
   that users may interact with a familiar user interface.  MCR also provides 
   access to many of the native VMS program development facilities.

^  The RSX Application Migration Executive (AME) which emulates the RSX 
   Executive services.

^  The Indirect Command File Processor (ICM) which allows RSX indirect 
   command files to be executed on VMS.

^  The DCL command back translator (BACKTRANS) which allows RSX utilities to 
   be invoked through the use of the DCL command interface.

^  A subset of the RSX program development utilities and libraries.

^  A subset of the RMS-11, Version 2.0 program development utilities and 
   libraries.

The following RSX program development utilities are available to users of
VAX-11 RSX: 

^  BRU - Backup and Restore Utility (ODS-1 only). Note that BRU can restore 
   files to existing directories on an ODS-2 volume. However, files on an 
   ODS-2 volume cannot be read by BRU for backup or verify operations.

^  CRF - Cross Reference Processor

^  DMP - File Dump Utility

^  DSC1 - Disk Save and Compress Utility Program (ODS-1 only)

^  EDI - Line Text Editor

^  FLX - File Transfer Utility Program

^  LBR - Librarian Utility Program

^  MAC - PDP-11 MACRO-11 Assembler

^  PAT - Object Module Patch Utility

^  PIP - Peripheral Interchange Program

^  SLP - Source Language Input Program

^  TKB - Task Builder

^  ZAP - Task/File Patch Program

The following RSX program development libraries and components are available
to VAX-11 RSX users: 

^  FCSRES.STB - File Control Services symbol table

The following utilities for file transfer to and from RSX family systems and
other VAX systems are available to VAX-11 RSX users: 

^  DTE - Data Terminal Emulator Utility

^  MFT - File Transfer Utility

Note: MFT has superseded the Professional File Transfer Program (PFT), 
formerly included in the Professional Host Communications product.

General Access

VAX-11 RSX users gain access to the system through the normal VMS LOGINOUT
procedure. They may explicitly request MCR as their CLI or they may have MCR
as their default CLI by having it specified in the User Authorization File. 

Alternatively, VAX-11 RSX users may use the DCL CLI.  Under DCL, not all of
the RSX and RMS program development utilities are directly available.  Some
of the utilities are available through DCL commands (e.g.,  LIBRARY/RSX-11),
but for some other utilities, the user must explicitly request the utility to
execute by typing either RUN SYS$SYSTEM:utility-name or MCR utility-name. 

VAX-11 RSX indirect command files may be executed from either MCR or DCL but
must contain only indirect directives and MCR commands. 

On VMS it is only possible to switch from one CLI to another by logging
out of the current CLI and then logging in again using the new CLI or by
using the DCL or MCR SPAWN command.  This differs from RSX-11M and
RSX-11M-PLUS. 

Operations With Disk and Tape Volumes

In addition to a native disk file structure (Files-11 Structure Level 2),
VMS also provides a disk file structure (called Files-11 Structure Level
1) that is compatible with RSX Systems.  This provides for easy cross
migration of code and data. Both file structures are available to programs
running in either compatibility or native mode. However, not all features
of Files-11 Structure Level 2 are available to programs running in
compatibility mode. 

Note:  Files-11 Structure Level 1 (ODS-1) disks cannot be shared between
       nodes in a cluster. 

VAX-11 RSX supports general access to magnetic tape volumes.  In addition,
tapes created on an RSX system by BRU, DSC, FLX, PIP, and RMS BCK can all be
read on VAX-11 RSX by corresponding utilities. Similarly, it is possible to
create tapes on VAX-11 RSX to be read on an RSX system. 

Intersystem Facilities

VAX-11 RSX includes support for the RSX Data Terminal Emulator (DTE) and File
Transfer (MFT) utilities.  These utilities provide for two-way file transfer
to and from RSX family systems and other VMS Systems which are running
VAX-11 RSX.  Files of any type or size can be transferred via a serial line
in either direction from one system to the other in this manner. The file
transfer can be initiated from either system using the DTE utility
available on that system. 

DECnet is not available to RSX programs executing under VAX-11 RSX with one
exception: applications written to use RMS-11, Version 2.0 will have full
access to DECnet.
