PRODUCT NAME:  IXV11/VMS Driver, Version 2.0                  SPD 28.28.01


DESCRIPTION

The IXV11/VMS Driver allows programs written in any language supporting the
MicroVAX/VMS $QIO System Service to communicate with user devices connected
to the IXV11/IXV1S modules. 

The IXV11/IXV1S Module Family is a group of industrial digital input/output,
analogue input/output, and counter interfaces for DIGITAL's Q-bus machines. 

These interfaces are:
    
^  Digital Input Module supported:
   
   IDV11-A/  16-bit opto-coupler                      (M5026)
   IDV1S-A   isolated digital input                   (M5026-P0)
    
^  Digital Output Modules supported:
    
   IDV11-B/  16-bit opto-coupler                      (M6029)
   IDV1S-B   isolated digital output                  (M6029-P0)
   IDV11-C/  16-bit relay output                      (M8005)
   IDV1S-C   16-bit relay output                      (M8005-P0)

^  Analog Input Modules supported:
    
   IAV11-A/  Isolated multi-channel                   (A410) 
   IAV1S-A   A/D converter                            (A410-P0)
   IAV11-AA/ 16 channel A/D converter                 (A410-YA)
   IAV1S-AA                                           (A410-PA)

   IAV11-C/  16 channel flying capacity               (A029)
   IAV1S-C   multiplexer for IAV11-A/IAV11-AA         (A029-P0)
   IAV11-CA/ 16 channel semiconductor                 (A029-YA)
   IAV1S-CA  multiplexer for IAV11-A/IAV11-AA         (A029-PA)
    
^  Analog Output Module supported:
    
   IAV11-B/  4 channel group                          (A6007)
   IAV1S-B   isolated D/A converter                   (A6007-P0)

^  Counter Module supported:
    
   IDV11-D/  Opto-coupler isolated                    (M7197) 
   IDV1S-D   5 channel counter                        (M7197-P0)

The following driver software functionality is available for control of the
IXV1x interfaces.  The driver allows any of the IXV1x interfaces to be either
allocated by a single process or shared between several processes. 

^  Digital Input/Output requests support the following modes of operation:

   -  Read data from one or several IDV1x-A modules
   -  Write data to one or several IDV1x-B or IDV1x-C modules
   -  Read or write fractions of a 16 bit value
   -  Interrupts can be handled in a user process by AST routines

^  Analog Input/Output requests support the following modes of operation:

   -  Read data from one or several (up to 128 different) channels on 
      IAV1x-A, -AA and IAV1x-C, -CA modules
   -  Write data to one or several (up to 4 different) channels on IAV1x-B 
      modules
   -  Automatic gain selection can be enabled
   -  Multiple reads on one channel can be initiated with one request
   -  Conversion can be started internally or externally

Although the number of different channels is limited to 128, it is possible
to read each channel more than once with one request.  Therefore the actual
number of values which can be read is limited only by the length of the
control buffer. 

^  The Counter functions support the following modes of operation:

   -  Start or stop of one or more (up to 5) counter channels simultaneously 
      on one IDV1x-D module
   -  Counting upwards or downwards may be selected per channel
   -  Every channel may be preset with an initial value
   -  A counter overflow and/or underflow may be handled in an user AST 
      routine
   -  Count of external events controlled by internal or external start signal
   -  Count of selectable internal time intervals upon external control 
      signal (time measurements)
   -  Concatenating consecutive counter channels
