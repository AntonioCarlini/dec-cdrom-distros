PRODUCT NAME:  VAX Distributed Queuing Service, Version 1.1    SPD 28.80.01

DESCRIPTION

The standard VMS queue system enables users to use the VMS PRINT command to 
print files on output devices that are attached to their local VMS node. 

The VAX Distributed Queuing Service (DQS) uses DECnet to extend the standard 
VMS queue system to enable users to:

^ Print jobs on printers connected to systems other
  than their own.

^ Show the status of jobs on those systems.

^ Cancel their jobs from those systems.

^ Change the specifications of their jobs on those
  systems.

Any node where a print request originates is called a client. Any node with 
an attached printer that performs the printing is called a server. Any node
with DQS software can be configured to operate as only a client or as both 
a client and a server. DQS does not limit the number of client or server 
nodes or queues. The system manager creates the queues and establishes the 
correspondence between client queues and queues on server nodes. A queue on 
a server node can accept jobs from queues on multiple client nodes.

DQS provides a high degree of compatibility with the corresponding single node 
commands and features of VMS.

Features 

The following is a summary of features available in the VAX Distributed 
Queuing Service software:

^ Provides an easy means of printing from systems that do not have 
  printers.

^ Provides completely transparent support for the following qualifiers 
  of the VMS PRINT command:

  /BACKUP, /BEFORE, /BURST, /BY__OWNER, /CONFIRM,

  /CHARACTERISTICS, /COPIES, /CREATED, /DEVICE,

  /EXCLUDE, /EXPIRED, /FEED, /FLAG, /IDENTIFY, /JOB_

  COUNT, /LOWERCASE, /MODIFIED, /NAME, /NOTE, /QUEUE,

  /REMOTE, /RESTART, /PAGES, /PASSALL, /SETUP,

  /SINCE, /SPACE, /TRAILER, and /USER.

All other VMS PRINT qualifiers are supported, with slight differences that 
reflect the distributed environment of DQS.

^ DQS allows multiple VMS systems to share expensive or unique printers.

^ If the DQS server is not accessible when a print command is issued, 
  DQS will attempt to transfer the job for printing after the server again 
  becomes available.

^ If a printer becomes unavailable, the corresponding DQS server queue can 
  be configured to direct print jobs to a different DQS server queue (i.e., 
  daisy-chaining)

^ DQS can send notification to the user after a print job has been completed.

^ DQS does not limit the user's choice of printing equipment as it can work 
  with standard DIGITAL symbionts and most user written or user modified
  symbionts.

^ DQS can be used in any DECnet environment. Both Local Area Networks and 
  Wide Area Networks are supported.

^ Additional queues can be added and queue attributes changed without 
  reinstalling DQS.

^ Additional DQS nodes can be added to an existing network of DQS nodes 
  without reinstalling the software on the existing nodes.

^ DQS can be configured to limit access to servers.

^ DQS can be configured to keep records of use.

^ The DQS commands can be used on non-DQS queues.
