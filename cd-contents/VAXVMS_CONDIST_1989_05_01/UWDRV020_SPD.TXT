PRODUCT NAME:  KMV1A MicroVAX Driver, Version 2.0                SPD 28.23.02 
               (Formerly KMV1A MicroVMS Driver)

DESCRIPTION
  
The KMV1A MicroVAX Driver provides a mechanism for communication between a
MicroVAX host and the KMV1A Programmable Communications Controller. The
driver controls this communication by providing an interface between MicroVAX
application programs and microcode being executed in the KMV1A Controller's
microprocessor. The communication includes data transfer; and the transfer of
command, control, and status information to and from the KMV1A Controller.
The driver also provides the mechanism to load microcode from the MicroVAX
host into the KMV1A Controller, and to initialize the microcode. 
  
The KMV1A MicroVAX Driver software product consists of three major
components: the KMV1A driver, an installation verification program, and a
demonstration program. 

Features
  
The KMV1A driver provides the following features:
  
^  Loading of microcode into the KMV1A Controller. (For X.25 applications, 
   microcode is available from DIGITAL as part of an optional software 
   product described below. For other applications, custom microcode is 
   developed by the customer.)
  
^  Initialization of KMV1A microcode
  
^  Capability to up-line dump the memory contents of the KMV1A Controller RAM 
   to host memory
  
^  QIO based interface for communication between the MicroVAX host and KMV1A 
   Controller
  
^  Memory mapped control of host area for DMA data transfer to and from the 
   KMV1A Controller
  
^  Full duplex data transmission between the host and the KMV1A Controller 
   at up to 64K bps. Note that the KMV1A microcode may limit throughput to 
   less than 64K bps in certain applications.  For example, the microcode 
   included in the KMV1A MicroVAX X.25 Link Level product supports full 
   duplex data transmission at up to 19.2K bps
  
^  Host error logging of detected KMV1A errors
  
The installation verification program verifies that the KMV1A MicroVAX Driver
has been installed properly. The program performs basic driver functions and
verifies that files are resident in the correct locations. The installation
verification program also verifies that the KMV1A 

Controller is functioning at a basic level by transmitting data to and from 
the KMV1A Controller. 
  
The host demonstration program is a compilable FORTRAN program which provides
an example of basic commands which would be used by MicroVAX application
programs to interface to the KMV1A Controller through the KMV1A driver. The
demonstration program loads and initializes test KMV1A microcode, and then
performs several transmit and receive commands. 
  
The demonstration program is included in this software product for
instructional purposes only; it is meant to serve as an example of effective
use of the KMV1A driver. DIGITAL does not provide the demonstration program
for use, as is, by customers in functional host communication applications.
DIGITAL will not support such use of the demonstration program. 

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS *
  
MicroVAX Configuration as specified in the System Support Addendum 
(SSA 28.23.02-x).

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS *

VMS Operating System

OPTIONAL SOFTWARE

There are two optional software products which are dependent on the 
KMV1A MicroVAX Driver 

^ KMV1A MicroVAX Driver and Development Tools (Refer to SPD 28.26.xx)

^ KMV1A MicroVAX Driver and X.25 Line Level Software (Refer to SPD 
  28.27.xx)

Customers with a KMV1A Programmable Communications Controller and the 
KMV1A MicroVAX Driver may choose between the Driver and Tools and 
Driver and X.25 software products depending upon their intended 
communications application.

The KMV1A MicroVAX Driver and Development Tools software product is 
intended for customers that plan to develop custom communication 
protocol applications.  The Driver and Tools software product provides 
utilities which facilitate the customer's development of communication 
protocol microcode to run on the microprocessor of the KMV1A 
Programmable Communications Controller.

The KMV1A MicroVAX Driver and X.25 Link Level Software product is 
intended for customers with X.25 based communication protocol 
applications.  The Driver and X.25 product includes microcode which is 
down-line loaded into the KMV1A microprocessor.

The microcode can be configured at the user's option to execute the 
data link level of the X.25 protocol, or to provide HDLC framing 
capability.  The Driver and X.25 product conforms to the 1980 CCITT 
X.25 Recommendation pertaining to Link Access Procedure (LAP-B).

* Refer to the System Support Addendum for availabilty and required versions 
  of Prerequisite/Optional software (SSA 28.23.02-x).
