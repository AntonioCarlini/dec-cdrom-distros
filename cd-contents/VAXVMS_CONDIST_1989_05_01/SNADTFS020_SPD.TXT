PRODUCT NAME: DECnet/SNA Data Transfer Facility         SPD 27.85.01
              Version 2.0

DESCRIPTION

DECnet/SNA Data Transfer Facility (DTF) is a layered software product
that provides data transfer capabilities between an IBM (R) MVS system
in a Systems Network Architecture (SNA) environment and one or more
DIGITAL nodes in a DECnet network.  

DIGITAL nodes include VMS systems running DECnet-VAX, ULTRIX systems 
running DECnet-ULTRIX, and MS (TM)-DOS systems running DECnet-DOS.  DTF 
allows users to copy files bidirectionally while transparently maintaining 
the information content of the files. DTF also allows VMS users to access 
IBM (R) datasets on a record level basis either through the DIGITAL 
Command Language, RMS Programming Interface or through DATATRIEVE. Access 
between the cooperating DIGITAL and IBM (R) environments is via the 
DECnet/SNA Gateway or VMS/SNA software. There are three components to 
the product and each is described below.

DECnet/SNA Data Transfer Facility Server (VMS/DTF Server) 

The VMS/DTF server software is installed on a VAX system in the
DECnet network or on a VAX system running VMS/SNA and communicates
with the MVS/DTF software (see below).  The node that is running the
VMS/DTF Server software is referred to as the VMS/DTF Server node. 
Data translation that occurs during the transfer is done by the
server. VAX Common Data Dictionary (CDD) is required on the VMS/DTF
Server node for the translation of data types other than ASCII to
EBCDIC. 

DECnet/SNA Data Transfer Facility Utilities (VMS/DTF Utilities) 

The VMS/DTF Utilities software is an OPTIONAL layered product that can
be installed on any VAX system that wants to use DTF to transfer
files using the recoverable copy feature.  It consists of a management
utility and a checkpoint/recovery utility.  The VMS/DTF Utilities
software communicates with the VMS/DTF Server software, not directly
with the DECnet/SNA Gateway or VMS/SNA Software. It is not necessary
to install the VMS/DTF Utilities software on the server node since 
these utilities are included in the VMS/DTF Server software package. 

DECnet/SNA MVS Data Transfer Facility (MVS/DTF) 

The MVS/DTF software consists of three parts: a VTAM application
program that controls the communications with the VMS/DTF Server nodes
for the purpose of transfering files, a TSO command processor, and an
ISPF dialog that are used to initiate tranfers from the IBM system. 

Features

The DTF product uses standard DIGITAL and IBM user interfaces in order 
to provide the DTF user a familiar working environment.  The VMS
user interface to the product is through the standard VMS file
manipulation utilities (e.g. COPY and TYPE), the Record Management
System (RMS) programming interface, an interface to the File
Transfer Checkpoint and Recovery Utility, or the DTF Management
Utility Interface. The ULTRIX user interface is through the standard 
ULTRIX Shell environment. The MS-DOS user interface is through the 
standard DECnet-DOS NFT command.  The IBM user interface to the product
is through the TSO DTF command and ISPF panels. A TSO command processor 
can also be invoked in a JES batch job.

A complete file can be transferred from a DIGITAL system to an IBM MVS
system and vice versa.  The file transfer can be initiated from the
DIGITAL system or the IBM MVS system.  The transfer can be done
interactively or in batch. 

DTF supports IBM VSAM and non-VSAM files.  DTF can be used to create,
read and write VSAM and non-VSAM file types. 

^ Supported VSAM file types include entry-sequenced data sets (ESDS), 
  relative record data sets (RRDS), and key sequenced data sets (KSDS).
  Disk resident files are supported and can be transferred to and from
  Record Management System indexed sequential files.

^ Supported non-VSAM file types are those with the physical sequential 
  data set organization. This includes normal sequential files as well 
  as partitioned data set members. Both disk resident and tape resident 
  files are supported and can be transferred to and from Record Management 
  System sequential files. 

A copy operation performed by the VMS system with the TRANSFER/DTF 
command supports recoverable file transfer for non-VSAM file types.  If
communications fail or a system goes down during a copy operation, the
checkpoint and recovery mechanism resumes copying from the last
checkpoint when communications are reestablished or when the system
comes back up.  A copy operation performed from the MVS system can
utilize an automatic retry of a failed request through the use of
TSO/E and CLIST. 

DTF allows data translation from DMCS (DIGITAL Multinational Character
Set, a superset of ASCII) to EBCDIC on a record-by-record basis and
vice versa. To translate binary, integer, floating point, packed
decimal, and numeric strings, the VAX Common Data Dictionary is
required on the VMS/DTF Server Node.  The semantics of data in the
file is maintained across a file transfer. 

Datasets on the IBM system are only accessible to DIGITAL users that know
the valid access control.  MVS/DTF provides interfaces into the ACF2
and RACF security systems and a standard user exit for other security
mechanisms (such as Top Secret) through the System Authorization Facility
(SAF) interface. For DIGITAL systems, security is through the standard file
protection mechanism provided by the base operating system.

Security is also enhanced in both the DIGITAL and the MVS environments
through the use of a proxy database on the VMS/DTF Server node. VMS,
MS-DOS and ULTRIX users do not have to enter MVS passwords on the
command line.  In addition, MVS passwords will not be displayed in the
output of any command.  MVS users will be prompted for passwords in
non-display fields only.  VMS passwords will not be displayed by the
TSO LIST command. 

DTF/VTAM logs events which can be used for historical inquiry or for 
accounting usage.  Historical logging can be used to characterize the 
use of DTF/VTAM.  Such information is necessary for decisions 
involving operating hours, performance tuning and load analysis of the 
network and operating system.  Accounting logging allows VMS users of 
DTF/VTAM functions to be recorded along with the resources consumed 
during their operations.  The granularity of the information is 
sufficient to provide a bill back capability.  Implementation of the 
accounting and billing capability is handled with a user exit and can 
be customized on a per site basis.

DTF allows a VMS user record level access to most MVS data set types
via an RMS application, DCL commands, or Datatrieve.   The following DCL 
commands have been tested and work with DTF.  Note that some of the 
qualifiers associated with the DCL commands are subject to restrictions 
when used with DTF.

^ APPEND
^ CLOSE
^ CONVERT
^ COPY
^ CREATE
^ DELETE
^ DIFFERENCES
^ DIRECTORY
^ OPEN
^ READ
^ SEARCH
^ TYPE
^ WRITE

MS-DOS systems can initiate non-recoverable, bidirectional file
transfers between MVS systems and itself.  MS-DOS supports only stream
files, therefore all files copied to MS-DOS systems result as a stream
file.  All files copied from MS-DOS systems result as sequential data 
sets on the MVS system.  IBM initiated file transfers are supported 
with MS-DOS systems when the DECnet-DOS system is running the File 
Access Listener (FAL).  MS-DOS users can use the DECnet-DOS Network File 
Transfer to accomplish the following tasks: 

^ COPY files to/from MVS

^ APPEND to files on MVS

^ TYPE files that reside on MVS systems

^ DELETE files that reside on MVS systems

^ DIRECTORY listing of MVS files

ULTRIX systems can initiate non-recoverable, bidirectional file
transfers between MVS systems and itself.  ULTRIX only supports stream
files, therefore all files copied to ULTRIX systems result as a stream
file, including indexed files.  All files copied from ULTRIX systems
result as sequential files on the MVS system.  IBM intiated file
transfers are supported with ULTRIX systems. ULTRIX users can use the
following DECnet/ULTRIX commands with the same command syntax as DTF
VMS users: 

^ DCAT - Type the contents of MVS files
^ DCP - Initiate file transfers to/from MVS
^ DLS - Directory listing of MVS files
^ DRM - Delete MVS files

PREREQUISITE SUPPORT

A Network Profile and a DECnet Customer Support Plan (where
applicable) covering all intended VMS nodes that wish to access
the IBM MVS environment must be prepared jointly by DIGITAL and the
customer. 

For DTF to be DIGITAL supported, the customer must have a DIGITAL 
supported DECnet/SNA Gateway or VMS/SNA configuration. 

To have a DIGITAL supported DECnet/SNA Gateway configuration, purchase
of the Gateway Orientation/Installation Service is required in 
conjunction with the customer's first purchase of the
DECnet/SNA Gateway. 

For more information on DIGITAL's service offerings, please contact 
your local DIGITAL office.

INSTALLATION

Customer Responsibilities
