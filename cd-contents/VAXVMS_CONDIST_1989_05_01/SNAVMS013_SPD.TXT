PRODUCT NAME: VMS/SNA, Version 1.3                            SPD 27.01.04

DESCRIPTION

VMS/SNA is a layered software product that allows suitably configured VMS
systems the ability to directly participate in an IBM Systems Network
Architecture (SNA) networking environment. After installing the VMS/SNA
software and one or more DECnet/SNA Access Routines, users can perform
functions such as accessing IBM (r) application programs or other system
resources, act as a 3270 display station, exchange data files and documents
with an IBM Host, and implement distributed application programs that run
between the VMS and IBM systems. 

The functions provided by the VMS/SNA software will be comparable to those
provided by the DECnet/SNA Gateway product. Systems wishing access to the SNA
environment must be configured with the appropriate DECnet/SNA VMS Access
Routines. For additional information on which Access Routines are supported
with VMS/SNA, consult the table in the Optional Software section of this SPD.

Architecturally, a VAX system running VMS/SNA appears to the SNA network as a
Physical Unit Type 2 node, and is attached to the SNA network through a
synchronous communications device to an IBM 37xx Communications Controller.
The VMS/SNA software supports one communication line at speeds from 1.2K bps
to 64K bps, depending on the communications device being used. A maximum of
16 concurrent SNA logical unit sessions are supported. Both local and remote
connections are supported from VMS/SNA into the IBM SNA network, using
switched or leased lines in point-to-point or multi-point environments.  The
synchronous port on the DMB32 is used to support the VAXBI-based VAX systems.
NRZI is supported when using the DMB32, DST32 or DSV11 devices. 

Each device supports a different maximum line speed.  Refer to the following
table. 

Device                Maximum Line Speed

DMB32                 64K   bits/second (with V.35 modem interface)
DSV11                 64K   bits/second (with V.35 modem interface)

DPV11                 9.6K  bits/second
DST32                 19.2K bits/second

VMS/SNA Node Management Features

The SNA Node Management (SNANM) utility provides the human interface for the
DIGITAL System Manager to monitor, control, and troubleshoot VMS/SNA and its
IBM/SNA environment. All management functions pertaining to VMS/SNA are
performed on the VAX. The SNANM utility's commands allow you to display
information pertaining to the circuit status and counters, the line status,
and access names.  The circuit state can be set on or off. On-line help is
provided. 

Management of the VMS/SNA node should be viewed as part of the DIGITAL
environment while the management of the line connecting the MicroVMS system
to the IBM system is a joint responsibility of the IBM and DIGITAL system
managers. 

VMS/SNA Problem Isolation and Determination Tools

SNA Protocol Trace Utility (SNATRACE) is a problem determination tool that
provides frame level tracing of a circuit to help in debugging application
programs, as well as identifying system problems. A privileged user can run a
trace at the Physical Unit (PU) level, SDLC level, or session level.  The
trace feature is helpful in isolating errors for remedial action and for
debugging user-written SNA applications. 

The VMS/SNA Installation Verification Procedure (IVP), SNA_VP, is also useful
for problem isolation.  SNA_VP is run separately from any Access Routine, and
may be used to verify connection to specific IBM applications over specific
LU sessions.  In failure cases, SNA_VP displays an expanded error text that
attempts to diagnose the cause of failure.

INSTALLATION

Purchase of the VMS/SNA Orientation/Installation Service is REQUIRED in
conjunction with the customer's purchase of VMS/SNA software for the first
DIGITAL node connected to each IBM host in order for the VMS/SNA software to
be warranted and supported by DIGITAL. 

Only experienced customers should attempt installation of second or
subsequent nodes running the VMS/SNA software. 

Customer Responsibilities

Before installation of the software, the customer must:

^  Previously have installed all prerequisite hardware including terminals

^  Obtain, install, and demonstrate as operational any modems and other 
   equipment and facilities necessary to interface to DIGITAL's 
   communication equipment

^  Demonstrate equivalence of operation for modems other than Bell System 
   201C, 208A or 209A, AT&T 2596, 2556,  Dataphone II (2096A, Digital 2500, 
   or equivalent) type modems, or in Europe PTT approved modems

^  Have generated, to DIGITAL's satisfaction, any necessary IBM host software 
   that will be communicating with the VMS/SNA software

^  Have completed any additional requirements as described in the VMS/SNA 
   Orientation/Installation Service 

^  Make available for a reasonable period of time, as mutually agreed by 
   DIGITAL and the customer, all hardware, communication facilities, and 
   terminals that are to be used during installation

^  Be prepared to work with the DIGITAL and the IBM system manager in the 
   pre-installation activities outlined in the VMS/SNA 
   Orientation/Installation Service 

^  Be prepared to modify IBM component generation parameters to support the 
   VMS/SNA software 

Delays caused by any failure to meet these responsibilities will be charged
at DIGITAL's then prevailing rate for time and materials. 

Customer Installation

Only customers experienced with IBM Interconnect products should attempt
installation of second or subsequent nodes running the VMS/SNA software. Any
VMS/SNA software installations performed by customers are REQUIRED to be
CERTIFIED by DIGITAL prior to customer purchase of VMS/SNA DECsupport
Service, Basic Service or Self-Maintenance Service. CERTIFICATION is
performed by DIGITAL software specialists. For installations that conform to
the SPD and cannot be certified, the customer must purchase VMS/SNA
Orientation/Installation Service to be eligible for VMS/SNA DECsupport
Service, Basic Service or Self-Maintenance Service.
