PRODUCT NAME:  VAX PrintServer 40 Client Software, Version 2.1   SPD 27.67.02

DESCRIPTION

The PrintServer 40 Client Software is a layered product that enables suitably
configured VMS or MicroVMS systems within a DECnet Ethernet network to
access the PrintServer 40. 

The Client software consists of the following components:

^  A print symbiont to process print requests from one or more PrintServer 40 
   printer queues. 

^  The distribution software to transmit the request and associated data over 
   the Ethernet to the remote PrintServer 40 via DECnet.

^  Translators to convert ANSI Text and Sixel Graphics, ReGIS, and 
   Tektronix (TM) 4010/4014 files into the PostScript (TM) language.

^  A series of PostScript tools for creator software support. These include 
   a PostScript error handler, Font Metric Files and Font Encoding Vectors 
   for the ISO Latin Alphabet Number 1 (ISO 8859/1) and DIGITAL Multi-national
   Character Set for all of the built-in PostScript fonts.

The PrintServer 40 Client software must be installed on each system that will
be providing distributed printing services to its users via a PrintServer 40.

A system running the PrintServer 40 Client software can transmit print
requests to any PrintServer 40 on the network that is defined in its network
data base.  A maximum of 16 clients can simultaneously access a PrintServer
40 with only one client active at one time. 

Features

Print Symbiont

The /PARAMETERS qualifier in the PRINT command is used to pass print server
specific parameters to the print symbiont for processing.  These parameters
are as follows: 

^  Data_Type - Specifies the type of data in the print job being sent to the 
   printer.  If the Data_Type is other than PostScript, the print symbiont 
   will call one of the supplied translators (ANSI text and Sixel Graphics, 
   ReGIS, or Tektronix) to convert the data to PostScript prior to sending 
   it to the PrintServer 40.

^  Input_Tray - Selects the printer input tray that will supply the paper or 
   media for this job.

^  Output_Tray - Selects the printer output tray where the printed output 
   will be deposited.

^  Messages - Specifies the disposition of messages generated by the print 
   job.
        
^  Page_Orientation - Specifies the orientation of printed output on the 
   page (portrait or landscape).  This parameter is ignored when Data_Type 
   is PostScript unless Number_Up is specified.

^  Page_Size - Specifies the size of the logical pages being printed. This 
   parameter is ignored if Data_Type is PostScript or ANSI.
        
^  Sheet_Size - Specifies the physical size of the sheets to be printed. This 
   parameter will cause the appropriate input tray to be selected.
        
^  Sheet_Count - Specifies the number of times each sheet is to be printed 
   at the PrintServer 40.
        
^  Page_Limit - Specifies the first and last logical pages to be printed 
   for the job.

^  Layup_Definition - Specifies the name of a file that contains all of 
   the page layup features (Borders, Margins, Margin Altenation, Pages 
   per Sheet, First Page, Page Order and Page Grid) except Number_Up.

^  Number_Up - Specifies the maximum number of pages that can be printed
   on a sheet.

The print symbiont also supplies the following accounting information for 
each print job:  sheets of paper printed, Number of RMS Gets to all the user's
files in the print job and Number of QIO Writes over the network to the print 
server.

Translators  

Translator software allows you to print documents on the PrintServer 40 with
graphic protocols other than PostScript, the native language of the
PrintServer 40, by translating the designated protocol into PostScript. The
translators are invoked by the print symbiont at print time through the
/PARAMETERS switch of the PRINT command or by submission to a translator
specific queue. 
  
The translators provided convert the following data types into PostScript: 
  
^  ANSI text and Sixel graphics compatible with the LN03 excluding support 
   for font cartridges 
  
^  ReGIS compatible with the VT240  

^  Tektronix 4010/4014 compatible with VT240

PostScript is a device-independent, page description language that has the
ability to describe the appearance of text, images, and graphic material on
the printed  page. 
    
PostScript Tools

The tools consist of the following:
  
A PostScript error handler which prints the last partial page of output as
well as information to help identify the error.  This information includes
the error name, the PostScript operator that encountered the error, the
operand stack, and the graphics state of the machine at the time of the
error. 

A series of ASCII-encoded Font Metric Files that contain information
necessary for application programs to format text.  The Font Metric Files
consist of four sections that describe different general properties of a
font.  These sections include a global section that pertains to the font as a
whole; a character metrics section that consists of information such as
character widths;  a kerning data section that consists of information
regarding different types of kerning;  and a composite character section
containing information for forming character composites such as accented
letters.  The kerning section and composite character sections are optional
and may not be present for a given font. 

Font Encoding vectors for the ISO Latin Alphabet Number 1 (ISO 8859/1) and
DIGITAL Multinational Character Set are provided for all of the built-in
fonts.
