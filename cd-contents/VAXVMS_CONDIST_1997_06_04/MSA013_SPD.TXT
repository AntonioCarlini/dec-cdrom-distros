 PRODUCT NAME:  PATHWORKS V1.3 for OpenVMS (Macintosh)  SPD 35.09.03

 1  DESCRIPTION

 PATHWORKS[TM] V1.3 for OpenVMS[TM] (Macintosh[R]) is a member of the
 PATHWORKS family of software products that provides Macintosh network-
 ing and network operating systems (NOS) integration in local and wide
 area networks. PATHWORKS integrates the broadest set of PCs, Macin-
 tosh's servers, NOSs, network transports, and protocols and provides
 the foundation for client-server applications and corporate informa-
 tion exchanges.
 PATHWORKS provides a framework for integrating personal computers into
 an organization's total information system so that different types of
 users can share information, large system resources, and network ser-
 vices across the entire organization.

 PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Macintosh) allows VAX[TM] and Alpha computers
 running the OpenVMS operating system to offer file, print, and mail
 to Macintosh clients. By using a VAX or Alpha server system, Macin-
 tosh users can share applications, data, printers, and resources, ac-
 cess information from remote systems on the network, and apply that
 information in Macintosh applications. This product is described in
 the Software Product Description.

 PATHWORKS for Macintosh - Macintosh software that allows Macintosh clients
 to access file, print, and mail on OpenVMS, or file and print services
 on RISC/ULTRIX[TM] systems. This software also includes applications
 for terminal emulation, X display services, TCP/IP utilities, client
 front end management, DECnet[TM], and mail. This product is used in
 conjunction with PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Macintosh) and is required for
 Macintosh client access to these OpenVMS-based services (SPD 31.53.xx).
 This product is used in conjunction with DEC OSF/1[R] Alpha or Pacer[R]
 for ULTRIX and is required for Macintosh client access to RISC/UNIX[R]
 /ULTRIX-based services.

 o  AppleTalk-to-DECnet transport gateway


 Server Software

 PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Macintosh) provides the Macintosh user with the
 following features of the server software:

 o  DECshare File Services - The Macintosh user is provided with ac-
    cess to remote OpenVMS file systems as a transparent extension of
    the client's local disk facilities. Macintosh files are stored on
    the VAX and Alpha systems and accessed as if they were stored on
    the user's local disk. DECshare file services are based on the Ap-
    pleTalk for OpenVMS (V3.2) network transport and are compliant with
    the Apple[R] Filing Protocol (AFP), Version 2.1.

    DECshare file services assign the Macintosh type and creator at-
    tributes to files that were not created on a Macintosh. The cre-
    ator and type determine the icon that is displayed on the Macin-
    tosh desktop. When a Macintosh user selects a file that was not cre-
    ated using the Macintosh, DECshare assigns a type and creator based
    on the file's extension through a lookup table. This table may be
    modified to tailor the server to site-specific needs.

    Each Macintosh file stored on the file server is stored as an Open-
    VMS file in RMS Sequential file format. These Macintosh files are
    accessible to OpenVMS users and applications that can interpret the
    content and organization of a file written by a Macintosh appli-
    cation.

    The file server can read all RMS file types that can be read se-
    quentially, allowing Macintosh applications to read files written
    by an OpenVMS application. Each read issued by the Macintosh ap-
    plication results in the presentation to the application of the next
    n bytes contained sequentially in the file.

    AFP byte-range locking is supported for Macintosh applications ac-
    cessing files provided through the file service.

    System administrators can create file services that appear in any
    one of the local AppleTalk zones which provides flexibility in your
    environment. System administrators can also limit the number of con-
    nections to a file server volume and set a timeout value for in-
    active connections to a file server. The file server can detect unau-
    thorized intrusions using the OpenVMS Intrusion database.

 o  DECshare Print Services - Remote printers appear to the Macintosh
    user as a transparent extension of the client's local facilities.
    Macintosh users can access OpenVMS print queues to print to both
    Apple LaserWriter[R] and Digital PostScript[R] printers. The Ap-
    ple LaserWriter can be accessable to VMS users via a LocalTalk[R]-
    to-Ethernet router, a direct Ethernet connection (for those Laser-
    Writer printers that support this), a terminal server (LAT) port,
    or directly connected to a serial port on the server system.

                                  2

 

    The system administrator assigns a service name to the print queue.
    The Macintosh users select the printer from the Chooser as they do
    local printers. Then the printer I/O is directed to the defined and
    selected DECshare print service.

    DECshare print services include support for the DECshare Receiver,
    which handles print requests from the Macintosh. The Receiver stores
    the PostScript data it receives from the Macintosh in a temporary
    OpenVMS file before sending the data to the OpenVMS print queuing
    system. System administrators can choose to disable the Receiver
    so thatMacintosh users cannot print to a specific LaserWriter. Sys-
    tem administrators can also hide a LaserWriter from the Chooser,
    so that users who want to print to a specific printer are required
    to print through the DECshare print service.

    DECshare print services also support the DECshare print symbiont,
    which transfers data from VAX and Alpha systems to an Apple Laser-
    Writer printer. The DECshare symbiont also converts an ASCII file
    submitted by an OpenVMS user to PostScript data before transfer-
    ring the data to the printer. The symbiont does not support full
    ANSI conversion. DECshare uses the DECprint Printing Services to
    transfer data to a Digital PostScript printer.

    The MSA$MANAGER utility is used to create print services. Print queues
    for Digital's printers must be previously defined on the OpenVMS
    system. LaserWriter queues using the DECshare symbiont are created
    by the MSA$MANAGER utility.

 o  Server Management and Control - When a server offers a file resource
    for use, the system administrator can associate an Access Control
    List, which specifies privileges assigned to users.

    While the software may be running on more than one node of a VM-
    Scluster[TM], each Macintosh Volume served can only be served from
    a single file server in the cluster. As a result, there is no clus-
    ter fail-over of a served volume.

    An administrator's utility (MSA$MANAGER) is provided to allow the
    system administrator to add and remove services, and show resources.
    The system administrator can also manage a remote server using the
    SET REMOTE command.

    A second administrator's utility (ATK$MANAGER) is provided to al-
    low the system administrator to set up and maintain AppleTalk for
    OpenVMS and the AppleTalk/DECnet transport gateway.

 o  PATHWORKS Mail SERVER- The mail server included in PATHWORKS for
    OpenVMS (Macintosh) provides Macintosh and PC clients with the abil-
    ity to send and receive electronic mail messages. A mail account
    must be established on the OpenVMS server for each client, unless
    an account already exists. Mail can be sent to this account by other
    Macintosh clients as well as users of any mail system that can com-
    municate with OpenVMS mail software.The mail server then routes mes-
    sages to the appropriate client when the client logs in to the server.

                                  3

 

    The PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Macintosh) mail server provides the Mac-
    intosh user with folders, distribution lists, and delivery capa-
    bilities. Notification of new messages occurs when the Macintosh
    user logs in to a network session and the PATHWORKS Listener is run-
    ning on the client.


 Network Connectivity

 AppleTalk for OpenVMS Version 3.2 is an implementation of Apple's Ap-
 pleTalk Networking protocols and interface libraries for OpenVMS sys-
 tems. AppleTalk for OpenVMS allows an OpenVMS system to communicate
 with an AppleTalk network. The DECshare file and print services use
 this network transport. The AppleTalk for OpenVMS protocol stack in-
 cludes support for the following protocols: ADSP, AELAP, AARP, AEP,
 NBP, ZIP, RTMP (full set), ATP, ASP (server only), PAP (client and server).
 The ASP client and the AFP protocols are not implemented in the Ap-
 pleTalk for OpenVMS protocol stack.

 AppleTalk for OpenVMS, Version 3.2 supports AppleTalk Phase 2 proto-
 cols. Only Macintosh computers connected to Phase 2 networks can ac-
 cess services using AppleTalk for OpenVMS.

 AppleTalk for OpenVMS also allows routing, or tunneling, through DEC-
 net. When tunneling, AppleTalk packets are encapsulated in DECnet pack-
 ets so that the AppleTalk network can be extended, and Macintosh users
 can access remote AppleTalk networks and servers as if they were lo-
 cal.

 The router provides AppleTalk Internet routing, zone management, rout-
 ing table maintenance, and name-binding broadcast request handling.
 When routing, or tunneling, datalink speeds below 56 kilobits/second
 are not recommended and speeds below 19.2 kilobits/second are not sup-
 ported. The datalink speed must be capable of handling DECnet and Ap-
 pleTalk traffic (including all protocol overhead) without congestion.
 That is, there must be sufficient bandwidth to maintain reliable com-
 munications.

 AppleTalk/DECnet Gateway, which is OpenVMS software, connects a Mac-
 intosh with a DECnet service on any DECnet node. As a result, Macin-
 tosh users who have only AppleTalk connectivity but no DECnet resi-
 dent software can participate in task-to-task applications. Macintosh
 applications that are written to take advantage of the AppleTalk/DECnet
 gateway can participate in AppleTalk/DECnet task-to-task communica-
 tions. The gateway provides bi-directional conversion between AppleTalk
 ADSP and DECnet NSP protocols. The gateway supports up to 1000 con-
 nections from client applications- provided that sufficient system CPU
 and memory resources are available. Significant system tuning will be
 necessary if the number of sessions is raised appreciably from the de-
 fault of 32.

 Restrictions and Limitations



                                  4

 

 Because PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Macintosh) uses AppleTalk Phase 2 pro-
 tocols, services provided by PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Macintosh) servers
 will only be accessible to Macintoshes that are connected to Phase 2
 networks. Phase 1 networks can co-exist with Phase 2, provided that
 Phase 1 to Phase 2 transition router is suitably placed somewhere in
 the network. Use of Phase 1 protocols anywhere in the network is not
 recommended due to the increased network load.

 While AFP byte range locking is supported among Macintosh clients, only
 file locking is supported with other types of clients (DOS and OS/2)[R].

 For a serially connected LaserWriter, the following characters in font
 families are not available: Ctrl-C, Ctrl-D, Ctrl-Q, Ctrl-S, Ctrl-T.
 These characters are used by the PostScript interpreter for handshak-
 ing purposes. Attempts to print these characters result in a space char-
 acter. This restriction does not apply to AppleTalk printers directly
 connected on Ethernet or LocalTalk.

 The PATHWORKS Mail server restricts folder names to 39 characters. If
 a user creates a folder with more than 39 characters in the name, the
 name is truncated after the 39th character.

 The DECshare implementation of AFP V2.1 does not support Blank Access
 Privileges or the AFP Cat Search functions.
