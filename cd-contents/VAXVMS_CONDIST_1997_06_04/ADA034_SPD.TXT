PRODUCT NAME:  DEC Ada Version 3.4 for OpenVMS VAX Systems      SPD
26.60.16

DESCRIPTION

This Software Product Description includes the following two products:

o  DEC Ada Version 3.4 for OpenVMS VAX Systems

o  DEC Ada Version 3.4 Professional Development
   Option for OpenVMS VAX Systems

DEC Ada for OpenVMS VAX is the Digital Equipment Corporation validated
implementation of the full ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A-1983 Ada Language. As
a result of meeting the ANSI standard, DEC Ada also conforms to the
Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS-119). The DEC Ada com-
piler runs on the OpenVMS operating system and generates optimized,
shareable, and position-independent code.

As a native mode OpenVMS language, DEC Ada is integrated into the Open-
VMS common language environment. All OpenVMS system services and util-
ities are available to programs written in DEC Ada. DEC Ada supports
the OpenVMS Record Management Services (RMS) sequential, relative, and
indexed file organizations and associated access methods. DEC Ada pro-
grams can invoke modules written in other OpenVMS languages. Addition-
ally, programs written in other languages can invoke DEC Ada modules.

Ada is a powerful, general-purpose language that supports many mod-
ern programming practices. The language was designed as the result of
a competition sponsored by the United States Department of Defense.
The purpose of the competition was to define a language suitable for
programming-embedded computer systems. Among the requirements for the

                                                         April 1997

language were features that would reduce software costs by increas-
ing maintainability, evolvability, reliability, and portability.

Ada provides a modular structure for programs by allowing separate com-
pilation of program units, as well as providing strong typing, task-
ing, exception handling, and other standard language features that must
be supported across implementations. Ada provides a number of features
from general systems to real-time applications.

Ada Language Features

o  Strong Typing - An object (variable) of a given type may take on
   only those values that are appropriate to that type, and only cer-
   tain predefined operations may be performed on data of that type.
   Because type checking is done at compile time, strong typing en-
   sures that any errors associated with incorrect data types are de-
   tected at compile time.

o  Data Abstraction - Also known as information hiding, data abstrac-
   tion hides implementation details while providing users with mech-
   anisms for using the implementation. Abstraction allows the user
   to focus on important characteristics while ignoring underlying de-
   tails. Ada provides various levels of abstraction through features
   such as private data types and packages.

o  Concurrent Processing - For many applications, it is important that
   a program be conceived of as a number of parallel, rather than se-
   rial activities. Most high-order languages provide little or no sup-
   port for handling such parallel or concurrent activities. They rely
   on facilities of the host operating system. Ada uses tasks to al-
   low parallel activities to be programmed directly within the lan-
   guage.

o  Separate Compilation - Ada's separate compilation feature allows
   a programmer to divide a large program into compilation units that
   may be compiled at different times. When a unit is compiled, the
   Ada program library manager records information about that unit and
   other related units. This feature is unlike separate compilation
   features in other languages where little information about sepa-
   rately compiled modules is maintained.

                                 2

 

o  Generic Definitions - A generic unit is a template from which spe-
   cific instances can be made at compile time. In many cases, the logic
   of an algorithm or a set of operations is independent of the spe-
   cific type of the values being manipulated. However, in a strongly
   typed language such as Ada, all types must be defined at compile
   time. Generic definitions let the user define a general algorithm
   or set of related operations and then create a specific instance
   of that algorithm or set of operations for each type to which the
   algorithm or operations must apply.

o  Exception Handling - In many operations, especially embedded com-
   puter systems, it is critical that a system be able to recover quickly
   and efficiently from error conditions. Ada provides the ability to
   raise and handle exceptions. It includes predefined exceptions and
   also permits the user to define exceptions. When an exception oc-
   curs in an Ada program, normal processing is abandoned and control
   passes to the exception handler.

DEC Ada Components and Special System-Related Features:

o  Ada compiler fully conforming to ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A-1983. For de-
   tails see the DEC Ada Language Reference Manual.

o  Ada program library manager that provides support for programming
   teams through:

   -  Program libraries that can be shared by many programmers

   -  A powerful search list model for program libraries. This per-
      mits the following:

      *  The relationships among program libraries can be changed eas-
         ily.

      *  Individual programmers can establish different views of pro-
         gram library relationships.

   -  Automatic recompilation of obsolete compilation units

   -  The ability to share compiled Ada code either by reference or
      copy

                                 3

 

o  Strongly-typed DEC Ada bindings that provide interfaces for the fol-
   lowing versions of X Window Systems[TM] and Motif® routines:

   -  X Window System Version 11R4 and
      Motif Version 1.1.3

   -  X Window System Version 11R5 and
      Motif Version 1.2

o  Implementation of AI-00866, which permits an 8-bit character set
   based on ISO standard 8859/1 (commonly known as Latin-1).

o  Availability of a portability command that causes a portability sum-
   mary report to be included with the compilation listing file. The
   report indicates the use of potentially nonportable features and
   constructs.

o  Support for the ISO Math Library packages
   GENERIC_PRIMITIVE_FUNCTIONS and
   GENERIC_ELEMENTARY_FUNCTIONS.

o  Debugging capability provided through the
   OpenVMS debugger. High-level, fully symbolic debugging including
   support for debugging tasking programs, packages and mixed DEC Ada
   and non-Ada code.

o  Integration with OpenVMS VAX Operating System including:

   -  Conformance to the OpenVMS VAX Calling Standard, which allows
      Ada code to call and be called by code written in other languages,
      as well as to call OpenVMS system services and the OpenVMS VAX
      Run-Time Library

   -  The ability to call Open Record Management Services (RMS) rou-
      tines directly

   -  Full access to relative and indexed file capabilities

   -  The ability to handle exceptions from non-Ada code and gener-
      ate exceptions to be handled by non-Ada code

   -  The ability to handle OpenVMS asynchronous system traps (ASTs)

                                 4

 

   -  The ability to link with shared images and use shared global sec-
      tions

   -  The ability to share data with non-Ada code through global vari-
      ables and psects (common blocks)

o  System-dependent facilities - Different systems vary in such char-
   acteristics as the size of storage units, memory size, and the small-
   est and largest integer values supported. DEC Ada provides the pre-
   defined package SYSTEM to define system-related constants and to
   represent system-dependent information.

o  DEC Ada provides representation clauses that allow the user to tai-
   lor the representation of data to suit a particular system. DEC Ada
   provides:

   -  Length clauses that specify the amount of storage associated with
      a type

   -  Enumeration representation clauses that specify the internal codes
      for the literals of enumeration types

   -  Record representation clauses that specify the layout of a record
      type, such as the order, position, and size of record components

   -  Address clauses that specify required addresses in storage for
      objects, imported subprograms, or single entries

o  DEC Ada provides a number of pragmas (compiler directives) that al-
   low various system-related parameters to be set and changed and con-
   trol mixed-language programming.

o  Comprehensive diagnostic messages with references to the DEC Ada
   Language Reference Manual. This feature is directed at helping the
   new DEC Ada user.

DEC Ada Professional Development Option for OpenVMS VAX Systems

The DEC Ada Professional Development Option is a separately licensed
option that is available with DEC Ada on OpenVMS VAX Systems. The DEC
Ada Professional Development Option includes the following capabil-
ities:

o  Smart Recompilation - This feature can significantly reduce the num-
   ber of recompilations that are needed to rebuild a DEC Ada program
   after some compilation units change. Smart recompilation enables
   the compiler to propagate changes quickly through a system, elim-
   inating up to 100% of the usual recompilations.

o  Program Library File-Block Caching - This feature uses an in-memory
   cache of file blocks to minimize the actual amount of disk input-
   output that must be performed. As a result, the elapsed time for
   compilations is significantly reduced.

o  Multilevel Program Library Directory Structure - This feature pro-
   vides a more efficient program library directory structure to im-
   prove the performance of access to large program libraries.

The DEC Ada Professional Development Option is designed so that it is
compatible with libraries that are created without the DEC Ada Pro-
fessional Development Option and libraries created with a previous ver-
sion of DEC Ada. Once a program library is created, DEC Ada program-
mers do not need to change any of their development procedures to ben-
efit from the DEC Ada Professional Development Option.
