DEC Network Integration Server Software, Version 4.0

SPD 36.05.10

DESCRIPTION

The DEC Network Integration Server (DECNIS) 500/600 product provides
multiprotocol routing, bridging, and X.25 gateway services to host systems
on local area networks (LANs) connected to the DECNIS or to host systems
connected to the DECNIS over wide area network (WAN) connections. The
DECNIS 500/600 software runs on any DECNIS 500 or 600 hardware unit.

Overview

The DECNIS software provides a routing service for:

   * TCP/IP hosts

   * DECnet Phase IV nodes

   * DECnet/OSI Phase V nodes

   * OSI-compatible systems

   * Novell[R] NetWare[R] nodes

   * AppleTalk[R] nodes

Multiprotocol routing of IP, DECnet, and OSI is implemented using the
Integrated Intermediate System to Intermediate System (Integrated ISIS)
routing protocol. Routing of IP is also supported using Open Shortest Path
First (OSPF), Routing Information Protocol (RIP), Border Gateway Protocol 4
(BGP-4), and Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP). Routing of Novell NetWare and
AppleTalk is implemented on the LAN using native protocols and over the WAN
using encapsulation within IP.

The DECNIS software supports bridging of protocols that can not be routed.
Both local bridging between LANs connected to the same DECNIS unit, and
remote bridging between two DECNIS units connected over WAN links are
supported.

The DECNIS software provides X.25 gateway and relay services to connect end
systems on a LAN to X.25 Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) connected directly
to the DECNIS or connected over an X.25 Packet Switched Data Network
(PSDN).

The DECNIS software image is installed and configured on a host system
called the load host. Once configured, the DECNIS software image and
configuration file is loaded from the load host system to the target DECNIS
unit. When loaded, the DECNIS software image can be stored in internal
non-volatile FLASH) memory so that subsequent software loads can be
performed without the need for loading from a load host (flash loading).
DECNIS systems equipped with the MPC-II (DNSAN-BH) and MPCIII (DNSBN-AH and
DNSBN-BH) can store multiple configuration and image files in non-volatile
(FLASH) memory.

The DECNIS software is managed using the Network Command Language (NCL)
command line interface which can be run on the DECNIS MPC-II (DNSANBH) or
MPC-III (DNSBN-AH or DNSBN-BH) and accessed via the console, or from any
Windows 95[R], Windows NT[R], Digital UNIX (formerly DEC OSF/1), OpenVMS
for Alpha or OpenVMS for VAX system. Event logging and data tracing
utilities are also available on Digital UNIX, OpenVMS for Alpha and OpenVMS
for VAX systems to assist problem solving by logging network events and by
tracing control messages received or sent by the DECNIS software.

The DECNIS software can be managed from the POLYCENTER/NetView[R] network
management platform or any system supporting the Simple Network Management
Protocol (SNMP). SNMP sets, gets, and traps are supported where appropriate
for MIB-II, Bridge MIB, FDDI MIB, DS3/E3 MIB and Digital Vendor MIB
variables.

IP Routing

The DECNIS software provides support for the following IP routing
protocols:

   * OSPF V2 (RFC 1247)

   * Integrated IS-IS (RFC 1195)

   * RIP (RFC 1058)

   * BGP-4 (RFC 1771)

   * EGP (RFCs 827, 888, and 904)

The DECNIS supports the OSPF Version 2 protocol as defined by RFC-1247. TOS
0 routing only is supported. The DECNIS OSPF implementation also supports
the modifications and enhancements proposed in the replacement draft RFC,
in particular the virtual link support enhancements and support for IP
address super-netting. OSPF is configured using the DECNIS configuration
utility and managed dynamically using the NCL command line interface.

The DECNIS supports the Integrated IS-IS routing protocol as defined in RFC
1195. When using Integrated IS-IS, the software supports equalcost path
splitting of IP data over up to four equal-cost paths. Variable, but
contiguous, IP subnet masks are also supported. Integrated IS-IS is
configured using the DECNIS configuration utility and managed dynamically
using the NCL command line interface.

The DECNIS supports Border Gateway Protocol Version 4 (BGP-4) as defined in
RFC 1771 to provide inter-Autonomous System routing. An Autonomous System
is a single administrative domain in which routers exchange intra-domain
routing information. BGP-4 allows the DECNIS to exchange intra-domain
routes with other BGP-4 routers in other Autonomous Systems. The DECNIS is
both a Border Router and BGP Speaker and implements both send and receive
policies using Route Propagation and Filtering. BGP-4 is managed using the
NCL command line interface. Note that an MPC-II (DNSAN-BH) or MPC-III
(DNSBN-AH or DNSBN-BH) must be installed to run BGP-4.

The DECNIS also supports the RIP (RFC 1058) and EGP (RFCs 827, 888, and
904) routing protocols. Support for multiple instances of RIP and EGP is
provided. In addition to IP routing protocols, the software also supports
IP reachable addresses (static routes). RIP and EGP are configured using
the DECNIS configuration utility and managed dynamically using the NCL
command line interface. MIB-II variables as defined in RFC 1213 can also be
managed using SNMP sets and gets.

The DECNIS software supports Virtual Router Cluster (also known as IP
Standby), a mechanism that greatly improves the resilience of IP backbone
networks. Enhancements have also been made to the Integrated ISIS routing
protocol algorithm to reduce the time taken to re-compute new routes.
Virtual Router Cluster works in conjunction with Integrated IS-IS by
providing fast IP router failover, should a router, its LAN connection, or
one of its WAN circuits fail. In a typical network, failover is achieved in
a way that is totally transparent to applications running on IP host
systems.

The DECNIS software supports Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) as
specified in the draft RFCs, "PIM Protocol Specification, January 1995" and
"PIM Motivation and Architecture, January 1995". The DECNIS implementation
of PIM implements Dense Mode only. PIM allows IP packets to be forwarded to
a defined group of hosts simultaneously. Each host in the multicast group
must support RFC 1112, "Host Extensions for IP Multicasting". Note that an
MPC-II (DNSAN-BH) or MPC-III (DNSBNAH or DNSBN-BH) must be installed to run
PIM.

The DECNIS software supports full propagation of routes between different
routing protocols, for example between BGP-4, OSPF, Integrated IS-IS, RIP,
and EGP. The propagation of IP routes learnt through one routing protocol
into another protocol can be managed using the DECNIS configuration utility
and the NCL command line interface. Controls can be added to include or
exclude routes from single nodes, subnets, or collections of subnets. For
RIP and EGP, controls can set up between multiple instances of each
protocol.

The DECNIS software communicates with IP hosts and gateways on the local
LAN using the ARP protocol (RFC 826). Proxy ARP (RFC 1027) is also
supported. The DECNIS software also supports Path MTU Discovery technique
as specified in RFC 1191, and ICMP Router Discovery Messages as specified
in RFC 1256 to allow IP hosts to distinguish the DECNIS as a router using
ICMP messages and procedures. Using ICMP, the DECNIS periodically
broadcasts ICMP Router Advertisement messages and responds to ICMP Router
Solicitation messages from IP Hosts. All management parameters defined in
RFC 1256 are supported. DECNIS also supports an IP Helper function which
allows IP routing to forward packets for particular UDP ports to particular
IP addresses. Popular UPD ports which can make use of this feature include
TFTP (port 69), DNS (port 53), Time Service (port 37), NETBios Name Server
(port 137) and NETBios Datagram Server (port 138).

The DECNIS software supports IP routing over CSMA/CD, FDDI, PPP, HDLC,
Frame Relay, SMDS and ATM PVCs, or dynamically assigned X.25 circuits. The
DECNIS supports IP routing over X.25 data links in accordance with RFC 877,
and over PPP data links in accordance with RFC 1332. The DECNIS implements
LLC encapsulation according to RFC 1483 to provide Classical IP over ATM
PVCs according to RFC 1577.

DECnet Routing

The DECNIS software implements both the DECnet Phase IV routing algorithm
(routing vector) and the DECnet/OSI Phase V routing algorithm (link state
routing). The DECNIS software supports both intra-area routing (level 1)
and inter-area routing (level 2). The DECNIS software can run either the
Phase IV or Phase V routing algorithm in either combination at each level.
When running the Phase V algorithms at either level 1 or level 2, the
routing software is still able to handle traffic generated by DECnet Phase
IV end systems and performs any necessary address and header conversions.
DECnet routing is configured using the DECNIS configuration utility and is
managed using the NCL command line interface.

The DECNIS software supports path splitting over up to four routing
circuits. If the cost between the router and the destination node is the
same on multiple WAN circuits, then the DECNIS software splits the traffic
across all the circuits.

It is also possible to route IP traffic using RIP within a DECnet Phase IV
only network by running RIP over the DECnet Phase IV level 1 or level 2
links. An IS-IS routing circuit is required in order to handle IP traffic
either within a level 1 area or between areas over a level 2 link.

The DECNIS supports DECnet routing over CSMA/CD, FDDI, HDLC, DDCMP, and
Frame Relay circuits, and over dynamically and statically assigned X.25
circuits. The DECNIS software also supports DECnet routing over PPP data
links in accordance with RFC 1376.

OSI Routing

The DECNIS software fully implements the requirements of an OSI
Intermediate System. The DECNIS software exchanges information about
reachability of end systems using the OSI IS-IS Intra-Domain Routing
Exchange Protocol as specified in ISO/IEC 10589. OSI-compatible end systems
on the same LAN can exchange information with the DECNIS software and use
the OSI End System to Intermediate System (ES-IS) Routing Exchange Protocol
as specified in ISO 9542. OSI routing is configured using the DECNIS
configuration utility and is managed using the NCL command line interface.

The DECNIS software supports OSI Connectionless Network Protocol (CLNP)
routing as specified in ISO 8473, over CSMA/CD, FDDI, HDLC, Frame Relay and
SMDS circuits, and over dynamically and statically assigned X.25 circuits.
The DECNIS software also supports OSI CLNP routing over PPP data links in
accordance with RFC 1377.

Novell NetWare Routing

The DECNIS software provides support of native Novell NetWare protocols
over Ethernet and FDDI. Ethernet-II, 802.2, Encapsulated Ethernet (802.2
SNAP), and 802.3 RAW (Novell) data link formats are supported. The
following Novell NetWare protocols are supported:

   * Novell NetWare IPX Forwarding

   * Novell NetWare Routing Information Protocol (RIP)

   * Novell NetWare Service Access Protocol (SAP)

Novell IPX is supported over wide area links using IP encapsulation
according to RFC 1234. The DECNIS software also supports native IPX over
leased line circuits using the PPP data link protocol (IPXWAN) according to
RFC 1362 but with no negotiated options. Novell IPX routing is configured
using the DECNIS configuration utility and is managed using the NCL command
line interface.

The DECNIS software has been tested and certified for use as a LAN router
with Novell NetWare V3.11 and V4.01 by Novell's test laboratory in Utah.

AppleTalk Routing

The DECNIS software provides support of native EtherTalk[R], the Apple[R]
specification for AppleTalk over Ethernet and FDDI. EtherTalk uses 802.2
SNAP data link format. The following AppleTalk protocols are supported:

   * AppleTalk Phase-II Forwarding

   * AppleTalk Phase-II EtherTalk

   * AppleTalk Phase-II Address Resolution Protocol (AARP)

   * AppleTalk Phase-II Routing Table Maintenance Protocol (RTMP)

   * AppleTalk Phase-II Name Binding Protocol (NBP)

   * AppleTalk Phase-II Zone Information Protocol (ZIP)

   * AppleTalk Phase-II Echo Protocol (echo replies only)

AppleTalk is supported over wide area links to other DECNIS systems using
IP encapsulation. AppleTalk routing is configured using the DECNIS
configuration utility and is managed using the NCL command line interface.

Bridging

The DECNIS software supports local and remote bridging between LANs for
protocols that cannot be routed (e.g., Digital's LAT) or that are not
supported by the DECNIS routing software (e.g., Xerox[R] XNS). The DECNIS
software supports a maximum of 15 local or remote bridge port.

DECnet, IP, OSI, IPX, and AppleTalk protocols are normally routed and
cannot be bridged except in the following cases:

   * IP, IPX, and AppleTalk traffic can either be individually routed or
     bridged on a system wide basis. When routing is not enabled for any
     one or more of these protocols, it will be bridged on all in terfaces.
     Bridge filtering can be enabled for IP, IPX, and AppleTalk on a
     port-by-port basis.

   * OSI null-Internet frames will always be bridged over the Ethernet or
     FDDI interfaces.

The DECNIS software implements the IEEE 802.1D Spanning Tree Protocol and
will interoperate with other Digital or IEEE 802.1D-compliant bridges in
the same extended LAN. When used as a local bridge, the DECNIS software
forwards data packets from one LAN interface to another LAN interface. When
bridging IP packets between FDDI and Ethernet interfaces, frames larger
than 1518 bytes will be fragmented before transmission over the Ethernet.

Remote bridging is supported over PPP, HDLC, Frame Relay and ATM PVCs; it
is not supported over X.25 and SMDS data links.

Remote bridging is also supported between a DECNIS unit and
NSC[R]/Vitalink[R] TransLAN[R] bridges using the Vitalink Control Protocol
(VCP). Remote bridging is supported between a DECNIS 500/600 using the DEC
WANcontroller 622 network interface card and NSC/Vitalink TransLAN III, IV,
320, 335 or 350 remote bridges or TransPATH 335 or 350 bridge/routers
running either TransLAN V11.1.4 or TransPATH V11.2.5 software or later.

When used with TransLAN bridges only one bridging link is supported at a
time; load balancing over multiple links is not supported. The Vitalink DLS
protocol is not supported by the DECNIS.

Tinygram compression is supported in accordance with RFC 1220 over PPP and
VCP data links. This allows Ethernet and 802.3 frames which are padded with
zeros, such as LAT frames, to be compressed over remote bridging links.
Bridging over multiple remote hops is supported subject to the Bridging
Configuration Guidelines section below.

Bridging is configured using the DECNIS configuration utility and is
managed using the NCL command line interface. Bridge MIB variables as
defined in RFC 1493 can also be managed using SNMP sets and gets. Bridge
traffic, both local and remote, may be filtered based on a combination of
source or destination address and protocol type on a port-byport basis.

Bridging Configuration Guidelines

When bridging over remote links, the performance of delay-sensitive
protocols (such as LAT) cannot be guaranteed without careful consideration
of the number of bridging hops and the speed of the lines connecting the
DECNIS units.

Digital warrants and supports the DECNIS product when used in extended LAN
configurations subject to the following configuration restrictions:

   * The minimum line speed supported for remote bridging between DECNIS
     units is 56 Kbits/s.

   * Remote bridging is supported over PPP, HDLC, Frame Relay and ATM PVCs
     but is not supported over X.25 or SMDS circuits, or over satellite
     links.

   * The maximum number of bridging ports supported by the DECNIS is 15.
     Consequently, the maximum number of remote bridging links that can be
     configured on the DECNIS is limited to 15.

   * A maximum of seven local and remote bridges may be configured in
     series between any two communicating end stations. Each DECNIS unit,
     or any other IEEE 802.1D or LANbridge 100 compatible bridge, counts as
     one bridge towards this maximum configuration of seven bridges.

   * Local Area VAXcluster (LAVC) is not supported over remote bridging
     links.

   * PATHWORKS services may be restricted over remote bridging links;
     please refer to the relevant Software Product Descriptions for further
     information.

   * When bridging between a DECNIS and NSC/Vitalink TransLAN, load
     balancing and DLS are not supported.

In addition to the above configuration restrictions, and, when using 56
Kbits/s or 64 Kbits/s links between DECNIS units for remote bridging of
LAT, Digital also recommends the following configuration guidelines to
ensure reliable operation:

   * A maximum of two serial synchronous links should be used in the
     spanning tree path between the LAT server and the LAT host.

   * A minimum of 3 Kbits/s should be allocated for each active LAT session
     which needs to be supported simultaneously across the remote link.
     When using Tinygram compression, 2 Kbits/s should be allocated for
     each active LAT session.

   * Links should be reserved for LAT and not shared with routed traffic
     such as DECnet, OSI, or IP. Also, other bridged traffic which may
     generate unnecessary traffic over the remote link should be filered
     using the DECNIS Bridge Filtering facilities.

Routing over X.25

The DECNIS software supports routing over statically and dynamically
assigned X.25 virtual circuits. Static X.25 circuits are established when
the routing circuit is enabled and remain established until the routing
circuit is disabled. Dynamically assigned X.25 circuits are established
only when there is information to send over the routing circuit. They are
disconnected when there is no further information to send.

The DECNIS X.25 software supports routing over either Permanent Virtual
Circuits (PVCs) or Switched Virtual Circuits (SVCs). Each X.25 virtual
circuit can run only one routing protocol. However, different routing
protocols can be run over separate virtual circuits on the same X.25 DTE
connection.

Routing and Bridging over Frame Relay

The DECNIS software supports connections over Frame Relay data links as
specified in the Frame Relay Specification jointly developed by Digital
Equipment Corporation, StrataCom[R], Inc., Northern Telecom[R], and Cisco
Systems Inc.

Multiple virtual circuits can be multiplexed over a single Frame Relay link
using the Data Link Control Identifier (DLCI) field of the Frame Relay LAPD
header. For details of the Frame Relay options implemented, refer to the
CONFORMANCE TO STANDARDS section of this SPD.

Routing of IP, DECnet, and OSI protocols, and bridging of other protocols,
is supported over Frame Relay PVCs using PPP encapsulation within the Frame
Relay frame. IPX and AppleTalk can also be routed over Frame Relay within
IP. The DECNIS Frame Relay implementation supports both the LMI and ANSI-D
switch control procedures.

Frame Relay is only supported on the DEC WANcontroller 622 and 622/HS
network interface cards. A maximum of 32 Frame Relay PVCs can be configured
per physical interface with an overall limit of 128 per DECNIS system. A
maximum of 15 Frame Relay PVCs can be configured for remote bridging per
DECNIS system.

Routing over Switched Multi-megabit Data Service (SMDS)

Switched Multi-megabit Data Service is a connectionless, cell-switched data
transport service and is available at speeds between 56 Kbits/s and 45
Mbits/s. The DECNIS software implements the SMDS Date Exchange Interface
(DXI) according to the Bellcore specification using SIP 3 PDUs of up to
4500 bytes with DXI CRC and with 6 octet SMDS addresses. An external SMDS
CSU/DSU is required to provide SIP 2 and SIP 1 functions.

Using the WANcontroller 622/HS, the following SMDS Classes of Service are
supported:

   * 1.473 Mbits/s using T1 or E1 access lines

   * 4 Mbits/s, 10 Mbits/s, or 16 Mbits/s using T3 or E3 access lines

Routing of IP, DECnet, and OSI protocols is supported over SMDS using OSPF,
Integrated IS-IS and RIP routing protocols. IPX and AppleTalk can also be
routed over SMDS using encapsulation within IP.

Routing and Bridging over ATM

The DECNIS software supports ATM AAL5 and multiple PVC connections as
specified in the ATM Forum Public and Private UNI V3.0.

Routing of IP, DECnet, and OSI protocols, and bridging of other protocols,
is supported over ATM PVCs using LLC encapsulation within ATM cells as
defined in RFC 1483. IPX and AppleTalk can also be routed over ATM using
encapsulation within IP. The DECNIS also supports Inverse ARP (RFC 1293)
and Classical IP as defined in RFC 1577.

ATM is only supported on the DECNIS ATMcontroller 631 network interface
card. A maximum of 127 ATM PVCs can be configured per DECNIS system. A
maximum of 15 ATM PVCs can be configured for remote bridging per DECNIS
system. Digital's FLOWmaster[R] credit based rate limiting is supported by
the ATMcontroller 631 for interoperability with the GIGAswitch/ATM.

Note that an MPC-II (DNSAN-BH) or MPC-III (DNSBN-AH or DNSBN-BH) must be
installed when using the DECNIS ATMcontroller 631.

Backup Circuits

The DECNIS supports a backup circuit feature which detects the failure of a
primary routing circuit and establish an alternative or backup routing
circuit for the duration of the failure. Primary routing circuits can be
PPP, HDLC or DDCMP leased line circuits while secondary circuits can be
leased line or switched public network services such as dialup, ISDN or
X.25. Invoke and revoke timers can be set up to control the time to wait
before enabling or disabling the backup circuit.

A primary circuit and a backup circuit can be grouped so that one backup
circuit can be shared between a number of primary circuits to reduce costs.
For example, an ISDN connection can be used as a backup circuit for a
number of leased line primary circuits. Backup circuits can also be
cascaded such that a backup circuit of one group can be a primary circuit
of another.

Packet Prioritization

The DECNIS software supports packet prioritization on the LANcontroller
601/602 and WANcontroller 614/618/622/622HS network interface cards so that
different protocols or traffic types can be given the different priorities
over LAN and WAN links. Traffic can be prioritized based on protocol type,
for example IP, IPX, DECnet, OSI or bridge traffic. Within IP, traffic can
be additionally prioritized based on TCP/UDP port number, protocol type or
Type of Service. Bridge traffic can also be prioritized based on SAP value,
PID value or Ethernet type.

The DECNIS supports up to eight levels of priority. Packets can be assigned
to priority groups which are then assigned to one of the eight queues. The
queues are then processed in order such that high priority packets are
always transmitted first. The maximum queue length can be set for each
queue to ensure that packets in each queue are processed appropriately.

A simple packet filtering mechanism for out bound WAN traffic can be
implemented by assigning packets to be filtered to a specific queue whose
queue length has been set to zero. Packet and byte counters allow the
number of packets transmitted and discarded to be monitored on a per
interface basis.

Note that the DECNIS automatically prioritizes routing and bridge control
traffic to ensure that network stability is maintained at all times.

Pattern Matching

An extension to the packet prioritization mechanism allows priority packets
to be further classified by packet pattern matching. Specific bit sequences
can be matched with masks and on the basis of a match, packets can be
assigned to different priority queues. For example, LAT service groups can
be filtered to allow only certain services to be advertised across the
network.

IP Packet Filtering

The DECNIS supports IP packet filtering at the routing level to control
access between IP hosts and to control bandwidth utilization on the
network. Packet filtering can be set up on each interface based on:

   * Protocol type such as TCP, UDP, ICMP, IP

   * Source/destination address and mask

   * Source/destination port and mask

   * IP protocol number

   * ICMP message type and mask

Combinations of filter characteristics can be set up to describe the packet
types to filter. The DECNIS only filters on outgoing circuits which means
that the DECNIS will receive all packets before applying packet filters.

Secure Connection Firewall

The Secure Connection Firewall (also known as the Secure Connection
Manager) provides filtering of network connect requests to deny or permit
access to network resources. The Secure Connection Firewall implements
access control by creating logical barriers around one or more systems or
groups of systems called network domains.

Nodes, circuits, applications and users can be combined into groups that
share the same security requirements and access rules can be set up to
apply to each group. Access rules can be based on parameters such as time
of day, circuit name, user and host name, source and destination address,
IP port and protocol, DECnet node and object, OSI node and application.

The Secure Connection Firewall is set up using the clearVISN DECNIS
Configurator utility.

Data Compression

The DECNIS supports data compression on the DEC WANcontroller W622 and
W622/HS network interface cards. The data compression uses a proprietary
algorithm operating over HDLC data links and only interoperates with other
DECNIS. The algorithm provides a typical data compression ratio of 1.7:1
depending on the type of data.

The DECNIS only supports data compression of routed (i.e. sequenced)
traffic across HDLC data links. However, bridged (i.e. unsequenced) traffic
can also be supported over HDLC links that are running data compression for
routed traffic. Packet prioritization, pattern match filtering and IP
packet filtering can also be implemented over HDLC links that are running
data compression.

Since data compression is implemented in software on the DEC WANcontroller
622 and 622/HS network interface cards, the maximum line speeds that can be
supported while data compression is enabled is significantly lower than the
maximum speed supported without data compression. The maximum line speed at
which data compression can be run reliably is 384 Kbits/s per interface for
the DEC WANcontroller 622/HS and 128 Kbits/s per interface for the DEC
WANcontroller 622.

X.25 Gateway

When operating as an X.25 Gateway, the DECNIS software transmits and
receives X.25 packets to and from any of the following systems:

   * Any Digital systems which support the DNA Gateway Access Protocol
     (GAP)

   * Any systems located on the same LAN which support the ISO Logical Link
     Control 2 (LLC2) protocol (as described in ISO 8881)

   * Any X.25 DTE accessible over an X.25 Public Switched Data Network
     (PSDN) connected to the DECNIS

   * Any X.25 DTE connected directly to a port of the DECNIS operating in
     X.25 DCE mode (ISO 8208 point-to-point mode)

   * Any X.25 DTE connected to any other DECNIS accessible over the
     DECnet/OSI routing network

When providing wide area access to an X.25 PSDN for end systems on the LAN
which use LLC2, the DECNIS software fully implements the recommendations in
ISO Technical Report 10029 as a CONS LAN/WAN relay.

X.25 packets can be relayed locally between any X.25 DTE attached to the
DECNIS hardware unit and any other similarly attached X.25 DTE or any X.25
system connected to the same LAN. Additionally, X.25 packets can be relayed
to remote X.25 DTEs accessible to other DECNIS or DEC X.25 gateway 100/500
servers over a DECnet/OSI routing network. The software does not support
the relaying of X.25 packets generated from an X.25 DTE connected to one
X.25 PSDN to an X.25 DTE connected to another X.25 PSDN.

X.25 DTE and Virtual Circuit Support

The DECNIS allows multiple connections to one or more X.25 PSDNs and can
share outgoing calls between all of the DTEs connected to an X.25 PSDN.
Both Switched Virtual Circuits (SVCs) and Permanent Virtual Circuits
(PVCs)are supported. The X.25 Networks section of this SPD provides details
of the public X.25 PSDNs and X.25 (1988) optional facilities supported by
the DECNIS X.25 software.

The number of X.25 DTEs and virtual circuits that the DECNIS X.25 software
supports depends on the type of management processor installed.

Notes:

   * The actual number of X.25 connections that the DECNIS can sustain at
     any time may be less than indicated and depends on such factors as the
     rate at which calls are set up and cleared down, the level of traffic,
     and the ratio of routing to gateway and relay traffic.

   * For routing over X.25 and X.25 gateway (GAP), one virtual circuit is
     established per X.25 connection. For X.25 relay (LLC2), two virtual
     circuits are established per X.25 connection, one incoming vir tual
     circuit and one outgoing virtual circuit.

X.25 Accounting and Security

The following accounting information is provided by the DECNIS X.25 Gateway
software:

   * Logging of virtual circuit accounting when calls are cleared

   * Logging of accounting records to a designated Event Logging sink

   * Logging to multiple sinks for reliability

The following security mechanisms are supported by the DECNIS X.25 Gateway
software:

   * Inbound and outbound calls can be controlled on the basis of the
     remote DTE, the application, and, if applicable, the X.25 Access node

   * Access to accounting sink management is restricted to authorized users

   * Access to accounting source management is restricted to authorized
     users

Installation and Configuration

The DECNIS software image is installed on a host system called the load
host. The following load hosts systems are supported:

   * PCs running Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows NT

   * Alpha systems running Digital UNIX

   * Alpha systems running OpenVMS

   * VAX systems running OpenVMS

Once installed on the load host, the DECNIS software is configured using
the host configuration and DECNIS configuration utilities supplied with the
product. The host configuration utility allows the DECNIS units to be
defined in the load host's network node database. It also allows the
appropriate system image and unique configuration file for each DECNIS unit
to be defined in the load host's network node database.

The DECNIS configuration is used to create the unique configuration file
for each DECNIS unit.

The DECNIS software image and individual configuration files are loaded
from the load host system to each target DECNIS unit using BOOTP or
Digital's Maintenance Operation Protocol (MOP). Loading can be either
locally on the same LAN or extended LAN (downline loading), or over an HDLC
or PPP link from a local DECNIS unit connected directly to the target
DECNIS unit (agent loading).

When using agent loading, the DECNIS system performing the loading
operation must be configured to copy the required files from a suitable
load host. Agent loading of DECNIS units may also be daisy-chained over a
number of HDLC links provided that the first DECNIS in the chain is on the
same LAN as the load host and each member of the chain is a DECNIS unit.

The minimum requirement is for one load host. However, the DECNIS software
image and configuration files can be copied to any number of remote load
hosts within the network for local loading. The DECNIS software allows
BOOTP load requests broadcast over a LAN to be forwarded to a BOOTP server
located anywhere within the network. This helps to protect against loss of
service if the main load host is unavailable or unable to load the system
for any other reason.

When loaded, the DECNIS software image and, optionally, the configuration
file, can be stored in the DECNIS internal non-volatile (FLASH) memory so
that subsequent software loads can be performed without the need to load
from a load host (flash loading). The FLASH memory can be updated
dynamically while the DECNIS system is running without disrupting network
service. The FLASH memory on the MPC-III (DNSBN-AH or DNSBN-BH) can also be
partioned into separate areas for system images and configuration files to
provide greater flexibility.

clearVISN DECNIS Configurator

The clearVISN DECNIS Configurator is a Windows 95 and Windows NT graphical
utility for creating and modifying DECNIS configuration files. The utility
configures system, routing and data link paramaters as well as the Secure
Connection Firewall and Route Propagation and Filtering. DECNIS
configurations can be generated live or generated offline for loading at a
convenient time. The clearVISN DECNIS Configurator also loads the
configuration files using BOOTP and TFTP. A clearVISN BOOTP/TFTP Server
utility is also included with the clearVISN DECNIS Configurator.

A scripting feature allows extra DECNIS configuration commands to be edited
and then loaded as part of the main configuration. The scripting feature
allows configuration of functions that are not supported by the clearVISN
DECNIS Configurator.

An NCL command line interface utility is also provided which sets up a
Telnet session to the DECNIS console. This allows the DECNIS to be managed
dynamically using the NCL command line interface.

The clearVISN DECNIS Configurator is included with the DECNIS Windows 95/NT
software kit and is also offered as part of the clearVISN product set.

Management

The DECNIS software conforms to both the IETF Structure of Management
Information and to Digital's DECnet Network Architecture (DNA). Management
of the DECNIS is supported using either the Simple Network Management
Protocol (SNMP) or Digital's implementation of the Control Management
Information Protocol (CMIP).

The DECNIS V4.0 software supports two types of management processor card:

   * MPC-II (DNSAN-BH) - this card has 16 MB of dynamic memory and 4 MB of
     non-volatile (FLASH) memory.

   * MPC-III (DNSBN-AH or DNSBN-BH) - this card has either 16 or 32 MB of
     dynamic memory and 4 or 8 MB of non-volatile (FLASH) memory.

Both the MPC-II and MPC-III have a console port for out-of-band management.
The console port provides VT100 terminal support and full modem control for
remote connection over a dial up line. The MPC-II and MPC-III also
implement TCP and Telnet so that the DECNIS can be managed in an IP only
environment. Telnet server only is implemented to prevent the local DECNIS
console from being used to set up a remote connection to another DECNIS or
IP host.

Note that the DECNIS V4.0 software also supports the MPC-I (DNSAN-AH) which
has 8 MB of dynamic memory and 2 MB of non-volatile (FLASH) memory.
However, some DECNIS V4.0 software features are not supported on the MPC-I.
Refer to the "Hardware Requirements" section for further details.

The DECNIS software is managed dynamically using the Network Command
Language (NCL) command line interface. The MPC-II (DNSAN-BH) and MPCIII
(DNSBN-AH or DNSBN-BH) support on-board NCL for dynamic out-ofband
management of the local DECNIS router and remote DECNIS routers from the
console interface. NCL can also be run on any Windows 95/NT PC, Digital
UNIX, OpenVMS for Alpha or OpenVMS for VAX system to provide in-band
management of DECNIS systems over the network.

Dynamic management tasks that can be performed using NCL include:

   * Management of connections, for example, set up the data links, en able
     and disable circuits

   * Monitoring of network traffic, for example, enable event logging,
     display counters

   * Problem solving, for example, test circuit availability, perform
     loopback tests

Event logging and data tracing utilities are also available on Digital
UNIX, OpenVMS for Alpha, or OpenVMS for VAX systems to assist problem
solving by logging network events and by tracing control messages received
or sent by the DECNIS software.

The DECNIS software can be managed dynamically from any system supporting
the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). SNMP sets and gets are
supported where appropriate for the variables defined in the following
Management Information Bases (MIBs):

   * Digital Vendor MIB

   * MIB-II (RFC 1213)

   * Bridge MIB (RFC 1493)

   * FDDI MIB (RFC 1285)

   * DS3/E3 MIB (RFC 1407)

MIB-II interface support is provided for CSMA/CD, FDDI, PPP, HDLC, VCP,
LAPB, DDCMP and ATM AAL5 data links. SNMP traps are also supported with the
ability to send traps to up to four destinations. SNMP can only be used to
manage MIB variables when IP routing is enabled.

The DECNIS responds to, but can not source, IP Pings and OSI Echo requests.
The DECNIS can also forward echo requests and responses.

clearVISN Router Manager

The clearVISN Router Manager is an SNMP management utility that manages
DECNIS, RouteAbout and DECswitch routers, as well as other vendors'
routers. The application also supports other routers and switches that
implement MIB-II and other standard MIBs.

For DECNIS, the clearVISN Router Manager provides fault detection, path
tracing between selected routers, event generation and reporting, and
performance monitoring. The performance monitoring includes both real time
and historical views of data grouped by routers or interfaces.

Digital Trace Facility

The Digital Trace Facility allows data to be monitored as it flows through
the software layers and modules of the DECNIS. The DTF application collects
data from trace points embedded in the router software to help
troubleshooting and problem analysis.

Network Sizing

The DECNIS software allows memory to be allocated to statically assigned
network parameters to suit different network requirements. This memory is
allocated during configuration. The memory left over can be allocated
during operation to dynamically assigned network parameters when needed.
This feature is called Dynamic Database Sizing.

The DECNIS configuration utility checks to ensure that memory is not over
allocated and also indicates how much memory is left over for dynamically
assigned parameters. When the DECNIS is running, event messages are
generated if any of these parameters are approached or exceeded. Full
information about which network parameters can be set and how much memory
is used is included in the DECNIS documentation. Please consult your local
Digital office for more details and for assistance with network sizing and
planning.

DECNIS Hardware

The DECNIS software requires either a DECNIS 500 or DECNIS 600 series
hardware unit and one or more network interface cards. The DECNIS 500
supports up to two network interface cards and the DECNIS 600 supports up
to seven network interface cards.

The following LAN interface cards occupy a single slot of the DECNIS
enclosure and are supported by the DECNIS 500 and DECNIS 600 hardware

Physical Line Support

The DECNIS WAN network interface cards support the following electrical
interfaces:

   * DEC WANcontroller 614

        o V.28 (EIA-RS232-D/EIA-RS232-C)

        o V.36/V.11 (RS449/RS422)

        o V.35

A multi-standard distribution panel with separate adapter cables provides
the necessary interchange circuits for each synchronous port, allowing
different interface standards to be supported on each port.

   * DEC WANcontroller 618

        o V.28 (EIA-RS232-D/EIA-RS232-C)

        o V.36/V.11 (RS449/RS422)

        o V.35

Separate distribution panels with appropriate interface cables provide the
necessary interchange circuits for each synchronous port allowing the same
interface standard to be supported on each port. An extra adapter cable is
used with the RS422/V.11 distribution panel to connect to British Telecom
Kilostream services.

   * DEC WANcontroller 622 and 622/HS:

        o V.36/V.11 (RS449/RS422)

        o V.35

        o X.21 (leased line services)

        o British Telecom Kilostream and Megastream

Where appropriate, separate adapter cables provide the necessary
interchange circuits for each port. An X.21 adapter cable is used to
connect to British Telecom Kilostream and Megastream services.

Reflected clock signals may need to be set up when using the WANcontroller
622/HS to connect to DSU/CSUs at line speeds greater than 6 Mbits/s. This
depends on the interface and the length of cable used.

The synchronous ports on each network interface cards provide only the
electrical interface of a DTE rather than a DCE, and do not provide clock
signals. An external clock source (such as a modem or DSU/CSU) is required
for each synchronous connection.

Table 3 shows the adapter cables required for each of the electrical
interface types.

Notes:

1. This should be ordered as part BS23V-02, which contains not only the
BC23V-02 adapter cable to provide the V.28/V.24 (RS232-D) in terface, but
also an adapter that allows it to be used for RS232 C as well. It is only
supported with the DEC WANcontroller 614; it is not supported for use with
the DEC WANcontroller 622 or 622/HS.

2. The BC19C-02 adapter cable is used with a 50-way D-type connector with
the DEC WANcontroller 614 when connecting to the BT Kilostream service or
with the DEC WANcontroller 622 or 622/HS when connect ing to the BT
Kilostream and Megastream services, or X.21 leased line services. When
connecting the DEC WANcontroller 618 to use the BT Kilostream service, the
BC21G-02 should be used in conjunction with the V.11/RS422 distribution
panel.

T1 and G.703 Services

The DEC WANcontroller 622 and 622/HS support only clear channel interfaces.
Connection to a T1 or G.703 line requires a V.35/RS422 to T1/G.703 DSU/CSU
converter to provide framing to meet G.704. The DEC WANcontroller 622 and
622/HS do not provide either T1 framing pulses or separate channels for 64
Kbits/s control data for G.703.

The DEC WANcontroller 622 and 622/HS do not guarantee line density. T1
links can offer only 1.536 Mbits/s or 1.344 Mbits/s rates. 1.536 Mbits/s
rates require the DSU/CSU converter to offer B8ZS and the line to accept
bipolar violations. 1.334 Mbits/s rates require the DSU/CSU converter to
offer B7.

The DEC WANcontroller 622 and 622/HS use CCITT 114 to clock data out of the
DTE and will source a CCITT 113 transmit clock. CCITT 113 should be used by
the DCE to receive the transmit data. The DEC WANcontroller 622 and 622/HS
implement CCITT 113 as a buffered version of CCITT 114. This clocking
scheme ensures both network synchronization and minimized skew between the
clock and data for a range of cable lengths and parameters.

If the transmit clocking mechanism is not provided by the DCE, the DCE must
provide a method of adjusting the phase of the clock used to sample the
data with respect to that supplied to the DTE. This requires that the DCE
provide test points to allow analysis of the clock and data wave forms and
that this adjustment be performed on installation and after any subsequent
alteration of the connection cable. This alternative method is also
required for DCEs using the X.21 interface.

The DECNIS ATMcontroller 631/E3 supports connection to an E3 line at a line
rate of 34.368M bits/s as per G.703. Connection is provided using dual 75
ohm BNC connectors. Certain service providers may require a separate CSU to
isolate the ATMcontroller 631 from the network.

The DECNIS ATMcontroller 631/T3 supports connection to a DS3 line at a line
rate of 44.736M bits/s as per G.703. Connection is provided using dual 75
ohm BNC connectors. Certain service providers may require a separate CSU to
isolate the ATMcontroller 631 from the network.

For more information about CSU/DSU converters available in your country,
please contact your local Digital office.

Notes:

1. The X.25 relay does not act on any of these fields. The informa tion
contained in these fields is passed transparently and has only end-to-end
significance.

2. PSDN hunt groups are supported but each DTE must be assigned a unique
address independent of the hunt group address.

3. Support for this facility depends on the user application and the X.25
client implementation. Refer to the X.25 client product SPD for details.

4. For connector mode operation, the facilities supported by the DEC NIS
software may be restricted by the X.25 client implementation. Refer to the
X.25 client product SPD for details.

The DECNIS software does not support the following items of the ITUT X.25
recommendation:

   * Multi-link protocol

   * Use of the D-bit in outgoing packets

Performance

When operating over serial line connections the overall packet rate will be
less than that indicated by the aggregate line speeds and is determined by
such factors as:

   * Type of traffic (routing updates or data packets) and data rates

   * Mix of protocol types

   * Proportion of leased line to X.25 and Frame Relay traffic

   * The path of messages passing through the product (WAN-to-WAN, WAN
     to-LAN, or LAN-to-LAN)

   * Communications line characteristics

   * Frequency and type of errors on the serial links

   * Network topology

   * Protocol overhead

Please contact your local Digital office for further details of the
performance characteristics of the DECNIS product.

These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The sizes
are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's system
environment, configuration, and software options. The space indicated for
permanent occupancy does not include the space required to receive an
upline dump if that facility is enabled. The amount of space required for
dumps depends on the exact hardware configuration. This could be from
20,000 to 100,000 blocks (10 MB to 50 MB) for each dump depending on the
DECNIS configuration.
