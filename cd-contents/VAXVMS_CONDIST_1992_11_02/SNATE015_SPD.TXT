PRODUCT NAME: DECnet/SNA VMS 3270 Terminal Emulator, Version 1.5  SPD 26.84.06

DESCRIPTION  

The DECnet/SNA VMS 3270 Terminal Emulator (3270 TE) is a layered software 
product that allows users of a VTxxx terminal (or other DIGITAL terminal or 
personal computer in VT100, VT200 or VT300 mode) on suitably configured VMS 
systems within a DECnet network to interactively access IBMROF
ROIBM is a registered trademark of International Business Machines, Inc.
F host-based 
applications.  These applications have been originally developed for IBM 3270 
display stations in a Systems Network Architecture (SNA) networking 
environment.  Access to the IBM host-based applications system from VMS systems 
is via the DECnet/SNA Gateway or via VMS/SNA software.  

In normal operation, an IBM system transfers a formatted screen, much like a 
``form'', to the 3270 block mode terminal and the user fills in any data 
required by the ``form''.  When complete, the form is transmitted to the IBM 
host as a single unit. This mechanism is emulated with a Digital character mode 
terminal by buffering the ``form'' in the DECnet host's memory and displaying 
it on the terminal.  When the screen ``form'' is complete, it is sent to the 
IBM host system via the DECnet/SNA Gateway or VMS/SNA.  

Translation tables on the respective systems convert ASCII terminal input 
(either DIGITAL Multinational Character Set or National Replacement Character 
Set) to a subset of IBM multinational EBCDIC code for transfer through either 
the DECnet/SNA Gateway or VMS/SNA software.  These translation tables may be 
modified to fit non-standard character sets.  

Users invoke the 3270 utility using the local VMS system's command language, 
including qualifiers to specify the IBM system and system resources with which 
the user wishes to connect.   While the emulation utility is operating, the 
terminal screen will be formatted in a fashion similar to a 3270 display. When 
the user has finished work on the IBM system, the 3270 emulator is dismissed 
and the terminal is ``restored'' as a VMS command terminal.  

The 3270 Terminal Emulator supports emulation of the following features of an 
IBM 3270 Display Station when attached to an IBM 3274 1C controller with the

This product has been designed such that it can be used with most IBM 
applications, however, those applications written using features not supported 
by the emulator (e.g. 3270 Extended Data Stream) must be modified.  

A readily available on-line HELP facility provides information on keys with 
altered 3270-oriented functions.  The status line as implemented on an actual 
3270 display is not supported, however much of the same information is reported 
on a special status line which may be overlaid on the VT200's 24th line.  In 
addition, the VMS system manager has the ability to re-map certain IBM key 
functions onto different locations on the DIGITAL keyboard.

Features of Version 1.5

oo VMS 3270 TE v1.5 will allow, on supported DECnet/SNA gateways and VMS/SNA 
  systems, secured LUs (Logical Units) to be accessed via a password.

oo VMS 3270 TE v1.5 will allow up to 16 alphanumeric characters to be coded in 
  the ACCESSNAME parameter.

oo VMS 3270 TE v1.5 will provide the ability to display status information on 
  the hardware status line when using a VT device (or VT emulator) that 
  supports the hardware status line.

oo VMS 3270 TE v1.5 will support Digital's License Management Facility.
