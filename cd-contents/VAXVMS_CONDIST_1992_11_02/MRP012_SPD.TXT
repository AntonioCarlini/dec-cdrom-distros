           PRODUCT NAME:  VAX Message Router/P Gateway,   SPD 28.94.02
			  Version 1.2

           DESCRIPTION

           VAX Message Router/P Gateway (MRP) is a network server lay-
           ered software product that resides on a VAX/VMS system pro-
           viding interconnection between MAILbus, Digital Equipment
           Corportation's Message Router based electronic message trans-
           fer service, and IBM[R]'s Professional Office System (PROFS[R])
           systems in an SNA network. Through MRP, users of Digital of-
           fice automation systems such as ALL-IN-1 MAIL and ALL-IN-1
           Integrated Office System can send and receive messages, doc-
           uments, and binary files (MS-DOS[R] files for example) to and
           from users of IBM PROFS office systems. Simple messages (Notes)
           may be exchanged with users of IBM's CMS systems. Restricted
           support is also provided to users of IBM's OfficeVision/VM[TM]
           systems.

           VAX Message Router/P Gateway provides both address and con-
           tent conversion for messages and documents passed between
           the Digital and the IBM PROFS networks. In this way, users
           are not required to learn any new commands or procedures ex-
           cept the new addresses representing the users of the other
           network(s) with whom they can now communicate by means of
           MRP. MRP connects to an IBM PROFS host system and other PROFS
           nodes have access to the Digital network through their RSCS
           connections over the SNA network to that IBM host. No Dig-
           ital software is required to be installed on the IBM sys-
           tem to accomplish these transfers. With some restrictions,
           MRP allows users of IBM PROFS office systems to communicate

           VAX Message Router/P Gateway, Version 1.2   SPD 28.94.02


           through MAILbus to other networks including X.400 public mes-
           saging services. Use of PROFS Extended Mail on the IBM sys-
           tem enhances PROFS user's access to these other X.400 net-
           works.

           Message address conversion is accomplished through the Di-
           rectory Service (DDS) function of Message Router. Each Dig-
           ital user sending and receiving mail to and from IBM users
           must be registered in DDS and assigned an "alias" or vir-
           tual address for the PROFS network. Limited one way message
           transfer from MAILbus to IBM is possible without user reg-
           istration in DDS. The recipient (addressee) list of a sin-
           gle message and stored distribution lists can include both
           Digital and IBM users. Delivery Confirmation and Non-Delivery
           Notification messages are supported.

           During MRP configuration, a number of options for message
           content conversion may be chosen. To preserve maximum re-
           visable content, documents from the Digital network can be
           converted to IBM's DCA Revisable Format. Where users of IBM
           systems only have access to simple text editors, conversions
           of all messages and documents can be made to PROFS Note for-
           mat. This option is available on a per destination PROFS node
           basis and should also be chosen to support the sending of
           CMS Notes to IBM VM systems where PROFS has not been installed.
           Digital text messages with one or more attached text doc-
           uments are concatenated into a single document for trans-
           fer to the PROFS network. Not all attachments to mixed con-
           tent messages will be sent to PROFS.

           Binary non-text file types, identified in the Digital net-
           work as DECbodypart 7 (FOREIGN) or DECbodypart 11 (MS-DOS),
           will be transferred unconverted to the IBM PROFS network.
           Such files sent from a Digital to an IBM PROFS network will
           lose their Digital RMS attributes. This binary file trans-
           fer capability is primarily intended for the transfer of MS-DOS
           files between the Digital and IBM networks. Files tagged as
           DCA RFT files (for example, a document created on a PC based



                                       2

           word processing system) can be identified in the PROFS net-
           work as a DCA document. Not all Digital User Agents and Gate-
           ways can append these tags to DECbodypart 7 or DECbodypart
           11 files. Only one binary file may be passed to the IBM en-
           vironment at a time; any attachments to these files will be
           lost. These conversion options are chosen during MRP con-
           figuration.

           Content and identity conversions for Digital to IBM trans-
           fers are summarized in the following table. Conversions op-
           tions are chosen on a per PROFS destination node basis; for
           example, all messages to users on a particular PROFS sys-
           tem will have the selected conversions performed on them.

           ALL-IN-1 Integrated Office System can automatically convert
           DECdx format to WPS-PLUS format. Other Digital user agents
           and MAILbus Gateways can convert DECdx format to a format
           appropriate to their function. Since the capabilities of each
           vendor's word processing systems are not identical and some
           control information is not transmitted, not all attributes
           and functions are converted. The MRP product documentation
           lists the restrictions. Users are responsible for understand-
           ing the capabilities of destination systems when sending bi-
           nary files. Binary file transfer should not be used with ALL-IN-1
           Integrated Office System, Version 2.2 or earlier nor with
           VMSmail Personal Mail Utility of the VMS Operating System,
           Version 5.1 or earlier.

           A single MRP installation will support messaging services
           between an SNA based network of IBM PROFS systems and a MAIL-
           bus network of Digital VMS systems and between the PROFS net-
           work and any other messaging network connected to that MAIL-
           bus network. Service levels obtained in this latter case will
           depend on the characteristics of the other network.

           To provide connection to MAILbus, the VAX Message Router soft-
           ware is required by and included with the software license
           and media kit for VAX Message Router/P Gateway.

           INSTALLATION

           MRP forms only one part of a distributed multi-vendor elec-
           tronic messaging application. Important activities such as
           coordination with other messaging components, modification
           of the IBM system parameters, and the creation or update of
           subscriber entries in the directory service must precede the
           installation of this product. Digital offers a number of ser-
           vices to assist customers with these tasks. Refer to the SOFT-
           WARE PRODUCT SERVICES section for more information.
