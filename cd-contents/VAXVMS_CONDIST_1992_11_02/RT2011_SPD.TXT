     PRODUCT NAME:   DECrouter 250, Version 1.1          SPD 32.15.02

     DESCRIPTION

     The DECrouter 250 software is a communications product that
     provides an asynchronous/synchronous routing service for the
     Local Area Network (LAN). This allows DECnet nodes running DDCMP
     to communicate with nodes on an Ethernet/802.3 LAN and allows
     DECnet DDCMP nodes on an Ethernet/802.3 LAN to communicate with
     nodes outside the LAN within a Wide Area Network (WAN).

     Overview

     The DECrouter 250 software provides access to and from Phase
     IV/IV+ DECnet nodes on a LAN and Phase III or Phase IV/IV+
     DECnet nodes over asynchronous/synchronous lines. These nodes
     can be located either locally via dedicated wiring, or remotely
     via modem connections. Note that LAN refers to any Local Area
     Network that conforms to IEEE 802.3, or ISO 8802/3 standards.

     The DECrouter 250 software runs on the DECrouter 250 (DSRVR)
     and the DEC WANserver 150 (DSRVJ) hardware units. These con-
     tain an Ethernet interface port (IEEE 802.3 compatible). The
     DECrouter 250 hardware has eight asynchronous/synchronous se-
     rial communications ports, and the DEC WANserver 150 has two
     asynchronous/synchronous serial communications ports.

     The DECrouter 250 software performs adaptive routing utilizing
     all of the asynchronous/synchronous lines and the Ethernet/802.3
     ports of the hardware. In the case where communications to an
     end node might pass through multiple routers, the DECrouter 250
     software has the capability of choosing the least cost path or
     re-routing in case of a line failure.

     DECrouter 250, Version 1.1                          SPD 32.15.02



     The DECrouter 250 software supports intra-area (Level 1) and
     inter-area (Level 2) routing of messages between DECnet nodes.
     These nodes can be Phase III/IV/IV+ routing nodes or end nodes.
     Use of this software offloads routing-related communications
     from hosts that would otherwise serve as routing nodes on the
     Local Area Network-based DECnet LAN.

     A major security feature of the DECrouter 250 software is sup-
     port for modem dial-back. This feature allows network managers
     tighter control over access to their DECnet networks.

     The DECrouter 250 software must be downline loaded onto the
     DECrouter 250 or DEC WANserver 150 hardware units over the
     Ethernet/802.3 port or the serial communications ports.

     Routing and DECnet Phase IV Areas

     The DECrouter 250 software implements Phase IV/IV+ DECnet DDCMP
     routing and network management. Phase IV/IV+ DECnet networks are
     hierarchical networks that can be segmented into up to 63 areas,
     each containing up to 1023 nodes.

     Routers can be one of two types; Level 1 or Level 2. Level 1
     Routers route directly toward nodes within their own area, and
     route toward a Level 2 Router when the destination node is in a
     different area. Level 2 Routers act as Level 1 Routers within
     their own area, but in addition, route to other areas.

     The DECrouter 250 software supports both the intra-area rout-
     ing (Level 1) and inter-area routing (Level 2) for Phase IV/IV+
     nodes on a Local Area Network, or Phase III/IV/IV+ remote nodes
     connected to one of the asynchronous/synchronous serial communi-
     cations ports.

     Line Support

     The DECrouter 250 software uses the DECrouter 250 or DEC
     WANserver 150 hardware serial communications ports to connect
     nodes running asynchronous or synchronous DDCMP DECnet, and the
     Ethernet/802.3 ports to connect to the Ethernet/802.3 LAN. The

     asynchronous/synchronous ports operate in full-duplex, point-to-
     point mode and support the ability to connect manually dialed or
     auto-answered modems. The asynchronous/synchronous ports have
     been designed to be compatible with modems conforming to Bell
     standards and CCITT recommendations. Note that multipoint lines
     or connections to DMC11s are not supported.

     Refer to the System Support Addendum (SSA 32.15.02-x) for fur-
     ther information on supported modems.

     The DECrouter 250 (DSRVR) hardware has two high speed serial
     ports and six low speed serial ports. The DEC WANserver 150
     hardware has one high speed serial port and one low speed se-
     rial port. The low speed ports operate at up to 19.2 Kbps, and
     conform to CCITT V.28/V.24 (EIA-232-D). The high speed ports
     operate at speeds up to 64 Kbps and support CCITT V.36/V.11
     (EIA-449/422), CCITT V.10 (EIA-449/423), CCITT V.35 Appendix A,
     as well as CCITT V.28/V.24 (EIA-232-D). In asynchronous mode all
     ports operate at 19.2 Kbps maximum.

     The DECrouter 250 software with the DECrouter 250 hardware
     supports eight lines at speeds and configurations of 2x64 Kbps,
     or 1x64 Kbps and 4x9.6 Kbps, or 8x19.2 Kbps.

     The DECrouter 250 software with the DEC WANserver 150 hardware
     unit supports two lines at speeds and configurations of 1x64
     Kbps and 1x9.6 Kbps, or 2x19.2 Kbps.

     Adapter cables provide the necessary interchange circuits for
     the high speed ports. Refer to the System Support Addendum (SSA
     32.15.02-x) for further information on the required adapter
     cables.

     Installation and Configuration

     The DECrouter 250 software is installed and configured on a VMS,
     ULTRIX (VAX or RISC), or MS-DOS[R]/PC-DOS system (termed a load
     host).

                                     3

 


     DECrouter 250, Version 1.1                          SPD 32.15.02



     The appropriate DECrouter system image is downline loaded from
     the load host into the memory of the DECrouter 250 or DEC
     WANserver 150 hardware units. This system image can be down-
     line loaded over the serial communications ports, as well as
     the Ethernet/802.3 ports. It should be noted, however, that
     some load hosts will not support downline loading over serial
     communications ports.

     To identify which devices on a load host will provide support
     for serial-line loading, refer to the corresponding DECnet
     Software Product Description for that host. (DECnet-VAX SPD
     25.03.xx and DECnet-ULTRIX SPD 26.83.xx.)

     Each DECrouter 250 and DEC WANserver 150 hardware unit will have
     a separate system image on a load host.

     The DECrouter 250 software contains the configuration infor-
     mation that tailors the dedicated router system for proper
     operation in its intended environment.

     The configuration information contained in the system image
     on the load host can be modified by the System/Network Manager
     using a utility provided on the installation kit. The changes
     made to the configuration information in the system image are
     retained until the configuration utility is used to modify those
     changes. The changes take effect the next time the system image
     is downline loaded to the DECrouter 250 or DEC WANserver 150
     hardware.

     Network and Configuration Management

     The Network Management Utility (DECnet Network Control Program
     (NCP)) on Phase IV DECnet hosts can execute commands remotely
     with the DECrouter 250 software to perform three primary func-
     tions:

     o  Display statistical and error information for the router (for
        example, statistics on line usage or errors)

                                     4

 


     DECrouter 250, Version 1.1                          SPD 32.15.02



     o  Control the operation of the router (for example, starting
        and stopping lines, setting parameters, and loading software)

     o  Test the components of the network (for example, loop mes-
        sages through all or part of a communications path to isolate
        a defective component)

     The DECrouter 250 software also has a monitor that is avail-
     able both locally and remotely. The remote monitor runs on
     VMS, ULTRIX (VAX or RISC), and MS-DOS/PC-DOS host systems to
     monitor the current state of the router. These displays are up-
     dated at pre-set intervals and present current router data and
     status information such as CPU and line utilizations, current
     adjacencies, and buffer use.

     Path Splitting

     If the costs are set appropriately, the DECrouter 250 soft-
     ware performs path splitting. Note that routing cost is an
     arbitrary network management parameter set by the network man-
     ager to control network traffic flow. If the cost between the
     router and the destination node is the same on multiple asyn-
     chronous/synchronous ports, up to a maximum of four circuits,
     then the DECrouter 250 software splits traffic across the ports.
     As a result, higher data transfer rates and higher reliability
     due to redundant paths are provided.

     It should be noted that for this path splitting feature to work,
     the destination nodes must support out-of-order packet caching.

     Performance

     The DECrouter 250 software will support and saturate the fol-
     lowing serial line speeds and configurations with minimum size
     DECnet packets:

     o  On DECrouter 250 hardware: 2x64 Kbps, or 1x64 Kbps and 4x9.6
        Kbps, or 8x19.2 Kbps
