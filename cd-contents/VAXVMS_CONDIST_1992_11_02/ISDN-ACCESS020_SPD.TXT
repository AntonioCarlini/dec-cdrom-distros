 PRODUCT NAME:  VAX ISDN ACCESS, Version 2.0            SPD 31.24.02

 DESCRIPTION

 VAX ISDN ACCESS allows suitably configured DECnet -VAX nodes in a DEC-
 net network to remotely control connections to an ISDN network at a
 DECnet node that is physically connected to the ISDN network running
 the VAX ISDN software. This type of node is called an ISDN connector
 node.

 The ISDN connector node is a DECnet-VAX node physically connected to
 a supported ISDN network via a Basic Rate Access (DEC ISDNcontroller
 100/DIV32) and running both VAX ISDN software and DECnet-VAX software.

 This node must be licensed for and running the VAX ISDN software. Re-
 fer to the VAX ISDN Software Product Description (SPD 31.23.xx) as well
 as the DECnet-VAX, either end-node or full-function, Software Prod-
 uct Description (SPD 25.03.xx).

 VAX ISDN ACCESS also provides the ability to establish and control ISDN
 connections by the use of VMS DCL commands. Three new DCL commands are
 added to the DCL tables: ISDN CALL, ISDN CLEAR and ISDN SHOW CALLS.

 Using these commands, any user may request the automatic establish-
 ment of an ISDN connection and clear it without having to know spe-
 cific parameters of the physical unit that will be used. Before hav-
 ing these commands fully operational on the VMS system, the system or
 network manager must configure some tables as described in the chap-
 ter "Call Management Software" of the Management Guide.

 Digital recommends that a customer's first purchase of this software
 include Digital Installation Services. These services provide for in-
 stallation of the software product by an experienced Digital Software
 Specialist.

 Customer Responsibility

 Before installation of the software, the customer must:

 o  Previously have installed all prerequisite software and hardware,
    including terminals.

 o  Deinstall any version of the VAX ISDN or VAX ISDN ACCESS software
    previously installed, using the desinstallation procedure provided
    with the kit.

 During installation, the appropriate kit (Phase IV or Phase V) is au-
 tomatically selected from the VAX ISDN distribution media depending
 on the DECnet-VAX version running at that time on the system. However,
 if the system is upgraded with DECnet-VAX Version 5.4 Extensions later,
 the VAX-ISDN kit will have to be re-installed.

 Digital's Installation Services, if purchased, also require that the
 customer must:

 o  Make available for a reasonable period of time, as mutually agreed
    by Digital and the customer, all hardware, communication facili-
    ties and terminals that are to be used during installation.
