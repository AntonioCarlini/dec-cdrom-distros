 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC PrintServer Supporting Host         SPD 27.68.08
                Software for VMS[*], Version 4.1

 DESCRIPTION

 The DEC PrintServer Supporting Host Software for VMS is a VMS layered
 product that enables suitably configured VMS systems within an Eth-
 ernet local area network to boot and provide support functions for the
 PrintServer 20, turbo PrintServer 20, PrintServer 32, PrintServer 40,
 and PrintServer 40 Plus.

 The Supporting Host software consists of the following components:

 o  A primary boot image which is downline loaded into the PrintServer
    upon receipt of a boot request. It continues the boot process and
    becomes the "loader" for the remaining components.

 o  A management component which includes support via DECnet for PrintServer
    configuration files, downline loading of secondary boot files, and
    remote storage of event log and accounting files.

 o  A console component which allows management and monitoring of a printer
    from a terminal on the supporting host system or from the local con-
    sole terminal for a PrintServer 40 or PrintServer 40 Plus.

 o  A PrintServer component which is downline loaded into the PrintServer.
    It includes DECnet and Internet distribution services, remote con-
    sole services (also local console client for the PrintServer 40 and
    PrintServer 40 Plus and local panel services for the PrintServer
    20, turbo PrintServer 20, and PrintServer 32), and the PostScript®
    interpreter. The interpreter processes PostScript commands and gen-
    erates imaging data for the printer controller.

 ____________________

 The   terms OpenVMS and VMS refer to the OpenVMS operating system.

                               DIGITAL                September 1992

                                                         AE-HL89J-TE

 

 If multiple PrintServers reside within the local area network, the same
 number of Supporting Hosts may be used to load and manage them. Al-
 ternatively, the load and management operations can be consolidated
 onto any number of suitably configured supporting hosts which would
 perform these operations for all PrintServers on the local area net-
 work.

 In a VMS environment, DECprint Printing Services for VMS (SPD 32.41.xx)
 is the companion product. In an ULTRIX environment, the ULTRIX Oper-
 ating System includes the PrintServer Client functionality. Refer to
 the System Support Addendum (SSA 27.68.07-x) for availability and re-
 quired versions of prerequisite/optional software.

 The client software must reside on each system that either wants to
 print directly to the PrintServer or provide distributed printing ser-
 vices for other systems printing indirectly or spooling. A system run-
 ning the client software can transmit print requests to any suitably
 configured PrintServer on the network that is defined in its network
 database. The maximum number of print clients that can simultaneously
 be connected to a PrintServer 20, turbo PrintServer 20, PrintServer
 32, or PrintServer 40 Plus is sixteen; on the PrintServer 40, the max-
 imum is twelve.

 Features

 PostScript

 The PostScript language's page description capabilities include the
 following features, which may be used in any combination:

 o  Arbitrary shapes constructed from straight lines, arcs, and cubic
    curves; such shapes may self-intersect and contain disconnected sec-
    tions and holes.

 o  Painting primitives that permit a shape to be outlined with lines
    of any thickness, filled with any gray shade, or used as a clip-
    ping path to crop any other graphics.

 o  Text fully integrated with graphics. Text characters are treated
    as graphical shapes that may be operated on by any PostScript graph-
    ics operator.

                                  2

 

 o  Sampled images derived from natural sources or generated synthet-
    ically. The PostScript graphics model allows sampled images at any
    resolution and with a variety of dynamic ranges, and it provides
    a number of facilities to control the rendering of images on the
    PrintServer.

 o  A general coordinate system facility that supports all combinations
    of linear transformations including translation, scaling, rotation,
    reflection, and skewing. These transformations apply uniformly to
    all elements of a page description, including text, graphical shapes,
    and sampled images.

 o  A rendering algorithm, DECimage, which enhances the quality of nat-
    ural (halftone) images when printed on laser printers.

 PrintServer Console Clients

 PrintServer console clients are available for all PrintServers through
 a command-line interface at terminals on the Supporting Host or at the
 local PrintServer consoles for the PrintServer 40 and PrintServer 40
 Plus. The console services enable the system manager to monitor the
 status of the PrintServer. There are two types of console functions,
 privileged and unprivileged. To access the privileged functions, a pass-
 word must be entered.

 Unprivileged console functions include:

 _________between_print_jobs________________________________________

 In addition, the PrintServer 20, turbo PrintServer 20, and PrintServer
 32 have a front panel with a 2x24 LED display which provides PrintServer
 information. The front panel status messages can be displayed in En-
 glish, French, German, Dutch, Swedish, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian,
 or Norwegian.

 Centralized Event Logging

                                  4

 

 The types of events that are logged by the PrintServer range from suc-
 cessful completion of jobs to fatal errors. These events can option-
 ally be displayed on remote console terminals and are always displayed
 on the local console of the PrintServer 40 and PrintServer 40 Plus;
 a small subset of similar event messages are displayed on the front
 panel of the PrintServer 20, turbo PrintServer 20, and PrintServer 32.
 Events can also be recorded in an event log file on the Supporting Host.
 A separate event log file is maintained for each PrintServer managed
 by the Supporting Host software. The PrintServer communicates with the
 management client component running on the supporting host, which in
 turn, writes to the event log. Each PrintServer can send the logging
 data to multiple supporting hosts that request this data.

 Centralized Accounting

 The PrintServer's accounting utility provides the system manager with
 a convenient way to monitor all access of a PrintServer and to bill
 for printer usage. As with event logging data, accounting information
 can be sent to multiple Supporting Host systems on the network.

 The accounting utility is provided to prepare each PrintServer's us-
 age report on a per-user basis. Information captured includes user-
 name (including client system), total number of sheets/sides printed,
 accounting by tray, and PostScript CPU time used (in seconds). In ad-
 dition, the system manager can specify cost (per sheet, per side, and
 /or per seconds of CPU time); the utility also allows for accounting
 to begin from a specific date.

 Controlled Access to a PrintServer

 The PrintServer's client access feature provides the system manager
 with a convenient way to control all access to a PrintServer. Print-
 ing restrictions to a PrintServer are specified by either "allowing"
 or "denying" access to a PrintServer. The allow command adds DECnet
 area numbers or node addresses and Internet addresses, networks, or
 subnet numbers to the list of nodes or areas that are allowed to com-
 municate with the PrintServer system. The deny command adds DECnet area



                                  5

 

 numbers or node addresses and Internet addresses, networks, or sub-
 net numbers to the list of nodes or areas that are not allowed to com-
 municate with the PrintServer system. Access restriction applies not
 only to print clients, but to management and console clients as well.

 Downline Loading the PrintServer Image

 The Supporting Host Software downline loads the PrintServer primary
 image upon receipt of a load request from a PrintServer. In the event
 multiple systems on the Ethernet are running the Supporting Host Soft-
 ware (and are enabled to service boot requests), the first system to
 respond to a PrintServer's load request will downline load the PrintServer
 primary image. The management client provides configuration and ad-
 ministrative services as well as secondary image loading.

 For users requiring DECnet or DECnet and Internet access, the MOP boot-
 ing protocol is required from either the VMS or ULTRIX supporting host.

 PrintServer Component

 The PrintServer Component is the software that is downline loaded to
 and runs in the PrintServer.

 This software consists of the following parts:

 o  Distribution Software accepts print and control data from DECnet
    or Internet print client systems or a supporting host on the net-
    work and passes the data to the imaging software (PostScript in-
    terpreter). The distribution software also passes system messages
    from the imaging software to the appropriate print client or man-
    agement client and provides console client services.

 o  Imaging Software which interprets data from the Distribution Soft-
    ware, builds the corresponding bitmaps, and sends those bitmaps to
    the print engine to be converted to printed output.

    The Imaging Software also passes any system messages from the print
    engine or interpreter to the Distribution Software, which passes
    the information to the appropriate print, console, and/or manage-
    ment client running on a Supporting Host system.

                                  6

 

    The Imaging Software includes an interpreter based on Adobe®'s PostScript

 OPTIONAL SOFTWARE

 ALL-IN-1 Scripts

 This unsupported option provides a collection of ALL-IN-1 Scripts and
 a WPS-PLUS Printer Table file that enhance compatibility between ALL-IN-1,
 WPS-PLUS, and Digital PostScript printers. ALL-IN-1/WPS-PLUS users can
 access the many unique features of these printers; these include sup-
 port for duplex printing, number_up, landscape page orientation, print-
 ing of multiple paper sizes, and sheet_count. PrintServer performance
 is greatly improved for ALL-IN-1 multiple selection and print oper-
 ations. Support for LN03 font cartridge emulation (via DECprint Print-
 ing Services for VMS or Third Party) is also included.

 ANSI Device Control (Set-Up) Module

 SYS$EXAMPLES includes an unsupported sample ANSI device control li-
 brary that can be installed on the system and will allow system users
 to control the features of DEClaser and LN03 printers from the print
 command. This feature allows users to select simplex/duplex, landscape
 /portrait, paper sizes, envelopes, and input trays by location.

 PostScript Compatibility Module

 SYS$EXAMPLES includes an unsupported sample PostScript setup file for
 emulating many PostScript extensions. The use of this file allows the
 correct emulation and printing of PostScript extensions found in other
 PostScript devices (e.g., Apple® LaserWriter®).
