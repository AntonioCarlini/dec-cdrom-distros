           DESCRIPTION

           System Overview

           MIRA AS systems are High Availability systems based on a dual
           host architecture plus watchdog modules installed in each
           computer and communicating via a dedicated link.

           DEC High Availability Management Software (DEC HAMS) con-
           trols MIRA AS systems, handling the following main tasks:

           o  Error detection at system level as well as at device level
              provided that device errors are logged/recorded by their
              associated driver

           o  Application failover and recovery initiation upon error
              detection and in accordance with user-configured action
              templates

           The complete application recovery (regain the lost process
           context) must be accomplished by the application itself. Pro-
           cess/context shadowing is not a feature of DEC HAMS.

           Before running an application, the user must configure the
           system environment and error recovery strategy. This should
           be done on both computers and consists of filling in tem-
           plates associating the devices dedicated to the application,
           and the actions to be taken in the event of device failure.

           The two computers of a MIRA AS system operate independently.
           DEC HAMS is installed on each computer and handles connected
           applications so a complete failover is decided only if ab-
           solutely necessary, thus increasing the system availabil-
           ity.

           DEC High Availability Management            SPD 31.86.01
           Software for VMS, Version 1.2

           When detecting a device failure which does not impact the
           whole functionality of one computer and provided the user
           has filled in the action tables accordingly, DEC HAMS is able
           to decide the failover of only those applications associ-
           ated with this failed device. The unaffected applications
           are kept running on the current computer.

           MIRA AS systems provide a hardware and software environment
           required to create high availability applications, which can
           recover from failure without operator intervention.

           MIRA AS systems are suited to dedicated control applications,
           allowing very short breaks of system availability which do
           not affect its overall integrity during the service/maintenance
           /replacement of the failed component.

           Terminology

           LOCAL System - System currently operating or executing com-
           mands.

           REMOTE System - System at the other end of the watchdog link.

           MASTER Application - Application running on any of the two
           computers with a backup application declared in STANDBY mode
           on the other computer.

           MASTER BACKUP Application - Application, formerly in STANDBY
           mode which became MASTER after the failure of its partner
           on the remote system.

           SYSTEM Failure - Failure affecting the integrity of the whole
           system which is not recoverable by the application result-
           ing in a SYSTEM FAILOVER.

           NON-SYSTEM Failure - Failure affecting a specific device and
           /or its associated application(s). Recovery depends on cus-
           tomer needs and may result in APPLICATION FAILOVER (all or
           part).

           Software for VMS, Version 1.2

           DEC HAMS is installed on each computer and exchanges sta-
           tus messages via the dedicated watchdog link.

           o  System Failure

              If the software on either computer is unable to exchange
              messages within a user-specified period or detects a sys-
              tem failure, a system failover occurs on the computer still
              in operation.

           o  Non-System Failure

              Once a device error threshold has been reached or when-
              ever a MIRA AS application fails, a non-system error is
              generated. If the software on either computer sends a mes-
              sage with application or application device failure state,
              application failover or system failover occurs on the re-
              mote computer.

           Failover Operation

           In the event of system failover, the following automatically
           occurs on the computer still operating:

           o  All the applications in STANDBY mode acquire the MASTER
              BACKUP state, thus initiating application(s) recovery.

           o  All the applications in MASTER mode keep the MASTER state.

           The following automatically occurs on the failed computer:

           o  If the feature known as "DCLOW" is enabled, a power fail
              is simulated thus speeding up the release of the dual-
              port disks mounted so they can be mounted on the other
              system (e.g., RA type disks).

           In the event of application failover, the local application
           is aborted. The partner application on the remote computer,
           in STANDBY mode, acquires the MASTER BACKUP state, thus ini-
           tiating the application recovery.

               HAMS driven    |   Application driven

           DEC HAMS can perform failover, plus application recovery ini-
           tialization, in less than a few seconds on normally loaded
           systems.

           On-line Testing

           On-line tests can be invoked by the operator to test the spe-
           cific MIRA AS hardware on a system. Tests can be used with-
           out disturbing the applications running on either computer.

           Diagnostics

           MDM Diagnostics must be run on the faulty computer. In case
           of partial system failure, the user has to provoke a com-
           plete system failover by using an operator command. Diag-
           nostics and repair can then be done normally on the faulty
           system without affecting the applications running on the com-
           puter still in operation.

           Re-start

           Once a failed computer is repaired and restarted:

           o  Local applications having a remote partner application
              in master backup state acquire the master state.

           o  The remote partner application in master backup mode ac-
              quires the standby state.

           o  The local application having a remote partner applica-
              tion in master state acquires the standby state.

           o  The remote application in master state keeps the master
              state.

           Thus, the user-configured load sharing mode will be re-established.

           Swap Operation

           A user application or the operator can command SYSTEM or AP-
           PLICATION SWAP. This operation can be disabled by an appli-
           cation. It is only valid from a local application in mas-
           ter state and with a remote partner application in standby
           state.

           In the event of SYSTEM SWAP, on both computers:

           o  All the applications in standby state acquire the mas-
              ter state.

           o  All the applications in master state acquire the standby
              state.

           o  All the applications in master backup state keep this state.

           In the event of APPLICATION SWAP:

           o  The local application in master/standby state acquires
              the standby/master state.

           o  The remote partner application in standby/master state
              acquires the master/standby state.

           APPLICATION SWAP gives load sharing possibilities and al-
           lows use of 100 percent of the available CPU resource of the
           MIRA AS system.

           User Application Interface

           The User Application Interface provides a set of user-callable
           subroutines allowing exchange of information via DEC HAMS.
           DEC HAMS must be active on each computer.

           These subroutines comply with the VMS Standard for Proce-
           dure Calling and Condition Handling and are supported for
           VAX Pascal, VAX MACRO, VAX Ada, VAX BASIC, VAX COBOL, VAX
           BLISS-32, VAX PL/1, VAX C and VAX FORTRAN and include the
           following functions:

           HAMS$CONNECT      Connects the user application (maximum
                             16 simultaneous connections supported)

           HAMS$DISCONNECT   Disconnects the user application

           HAMS$SWAP         Swaps MASTER and STANDBY applications

           HAMS$FAILOVER     Forces application failover

           HAMS$DISABLE_     Disables Application Swap Operations
           SWAP

           HAMS$ENABLE_      Enables Application Swap Operations
           SWAP

           HAMS$GET_EVENT    Gets DEC HAMS event status

           If requested, the user applications can also be notified of
           changes in application status and invoke the necessary re-
           covery procedures.

           Clock Synchronization

           The two computer clocks can be synchronized within a few mil-
           liseconds. This optional feature may be managed automati-
           cally by DEC HAMS.
