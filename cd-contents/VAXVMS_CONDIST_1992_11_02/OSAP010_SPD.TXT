PRODUCT NAME: DECosap/VMS V1.0                                    SPD 32.75.00


DECosap (Digital's Omni Services for Sinec (1) AP ).

(1) Sinec is a trademark of Siemens.

DECosap/VMS is a network communication product. It is an implementation of the
SIEMENS Sinec AP (Automation Protocol).
Sinec AP is the application-to-application protocol developed by SIEMENS on
top of the ISO standard Transport layer. SINEC-AP specifies SIEMENS
proprietary Session, Presentation and Application layers. 

Combined with prerequisite hardware and software, DECosap/VMS V1.0 is a
strategic product that will allow transparent communication between
application running on VAX/VMS systems and those running on SIEMENS hardware
which support the SINEC-AP protocol tower. 

DECosap/VMS V1.0 is a VMS layered product. 

The conformance of DECosap/VMS V1.0 software to the Sinec AP specification
is detailed in the Appendix A of this SPD. 


FEATURES

DECosap/VMS V1.0 is an implementation of the Siemens Sinec AP protocol on the
VMS environment. Sinec AP specifies the semantics and syntax for
communications between applications running on a VMS system and application
running on dedicated factory floor processors, such as robots, programmable
controllers, numeric controllers, pcs. 
The DECosap/VMS V1.0 product will provide the Sinec AP Application,
Presentation and Session layers. 
The transport implementation is shipped as VOTS (VAX OSI TRANSPORT SERVICE)
and provides support for class 0 and class 4 transport. Note that the VOTS
programming interface is not a supported part of the DECosap/VMS V1.0.

Although the messages that the SINEC-AP devices exchange over the Transport
layer are in a proprietary format and open systems cannot interpret them, the
SINEC-AP application layer specification is based on Manufacturing Message
Specification (MMS) Service definition ISO/IEC 9506-1. For this reason the
DECosap/VMS V1.0 will be layered on the DEComni/VMS product which provides
an implementation of MMS. Refer to DEComni SPD (32.32.00) for more information. 

In particular the applications programming interface (API) will be the
one provided by DEComni/VMS V1.0.

DECosap/VMS V1.0 is implementing a subset of the overall Sinec AP services.

COMPONENTS


OSAPCL:

The OSAPCL facility allows the user to configure and manage the addressing
information that is required by the SINEC-AP protocol. It consists of a
command language interpreter which parses and implements a limited set of
commands. 


DECosap Services:

This component contains a runtime library which is the implementation
of AP Technological Functions (TFs) and AP Monitor services.  
These services can be called by using the DEComni API.
The actual support for services (TFS)  is listed in the appendix A of this
SPD. Service classes supported are in the following categories: 

- Open (functionally compatible with MMS) services: 
  Environment, VMD Support, and Variables Access services. 
- Not Open services (compatible with MMS): Serial Transfer services.

For configuration and management purpose DECosap/VMS V1.0  will use the
DEComni facilities ODF, OMNICL, OMNIVIEW. 

VOTS:

It provides the Network and Transport layer of ISO/OSI stack. It will be 
packaged with the DECosap/VMS V1.0 product.

DECosap/VMS V1.0 Installation Verification Procedure (IVP):

The DECosap/VMS IVP performs a series of tests to verify proper installation. 


DOCUMENTATION

The DECosap/VMS V1.0 documentation set consists of:

DECosap/VMS User's Guide - Provides an overview of AP concepts and terminology
and an introduction to DECosap procedure calls via DEComni/VMS API and
DECosap/VMS operations and features. It also describes the use of the DEComni
utilities OMNICL and ODF.

DECosap/VMS Software Installation Guide - Explains how to prepare for DECosap
installation, how to install the product, and what to do after DECosap is
installed. 




INSTALLATION

Only experienced customers should attempt installation of this product.
DIGITAL recommends that all other customers purchase DIGITAL's Installation
Services. These services provide for installation of the software product by
an experienced DIGITAL Software Specialist. 

Installation for DECosap/VMS will consist of the following: 

	o  Verification that all components of DECosap/VMS have been
           received. 

	o  Verification that the necessary versions of the prerequisite
           software and documentation are available. 

	o  Verification of the appropriate system parameters. 

Note: Should a software specialist be required to modify the 
previously installed operating system parameters, a time 
and materials charge will apply.

	o  Verification that system meets the minimum hardware and software 
           requirements (as specified in the SPD).

	o  Customer making available for a reasonable period of time,
           as mutually agreed upon by DIGITAL and the customer, all
           hardware communication facilities and terminals that are to
           be used during installation. 

	o  Install the DECosap/VMS software by creating the necessary 
           directories and by copying the software from the distribution
           media.

	o  Verify the proper installation of DECosap/VMS by using the IVP.

Connectivity to all other nodes within the network is the 
responsibility of the customer.

Delays caused by any failure to meet these  responsibilities  will  be
charged at the then prevailing rate for time and materials.

Note 1

VAX F floating point is supported.  The range is .29*10**-38 through
1.7*10**38.
An exponent width of 8 bits is supported.  
A format width of 32 bits is supported.



Note 2

The effective length for strings is limited by the maximum PDU size.

Note 3

Date and Time are supported. 
Support for Time Sequence Identifier is N/A.

Note 4

Read and Write , Message READ , Message Write, Message Exchange indications
are delivered to user written code and thus uninterruptible access is
application dependent. 

Note 5

The range is 1-infinity.  
Acceptance of indications is under programming control.  The actual number
of outstanding requests allowable is dependent upon process memory limits 
which is set by either the programmer or system manager.
