          PRODUCT NAME:  DECmcc WANdesigner, Version 1.0      SPD 32.45.00

          DESCRIPTION

          DECmcc WANdesigner is an interactive VMS layered software prod-
          uct that enables users to design and evaluate wide area networks
          (WANs). With WANdesigner, users can design new WANs or evaluate
          changes to existing ones based on cost considerations, equip-
          ment and application data, and performance requirements. Changes
          to existing networks can be planned in advance and alternative
          designs can be generated for comparison purposes.

          WANdesigner enables users to conduct "what if" analyses on ex-
          isting networks or suggested network designs. For example, users
          can make manual modifications of network components, change
          applications, traffic, or design goals and have WANdesigner com-
          pute the result to analyze the effect of the proposed changes.

          Using a device that supports VAX GKS software, users can dis-
          play and interact with network topology maps. Such maps, with
          WANdesigner's DECforms-based menu interface, enables users to
          describe and map exiting networks, estimate network performance,
          design new networks, and generate reports.

          o  Network Description - Users can describe networks by entering
             site locations, equipment types for nodes at each site,
             wire and circuit speeds, and end-to-end traffic in bits
             per second. Users can read historical traffic data from
             the NMCC/DECnet Monitor data base into WANdesigner network
             descirptions to produce estimates of network usage.

          o  Estimate Performance - Provided with protocol overhead data,
             WANdesigner will check the legality of the overall network
             design, compute utilization of each wire and node, compute
             end-to-end traffic times, and compute relative costs.

          o  Network Design - Based on user-entered data on sites, nodes,
             traffic, cost tables, area assignments, and performance
             goals, WANdesigner will provide an overall network wiring
             plan.

          o  Report Generation - WANdesigner will provide site, node,
             and wire inventory reports, traffic utilization reports,
             statistics on response times and path lengths, generate
             network maps, and compute relative prices.

          Supported network protocols include DECnet Phase IV, DECnet/OSI
          Phase V, and TCP/IP. Users can design mixed DECnet-TCP/IP WANS
          and produce volume-based relative cost estimates for CCITT X.25
          network environments. WANdesigner operates in a DECwindows
          environment under terminal emulation mode. The product uses
          ASCII text for input and output which enables users to prepare
          large network descriptions off line and entered them as script
          files.
