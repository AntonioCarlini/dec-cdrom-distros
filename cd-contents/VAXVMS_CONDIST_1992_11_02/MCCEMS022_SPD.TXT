 31.88.03                Version 2.2

 DESCRIPTION

 DECmcc Enterprise Management Station (DECmcc EMS) is a network man-
 agement software product designed to provide network managers with a
 complete set of applications to manage wide area heterogeneous net-
 works.

 The DECmcc Enterprise Management Station consolidates Digital Equip-
 ment Corporation's network management applications within a DECwin-
 dows environment and provides the capability of running all applica-
 tions on a single system. It consists of products that are compliant
 with Digital's Enterprise Management Architecture (EMA) as well as prod-
 ucts that are not EMA-compliant. As such, DECmcc EMS is a transition
 vehicle to an EMA-compliant product set within a single software prod-
 uct.

 DECmcc EMS consists of the following Digital network management prod-
 ucts:

 o  DECmcc Basic Management System (BMS)

 o  DECmcc Fault Diagnostic Package

 o  DECmcc Extended LAN Management (ELM)

 o  DECmcc Terminal Server Access Module

 o  LAN Traffic Monitor (LTM) OpenVMS[*]

 o  NMCC/VAX ETHERnim

 ____________________

 The   terms OpenVMS and VMS refer to the OpenVMS operating system.

                                                         AE-PAW9D-TE

 

 o  Terminal Server Manager (TSM)

 Several component products, including TSM, DECmcc BMS, DECmcc ELM AM,
 and DECmcc ELM FM have been upgraded within DECmcc EMS V2.2. DECmcc
 Fault Diagnostic Package and DECmcc Terminal Server Access Module are
 new components in this version of DECmcc EMS. NMCC/DECelms, two prod-
 ucts that were historic components of DECmcc EMS, have been removed
 as their capabilities have been superseded by EMA-compliant DECmcc com-
 ponents.

 In addition to containing the products listed above, DECmcc EMS sup-
 ports the ability to install and run other OpenVMS layered products
 within a DECwindows environment. DECmcc EMS also provides access to
 non-Digital management products that are based on X11 standards. These
 products can be installed on the same or separate processors as DECmcc
 EMS for the purpose of consolidating interfaces on a single worksta-
 tion display.

 Also included with the DECmcc EMS components is the Network Troubleshoot-
 ing Guide. Available through the DECwindows Bookreader application,
 the Network Troubleshooting Guide provides DECmcc EMS users with a sys-
 tematic, on-line approach to solving some of the most common problems
 that occur on DECnet-VAX, DECnet-ULTRIX, Ethernet, and TCP/IP networks.

 DECmcc Basic Management System (BMS)

 The DECmcc Basic Management System (BMS) is a complete, prepackaged
 DECmcc Product Family management system for multivendor, multiproto-
 col networks. It provides access to, and management functions for, Dig-
 ital Equipment Corporation's ADVANTAGE-NETWORKS (DECnet Phase IV, DEC-
 net/OSI, and TCP/IP) and open network environments. The DECmcc BMS is
 a modular software product that can be extended through the addition
 of other DECmcc products, third party, or user-developed software mod-
 ules.






                                  2

 

 The DECmcc BMS provides both generic and device-specific management
 functions including:

 o  Graphic and Command Line User Interfaces that provide consistent
    views and interactions with the management system regardless of the
    objects managed or the protocols used to manage them.

 o  Configuration Management functions that include automated discov-
    ery and device registration, topology mapping, and user-defined man-
    agement domains.

 o  Generic Notification and Alarm functions that enable users to de-
    fine alarm rules and set up notification and automated procedures
    to locate existing and potential network problems or events.

 o  Generic Historical Data Recording and Data Export functions that
    allow users to define, collect, time stamp, and re-use historical
    network data, and export DECmcc management information to an ex-
    ternal relational database.

 o  Device-specific Performance Statistics functions for DECnet Phase
    IV and DECnet/OSI nodes, Digital LAN Bridges, and TCP/IP hosts.

    Consistent with the EMA Director Model, of which it is an imple-
    mentation, the DECmcc BMS consists of a set of layered Management
    Modules supported by an open applications program interface (API),
    an Executive or operating system-like set of module support func-
    tions, and an object-oriented Management Information Repository (MIR)
    providing data structure and storage functions.

 o  Management Modules provide services to users and one another. There
    are three types of Management Modules:

    -  Access Modules (AMs) provide remote protocol support for, and
       management information about, different classes of managed ob-
       jects.

    -  Function Modules (FMs) provide services such as object regis-
       tration, statistics generation, fault detection, and notifica-
       tion to users and to one another.

                                  3

 

    -  Presentation Modules (PMs) provide a consistent user interface
       for the direct manipulation of managed objects (through AMs) and
       user access to management operations (through FMs).

 o  The Executive provides system services that enable Management Mod-
    ules to be installed and used independently or in combination.

 o  The Applications Programming Interface (API) defines how Manage-
    ment Modules invoke each other's services. The DECmcc API is open
    and documented to support Digital, third party, or user-developed
    modules.

 o  The Management Information Repository (MIR) provides a means to struc-
    ture and store management information.

 DECmcc BMS Access Modules (AMs)

 DECmcc BMS AMs provide access to network and system objects in Dig-
 ital's ADVANTAGE-NETWORKS and other mixed, multivendor network envi-
 ronments that use the following management protocols: DECnet NICE, DEC-
 net/OSI CMIP, SNMP, and IEEE 802.2/Ethernet/MOP.

 o  The DECnet Phase IV AM enables users to manage DECnet Phase IV ob-
    jects, such as nodes, circuits, lines, and adjacencies. With the
    DECnet Phase IV AM, users can modify DECnet parameters, set char-
    acteristics, collect DECnet events, and poll for management data
    such as counters or status.

 o  The DECnet/OSI CMIP AM provides management access to DECnet devices
    that use Digital's implementation of the standard Common Manage-
    ment Information Protocol (CMIP). This version of CMIP, implemented
    on DECnet/OSI devices, provides management operations and data gath-
    ering functions for DECnet/OSI networks, including the ability to
    sink DECnet events to the DECmcc system.

 o  The TCP/IP SNMP AM includes support for the following Internet Ad-
    visory Board (IAB) Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) RFCs:



                                  4

 

    1155, 1156, 1157, 1212, and 1213. This includes full MIB II sup-
    port, in addition to support for on-site enrollment of vendor-specific
    Enterprise MIBs including:

    -  A MIB translation utility that automatically checks the syntax
       of the ASN.1 Concise MIB definition (providing error messages
       to help identify syntax problems) and translates the data for
       loading the information into the DECmcc Director's Management
       Information Repository (MIR).

    -  An event-logging sink for collecting SNMP generic traps (unso-
       licited TCP/IP event messages) including: coldStart, warmStart,
       linkDown, linkUp, egpNeighborLoss, authentificationFailure, and
       enterpriseSpecific.

    -  Ability to perform GET and SET operations on devices supported
       by SNMP agents.

    -  ICMP ECHO_REQUEST (ping) support for verifying the reachabil-
       ity of an SNMP managed object at the IP level.

    Note: DEC TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS is required for using the TCP
    /IP SNMP AM on OpenVMS systems.

 o  The IEEE 802.3/Ethernet Station AM enables users to manage, at the
    network interface level, any 802.3/Ethernet LAN device that sup-
    ports MOP REQID, MOP SYSID, MOP Counters, Ethernet V2 Loopback, IEEE
    802.2 XID, or IEEE 802.2 Test.

 o  Circuit AM works as a client of management protocol modules to pro-
    vide management of circuits connecting endpoints compliant with the
    Network Management Forum (NMF) definitions. Compliant endpoints in-
    clude DECnet Phase IV and DECnet OSI nodes, and TCP /IP hosts. Ty-
    ing together circuit, line, link, and other endpoint data, this AM
    can gather status data and store reference information about sim-
    ple, point-to-point circuits, or complex multichannel circuits.

 DECmcc BMS Function Modules (FMs)


                                  5

 

 The DECmcc BMS includes generic and device-specific FMs that provide
 a variety of management services to end users and, in combination, to
 one another. These services include configuration management functions,
 fault management functions including alarm and notification services,
 historical data recording and data export functions, and performance
 statistics functions.

 Generic FM services are support for devices accessible through the BMS
 AMs, other Digital-developed AMs, or AMs developed and supported by
 third parties and users.

 DECmcc BMS Configuration Management Functions

 DECmcc BMS Configuration Management functions include both manual and
 automatic registration of managed objects, and support for user-defined
 domains (groups of managed objects). These functions are provided by
 the following DECmcc BMS FMs and services.

 Registration FM
 The Registration FM is a generic FM that enables users to enter and
 manage data identifying each managed object in a network environment.
 Such information includes object instance data such as network names
 and addresses, and reference information such as device location, soft-
 ware revision levels, and contact names.

 With the Registration FM, users have the option of selecting a local,
 system-level repository or setting up a network-wide, globally-available
 naming service using Digital's Distributed Name Service (DECdns). With
 DECdns, users and applications can assign names to resources (such as
 nodes, bridges, files, domain names, etc.) and then use those resources
 without having to keep track of physical location or network address.
 The DECdns option also enables multiple DECmcc systems to share the
 same view of managed objects.

 Domain FM
 The Domain FM is a generic FM that enables users to assign managed ob-
 jects into groups called domains. Domains are subsets of the managed
 object configuration that provide user-defined groups that can be based


                                  6

 

 on equipment type (all DECnet nodes, all TCP/IP hosts, all LAN Bridges,
 etc.), geography (all objects within a LAN, building, campus, or sub-
 net), personnel levels, or any other user-defined object group. Do-
 mains can contain or refer to other domains and can be hierarchical
 or overlapping. Individual managed objects can be contained within mul-
 tiple domains.

 Autoconfiguration Services
 Autoconfiguration services automatically locate, register, and map man-
 aged objects by class. Supported classes include DECnet Phase IV nodes,
 TCP/IP hosts, and Digital FDDI devices, and LAN Bridges. Users can de-
 fine domains for each class, and set network boundaries. The autocon-
 figuration functions can request network instance data from DECnet routers,
 IP gateways, and Bridge spanning trees. As devices are located and man-
 agement information gathered, the functions automatically map them in
 the appropriate user-defined domains and register management data in
 the MIR.

 DECmcc BMS Alarm and Notification Services

 DECmcc BMS alarm and notification services are provided by a combi-
 nation of Management Modules. These modules enable users to create alarm
 rules that can detect existing or potential network problems, and no-
 tification mechanisms for informing users when such problems occur or
 network events happen.

 Alarms FM
 The Alarms FM provides facilities for users to write rule-based ex-
 pressions (alarm rules) that use polled data or unsolicited event mes-
 sages to trigger alarms. Alarm rules can be written for any managed
 object or entity class for which there is corresponding Access Mod-
 ule protocol support (DECnet Phase IV NICE, SNMP, etc.). Alarm rules
 can be based on state changes, simple arithmetic expressions, or oc-
 currences (unsolicited event messages received through the appropri-
 ate Access Module). Alarm rules can be written for individual managed
 objects or wildcarding can be used to apply rules to all objects in
 a domain for a given object class.



                                  7

 

 In addition to the standard DECmcc BMS notification functions described
 below, the Alarms FM allows for the execution of user-written command
 procedures. Such command procedures can be used to generate terminal
 broadcast or electronic mail messages, or automated procedures that
 a network manager or operator might implement when a particular alarm
 condition occurs.

 In combination with the Performance Analysis FM described below, the
 alarm functions can be used to create threshold alarms based on per-
 formance statistics for DECnet Nodes, TCP/IP hosts, or Digital LAN Bridges.
 In this way, alarm rules allow users to detect potential problems be-
 fore they become major network faults.

 Notification FM and PM
 The Notification FM and PM enable users to define the mechanisms used
 to alert operators when a particular network or system event has oc-
 curred. The functions recognize two types of events: configuration events,
 which are reported by a managed object or DECmcc Management Module;
 and alarm events, which are generated by the Alarms FM whenever a rule
 fires or encounters an error (i.e., an exception to the rule).

 When an event occurs, the DECwindow/Iconic Map PM displays a color change
 on the appropriate object icon and a message in the Notification win-
 dow. Users can define the severity levels and select colors appropri-
 ate to the problem level. DECmcc Notification also enables users to
 customize event collection and storage in the following ways:

 o  Logging: logging can be used to store received events to disk. Log
    files are automatically created and purged based on user-definable
    arguments.

 o  Filter: users can filter received events based on the following cri-
    teria: managed object, domain, severity level, message text, or event
    /alarm type.

 o  Target: Notifications (icon color changes) can be redirected from
    the object that generates the event to the object that is the sub-
    ject of the event.


                                  8

 

 o  Search: users can search received notifications based on the fol-
    lowing criteria: any field, severity level, notification identi-
    fier, name or address, text description, time stamp, or domain name.

 o  View: users can display a Real-time Graph of the number of noti-
    fications being displayed, collected and filtered; histogram of all
    notifications grouped by severity level; and the maximum notifi-
    cation buffer size.

 o  Change default start-up: users can assign customized colors to the
    six notification severity levels.

 Data Collector AM
 The Data Collector AM enables users to collect events from objects not
 directly managed by DECmcc. Users can create customized icons for any
 object not directly managed by DECmcc and include it in the Iconic Map.
 The Data Collector AM provides a programming interface and a command
 script interface. The programming interface allows users to include
 code in any application program to send events to DECmcc for display
 in the Iconic Map or Notification window. The command script inter-
 face enables users to use OpenVMS DCL command procedures or ULTRIX shell
 scripts to send events to DECmcc for display in the Iconic Map or No-
 tification window.

 Historical Data Collection and Data Export

 Historical Data Collection and Data Export functions are provided by
 the Historian and Export FMs. These generic FMs enable users to col-
 lect, time stamp, and store network data for use by other DECmcc FMs
 (such as the Performance Analyzer FM), and export data to external re-
 lational databases for addition processing and report writing.

 o  The Historian FM enables users to define the type of data to be col-
    lected, the managed objects or management applications from which
    the data is to be collected, and the collection interval.





                                  9

 

 o  The Export FM, when used with a separate, external relational database
    and report writing tools, can be used to create customized network
    usage reports. The historical data-recording and data-export func-
    tions can also be used in combination with other DECmcc FMs to gather
    statistics, status, and configuration data.


 DECmcc BMS Performance Statistics Functions

 DECmcc BMS Performance Statistics are provided by the Performance Anal-
 ysis FM. It enables users to access real-time or historical perfor-
 mance statistics and reports on DECnet, Digital LAN Bridge, and TCP
 /IP objects. Sample error, traffic, and statistics reports are also
 provided.

 The Performance Analyzer FM provides data normalization and statis-
 tical functions for DECnet nodes, TCP/IP hosts, and Digital LAN Bridges.

 Assuming that the appropriate Access Modules are installed, the Per-
 formance Analyzer FM supports the following objects/devices:

 o  DECnet Phase IV lines (DDCMP, Ethernet, X.25), circuits (DDCMP, Eth-
    ernet, X.25), and nodes (local and remote)

 o  DECnet/OSI end systems, datalinks (DDCMP, CSMACD, and HDLC), in-
    termediate systems (routing systems), routing ports, and routing
    circuits

 o  Bridge lines (LAN100, LAN150, LAN200, DECbridge 500, and DECbridge
    600)

 o  TCP/IP Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), Exterior Gate-
    way Protocol (EGP), Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), IN-
    TERFACE (the network interface such as Ethernet), Internet Proto-
    col (IP), Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User Datagram Pro-
    tocol (UDP), EGP Neighbor table, and SNMP child entity.




                                 10

 

 The Performance Analyzer FM supports the following classes of network
 statistics:

 o  Throughput - the amount of data that is sent between two points in
    a specified unit of time

 o  Averages - such as Average Outbound Block Size and Average Outbound
    Message Size

 o  Overhead - the amount of control overhead present for circuits and
    lines

 o  Percents - percent of total traffic or resource availability

 o  Rates - the counts over a specified period of time

 o  Utilization - ratio of real or rated throughput to the actual through-
    put expressed as a percentage, such as Outbound Utilization and Sin-
    gle Destination Utilization

 o  Counts - the normalized value of counters

 These statistics, like all other numeric attributes collected or gen-
 erated by DECmcc software, can be displayed as graphs or histograms
 in the Graphic Window that is part of the DECwindows/Iconic Map in-
 terface available with the DECmcc Director, BMS, and EMS products.

 Sample Reports are included with DECmcc BMS and are based on counters
 and statistics generated by the Performance Analyzer FM.

 Note: Data used for creating the sample reports must be exported to
 an external relational database using the Export FM. In addition, gen-
 erating and setting up the sample reports requires the following soft-
 ware products: CDD/PLUS, DATATRIEVE, and DECgraph.

 The sample reports include: traffic, error, traffic summary, error sum-
 mary, and bandwidth utilization for DECnet Phase IV, DECnet/OSI and
 TCP/IP SNMP.

 DECmcc BMS Presentation Modules

                                 11

 

 The DECmcc BMS includes two Presentation Modules: the DECwindows/Iconic
 Map PM, and the Forms and Command Line PM.

 The DECwindows/Iconic Map PM provides a graphic interface with pull-
 down command and monitor windows that consistently present all man-
 aged objects and operations. Consistent access is also provided by the
 Forms and Command Line PM.

 Iconic Map PM
 The Iconic Map PM with a DECwindows Interface uses the common features
 of any DECwindows application. Capabilities specific to this presen-
 tation style include:

 o  Map windows that display the contents of a managed environment (for
    example, a domain), using icons to represent managed objects and
    their subordinate or child objects. Users can select icons repre-
    senting managed objects and initiate management operations from a
    map window. Several map windows can be displayed at one time, each
    displaying different views of domains of a managed environment.

 o  A Navigation box and ViewPort window that enable users to view an
    entire network configuration map at one time. With the ViewPort fea-
    ture, users can navigate to, and select a particular portion of,
    the total network environment to display in detail in the map win-
    dow.

 o  Management windows that enable users to select, perform, and view
    the results of management operations. Like map windows, several dif-
    ferent management windows can be displayed simultaneously.

 o  Graph windows that enable users to select and display real-time or
    historical numeric attributes, such as counters, graphs, or his-
    tograms.

 o  A Toolbox window and other customization features that provide users
    with the ability to create, modify, or delete map icons, connect-
    ing lines, text, or other items in a map window. Users can create
    map icons, add geographic maps or other backdrops, and add customized
    icons to the Toolbox for retrieval and re-use.

                                 12

 

 Forms and Command Line PM
 The Forms and Command Line PM provides character cell access to DECmcc
 Director function and access capabilities. The interface supports two
 modes: Command Line mode and Forms mode.

 The Command Line mode enables users to create names or mnemonics and
 use special symbols to reduce data entry and eliminate input errors.
 It supports command line recall and editing, abbreviation, online Help,
 symbol substitution, use of control key sequences, line continuation,
 and the type-ahead function.

 Command Line mode also supports the use of scripts to automate fre-
 quently used DECmcc command sequences. Users can set up initializa-
 tion files through the Command Line mode for establishing defaults and
 executing startup directives. In addition, users can log any command
 to an output file for storage and review.

 The Forms mode provides the basic features of the Command Line mode
 in addition to a scroll feature that enables users to save up to 500
 lines of output from management directives, scroll through the saved
 output, and create new directives based on previous input. The Forms
 mode also allows printing and logging of entries made to the output
 region.

 Both the Forms mode and the Command Line mode, as well as the Iconic
 Map interface, provide online, context-sensitive help.

 DECmcc BMS Extensibility

 DECmcc BMS is an extensible management platform to which other DECmcc
 software modules, optional packages, third-party, or user-developed
 Management Modules can be added. For a list of Digital Management Mod-
 ules that can be added to the DECmcc BMS, refer to the Optional Soft-
 ware list below.






                                 13

 

 Third parties and users can develop software modules for DECmcc Fam-
 ily Products to provide access to, and management functions for, any
 manageable object. Software and documentation for the development of
 integrated DECmcc modules are available as part of the DECmcc Devel-
 oper's Toolkit. For more information about the DECmcc Developer's Toolkit,
 refer to SPD 32.49.xx.

 DECmcc BMS includes several utilities that enable on-site enrollment
 of Management Modules. Documentation required for third party-module
 enrollment must be supplied by the module developer.

 DECmcc Fault Diagnostic Package

 The DECmcc Fault Diagnostic Package is a troubleshooting tool designed
 to simplify the process of isolating and resolving some of the most
 frequently occurring TCP/IP network problems quickly, minimizing down-
 time and maximizing network efficiency. It uses common UNIX® Utili-
 ties and Bourne Shell scripts to retrieve information about a TCP/IP
 network.

 The DECmcc Diagnostic Option Package comprises ten diagnostic routines,
 a load check utility, a ping trace utility, and a ping utility. The
 diagnostic routines are:

 o  Diagnose host_unknown

 o  Diagnose host_unreachable

 o  Diagnose inetdaemon

 o  Diagnose network_unreachable

 o  Diagnose nfs_problem

 o  Diagnose rcp_denied

 o  Diagnose rlogin_denied

 o  Diagnose rsh_denied

 o  Diagnose telnet_timeout

                                 14

 

 o  Diagnose telnet_refused

 These routines are designed to assist users in isolating network faults
 such as component failures, improperly set parameters, and improper
 file protections. When a diagnostic routine is executed, the Fault Di-
 agnostic software determines the tests to execute. After the tests are
 executed, it produces a report containing test results and recommended
 actions an operator should take to repair or troubleshoot the prob-
 lem.

 The DECmcc Fault Diagnostic Package can diagnose problems between the
 station on which DECmcc resides and a remote host, or between two hosts
 that are remote from the DECmcc station with the DECmcc station re-
 siding on a third host which is not involved in the reported problem.

 DECmcc Extended LAN Manager (ELM) Packages

 DECmcc Extended LAN (Local Area Network) Manager Packages are Open-
 VMS layered products that enable DECmcc Director Family product users
 to configure, manage, monitor, and control LAN Bridge, DECbridge, and
 DECconcentrator 500 devices in the "Extended LAN" and FDDI network en-
 vironment. The term LAN Bridge is used to refer to Digital Equipment
 Corporation's LAN Bridge 100, LAN Bridge 150, LAN Bridge 200, METROWAVE
 Bridge, and the Chipcom® Ethermodem[TM] Broadband Bridge. The term DECbridge
 is used to refer to Digital Equipment Corporation's DECbridge 500 and
 600 Series products.

 The LAN Bridge and DECbridge products are the primary building blocks
 of the "Extended LAN" architecture. An Extended LAN is a collection
 of LANs that are interconnected and logically appear as one large Lo-
 cal Area Network. The DECconcentrator family of products is the pri-
 mary building block of the FDDI network environment. Together these
 environments are physically and logically attached and extended via
 the DECbridge family of products. The DECbridge product line is the
 family of products that allows Ethernet and FDDI networks to commu-
 nicate transparently.




                                 15

 

 The LAN Bridge and DECbridge products operate at the data link level,
 and FDDI DECconcentrators operate at the data link and physical link
 levels. Both product sets are transparent to upper-level protocols.

 This release of DECmcc Extended LAN Manager offers software which su-
 persedes the DECelms product functionality for the DECmcc environment.

 DECmcc Terminal Server Access Module

                                 17

 

 The DECmcc Terminal Server Access Module (AM) is a OpenVMS layered prod-
 uct that provides remote management access to Digital terminal servers
 within the DECmcc environment. The DECmcc Terminal Server AM allows
 DECmcc users to remotely configure and monitor Digital terminal servers
 anywhere in the extended Local Area Network (LAN) from a system run-
 ning DECmcc.

 DECmcc Terminal Server AM V1.0 is the release of software that pro-
 vides migration of the Terminal Server Manager (TSM) capabilities to
 the DECmcc environment.

 The general characteristics of DECmcc Terminal Server AM include:

 o  Remote management capabilities for Digital Terminal Servers

 o  Allows for observation, monitoring, and controlling of Digital Ter-
    minal Servers on Local Area Networks

 o  Ability to display and modify devices, links, physical ports, op-
    erational and permanent, LAT/Telnet database characteristics

 o  Customize site specific alarms for the devices stored in the MIR
    (Management Information Repository) for faults, errors, and changed
    information

 o  Simultaneous management access by multiple users

 o  On-line Help facility

 o  Similar display formats for all manageable terminal servers

 Management Information Repository (MIR)

 DECmcc Terminal Server AM (TSAM) provides a Management Information Repos-
 itory (MIR) that contains the name, Ethernet address, terminal server
 type, and other fields for each server to be managed. Through the TSAM
 MIR, the user needs to refer only to the name of the server in order
 to gain access.


                                 18

 

 DECnet Database Modification

 DECmcc Terminal Server AM can automatically update the DECnet manage-
 ment directory. Users do not need to separately use a DECnet AM to up-
 date DECnet information. The Terminal Server AM will access the DEC-
 net database itself to do the appropriate modifications.

 Fault Management

 Troubleshooting within the terminal server network is enhanced by TSAM
 providing the ability, centrally, to read traffic status and counters
 in addition to error status and counters. With the "PASTHRU" utility,
 the user can also connect directly to the server, allowing isolation
 of problems between DECmcc Terminal Server AM and the server.

 DECmcc Terminal Server AM V1.0 supports terminal servers running the
 following software:

 o  DECserver 100 for OpenVMS V1.2 - V2.0

 o  DECserver 200 for OpenVMS V1.0 - V3.1

 o  DECserver 250 for OpenVMS V1.0 - V2.0

 o  DECserver 300 for OpenVMS V1.0 - V2.1

 o  DECserver 500 for OpenVMS V1.2 - V2.1

 o  DECserver 700 for OpenVMS V1.0

 o  DECserver 90TL V1.0

 o  DECserver 90L V1.0

 o  MUXserver 100 Remote Terminal Server for OpenVMS V2.0 - V2.3

 o  MUXserver 300 Remote Terminal Server for OpenVMS V1.0 - V1.3

 LAN Traffic Monitor (LTM) OpenVMS

                                 19

 

 LAN Traffic Monitor (LTM) OpenVMS is the software portion of a fully
 distributed monitor that can support the capture and presentation of
 traffic data from an extended Ethernet. A LAN Bridge 100 or LAN Bridge
 150, downline loaded with monitoring software, is attached to the Eth-
 ernet cable and transmits information to an OpenVMS layered applica-
 tion software program located on any VAX in the extended LAN. Multi-
 ple users, from different nodes on the extended Ethernet, may access
 the traffic data. LAN Traffic Monitor also works with Chipcom's Broad-
 band Bridges called Ethermodem III Bridges.

 LAN Bridge hardware can run either as a LAN Traffic Monitor or as a
 LAN Bridge, i.e., the primary building block of the Extended LAN ar-
 chitecture. An Extended LAN is a collection of LANs that are inter-
 connected and logically appear as one large Local Area Network.

 Note that when a bridge is used as a monitoring device or listener,
 it does not function as a bridge. Users can remotely switch a bridge
 between monitoring and standard bridge modes using Digital's DECmcc
 ELM FM and AM software.

 With the LAN Bridge designed to work at full Ethernet speed, the LAN
 Traffic Monitor can provide real-time data on Ethernet LAN through-
 put and utilization, allowing a customer to actively monitor their Eth-
 ernet usage. The ability to collect data on any protocol type (i.e.,
 LAT, 802.3, DECnet, TCP/IP, etc.) on the Ethernet is also provided.

 LAN Traffic Monitor contains the LTM Listener software (which counts
 and classifies Ethernet traffic using a LAN Bridge as a monitoring de-
 vice) and the LTM User Interface (which collects and displays data re-
 ceived from the LTM Listener).

 The LTM Listener periodically reports traffic statistics to the LTM
 User Interface located on a VAX host. The LTM User Interface receives
 unsolicited Ethernet datagrams generated by the LTM Listener, and through
 the menu structure, the user can also ask the LTM Listener for addi-
 tional data not found in the unsolicited messages. A single LTM host
 can be used in conjunction with multiple LTM listeners.



                                 20

 

 The LTM User Interface performs the necessary data reduction and presents
 the statistics in logical groupings. Summary displays, which are pre-
 sented in tabular format, include Network Traffic, Top Ten Talkers,
 and Throughput and Utilization. LTM also displays Lists of Nodes, Mul-
 ticast Addresses, Protocols Used by Nodes, Node Traffic by Protocol
 Type, Multicast Traffic by Protocol Type, and Protocol Type Traffic.

 In addition, LAN utilization based on the most recent traffic data re-
 ceived from the LTM Listener may be displayed graphically in inter-
 vals of one, four, eight, twelve, twenty-four, or forty-eight hours.

 NMCC/VAX ETHERnim

 NMCC/VAX ETHERnim is a network management application that provides
 the network manager with a tool to gather information about Ethernet
 nodes, verify reachability of nodes, provide a graphical display of
 local area network topology and monitor Ethernet traffic.

 NMCC/VAX ETHERnim consists of two categories of software: one must be
 installed on an OpenVMS system set up as the Host, and the other can
 be optionally installed on Target systems running OpenVMS. In this con-
 text, the Host is defined as the node where the NMCC/VAX ETHERnim ap-
 plication runs, while the Target systems are those DECnet nodes on the
 Ethernet segments which are being tested at the User (task) level. The
 optional software installed on the Target system is referred to as the
 Remote Files.

 The Host software requires Phase IV DECnet software on a OpenVMS sys-
 tem. When this software has been installed, the network manager has
 the ability to:

 o  Build a permanent database containing basic information about each
    node directly connected to the Ethernet local area network through
    user commands and automatic procedures.

 o  Manually construct and maintain a topological view of the network,
    including transparent network devices (e.g., DEMPR, DELNI, DEREP).

 o  Test the Ethernet network to help isolate and identify problems.

                                 21

 

 o  Test the communications path to each node up to the DNA applica-
    tion layer by performing a loopback test to a specified user ac-
    count. This feature is available only for OpenVMS Target systems.

 o  Monitor the network to determine which nodes are the top talkers
    and which nodes are the top listeners; sort/display traffic by pro-
    tocol type or multicast address; focus on traffic to/from a spec-
    ified node.

 o  Perform information access to properly configured DECnet nodes on
    the Ethernet to determine the remote nodes's system type, hardware
    configuration, and software configuration.

 Note: Under high Ethernet utilization (above 20%), the ETHERnim Mon-
 itor function may cause performance problems on the host running ETH-
 ERnim. This may affect time-sensitive network applications which are
 connected to the host running ETHERnim.

 Terminal Server Manager (TSM)

 Terminal Server Manager (TSM) OpenVMS software allows suitably priv-
 ileged users on a VAX host to control and observe terminal servers any-
 where in the extended local area network. TSM provides centralization
 and increased flexibility in configuring, monitoring, and controlling
 Digital Equipment Corporation's family of terminal servers.

 TSM's enhancements provide management support for Digital's newest ad-
 dition of Terminal Servers - DECserver 700, DECserver 90L+, DECserver
 90TL, as well as upgraded support for DECserver 90L. It also includes
 an automated database conversion from TSM V1.5 to TSM V1.6. The new
 TRIGGER SERVER command enables a reboot to an unattended or remote ter-
 minal server.

 TSM Features

 Telnet Functionality




                                 22

 

 TSM supports a new set of server commands to provide management of the
 Telnet characteristics of a terminal server.

 Management Directory

 TSM provides a directory that contains the name, Ethernet address, ter-
 minal server type, and other fields for each server to be managed. Through
 the TSM directory, the user needs to refer only to the name of the server
 to gain access.


 Server Selection

 TSM provides a USE command to allow selection of the server or servers
 to be managed, or the directory to be referenced. TSM allows the user
 to manage, from one server, all of the servers in the directory at a
 time. The user can choose to manage a partition of servers, all servers
 of a specified type, or all servers matching a wildcarded server or
 partition specification.


 Volatile Characteristics

 TSM manages the volatile characteristics for all terminal server types.


 Permanent Characteristics

 TSM manages permanent NVRAM characteristics for the DECserver 100, DEC-
 server 200, DECserver 250, DECserver 300, DECserver 90L, DECserver 90L+,
 DECserver 90TL, DECserver 700, MUXserver 100, MUXserver 300, and MUXserver
 380. For the Ethernet Terminal Server and DECserver 500, TSM modifies
 the permanent attributes contained within the image files that are down-
 line loaded.






                                 23

 

 Terminal Server Trigger

 Capability via TSM that will cause the server to load with whatever
 server software is specified in NVRAM.

 Database Manipulation

 TSM can access and manipulate the database associated with each server
 within its jurisdiction, including their characteristics and param-
 eters.


 DECnet Database Modification

 TSM automatically updates the DECnet database for servers to match the
 DECnet related information in the management directory. It is not nec-
 essary for users to employ a separate DSVCONFIG or TSVNCP configura-
 tion program.


 3270 Option Software

 TSM provides support for the 3270 Option Software for the CXM04 line
 card. This line card provides the capability to connect the 3270 class
 of terminals to systems on Ethernet.


 Keyboard Mapping

 This functionality enables the terminal server manager to customize
 3270 keyboard tables supplied with the 3270 Option Software by chang-
 ing the way individual 3270 keyboard keys are mapped to Digital's VT220
 keys.


 DCL Commands




                                 24

 

 TSM commands may be issued as DCL commands; the syntax follows DCL con-
 ventions.

 Command Files

 Command files may be maintained outside TSM (e.g., by use of a VAX/OpenVMS
 editor). This command file support allows values of characteristics
 to be stored on the host, effectively creating a copy of the perma-
 nent database that may be used to configure new servers. Server main-
 tenance is also enhanced by allowing the terminal server to be eas-
 ily box swapped and parameters reset. Up to eight parameters may be
 passed to TSM command files. Additionally, command files may operate
 on a single server, on a logical group (a partition) of servers, or
 on all servers.


 Fault Management

 Troubleshooting within the terminal server network is enhanced by TSM
 providing the ability, centrally, to read traffic status and counters
 in addition to error status and counters. With the "PASTHRU" command,
 the user can also connect directly to the server without using TSM,
 allowing isolation of problems between TSM and the server.

 A simple connectivity test to a specific server or all servers listed
 in the directory is provided with an informational message displayed
 for each server not responding. TSM allows the user to check period-
 ically for non-functioning terminal servers. This function might be
 performed from within a batch job, to run without user involvement,
 but informing the appropriate personnel if a server connectivity prob-
 lem is detected.

 Via the TEST DELAY command, users can measure timing delays associ-
 ated with data transmission to and from servers.

 The TEST CONNECTION command tests the ability to submit a print job
 to a server port.
