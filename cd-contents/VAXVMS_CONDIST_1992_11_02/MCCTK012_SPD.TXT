 PRODUCT NAME:  DECmcc Developer's Toolkit, Version 1.2 SPD 32.49.02

 INTRODUCTION

 The DECmcc Developer's Toolkit consists of software and documentation
 used in the development of DECmcc Access Modules (AMs) and Function
 Modules (FMs). Available in OpenVMS VAX and RISC/ULTRIX versions, the
 product is intended for experienced system software developers.

 The DECmcc Developer's Toolkit is one of several products in the DECmcc
 Product Family, a group of related network and system management soft-
 ware products based on the Digital Enterprise Management Architecture
 (EMA). For an overview of these products, refer to the DECmcc Manage-
 ment Services Software Product Description (SPD 37.20.xx).

 DESCRIPTION

 The DECmcc Developer's Toolkit consists of software tools and docu-
 mentation that enable users to design and develop Access or Function
 Modules for the following DECmcc Family products:

 o  DECmcc Director (SPD 32.46.xx)

 o  DECmcc Basic Management System (DECmcc BMS, SPD 32.48.xx)

 o  DECmcc Enterprise Management Station (DECmcc EMS, SPD 31.88.xx)

 Note: DECmcc Director or DECmcc BMS software is required for installing,
 enrolling, testing, and operating management modules developed using
 the DECmcc Toolkit. The DECmcc Developer's Toolkit software simpli-
 fies the design and implementation of application-specific modules by
 offering a runtime kernel executive, various service programs, and source
 code for sample Access and Function Modules.

 Documentation

 The DECmcc Developer's Toolkit documentation provides information to
 assist in the design and development of DECmcc Management Modules. It
 includes the following documents:

 o  Enterprise Management Architecture General Description

 o  EMA Entity Model

 o  The DECmcc System Reference Manual

 o  DECmcc Management Module Programming

 o  DECmcc Developer's Toolkit Reference

 The DECmcc Module reference manuals, available on-line only, provide
 specifications of the services offered and required by each DECmcc man-
 agement module.

 Development Utilities/Tools

 Development utilities and tools that are part of the Toolkit include
 the Design Framework, a sample Access Module, and an example Function
 Module:

 o  DECmcc Design Framework is a set of generic software components that
    enables users to construct a starter Management Module. Such a mod-
    ule can be used as a base for the development of application-specific
    Access or Function Modules. The Design Framework uses proven de-
    velopment techniques that minimize coding errors, expedite devel-
    opment, and reduce coding ambiguities that can arise during mod-
    ule design.

 o  Sample Access Module is a basic example of an AM that can be run
    on a DECmcc Management System. It contains working examples of many
    of the DECmcc interfaces, including the mcc_call interface, and calls
    to many of the DECmcc routines that enable Management Modules to
    reside on and interoperate within a DECmcc system. The Sample AM
    is implemented using the Design Framework.

                                  2

 

    Note: The Sample AM explicitly uses Phase IV of DECnet-VAX or DECnet-ULTRIX.
    If DECnet is unavailable, the Sample AM may be run with the trans-
    port disabled for illustration purposes only.

 o  Example Function Module contains working examples of common rou-
    tines used by FMs to access the services of the DECmcc system and
    other FMs and AMs. It is layered on top of the Sample AM.

 The following utilities are included in the DECmcc Director and Ba-
 sic Management System Software and are necessary for enrolling application-
 specific access modules and related files into the DECmcc system:

 o  Management Specification Language (MSL) Translator Utility

 o  Dictionary Administrator Program (DAP) Utility

 o  Test Bed Driver (TBD) Utility

 o  Help File Builder (HFB) Utility

 These utilities allow on-site enrollment of access and function mod-
 ules. The DECmcc Developer's Toolkit Reference (AA-PD5MA-TE) describes
 each utility in detail.
