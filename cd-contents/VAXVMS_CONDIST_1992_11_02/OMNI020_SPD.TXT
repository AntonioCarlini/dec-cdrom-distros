 PRODUCT NAME:  DEComni for VMS, Version 2.0            SPD 32.32.02
                (Digital's Open Manufacturing Network In-
                terconnect)

 DESCRIPTION

 DEComni is a network communication product that provides an Applica-
 tion Programming Interface (API) for connection and management of man-
 ufacturing shop floor devices. DEComni implements the Manufacturing
 Message Specification (MMS), ISO/IEC 9506-1 and ISO/IEC 9506-2. When
 combined with prerequisite hardware and software, DEComni interoper-
 ates with other systems supporting the Manufacturing Message Speci-
 fication ISO/IEC9506-1 and ISO/IEC 9506-2 specifications.

 The DEComni API is also used by DECosap for VMS and provides for both
 open (OSI/MMS) and proprietary device connections. For more informa-
 tion about DECosap, please see that product's Software Product Descrip-
 tion (SPD 32.75.xx).

 The conformance of DEComni software to OSI standards is specified in
 Appendix A of this product's System Support Addendum (SSA 32.32.02-
 x).

 Features

 DEComni is an implementation of the Manufacturing Message Specifica-
 tion (MMS), ISO/IEC 9506, consisting of a callable interface on VMS
 that takes the proper arguments and transforms them into the proper
 MMS protocol.

 DEComni provides, as a minimal set, the Client Conformance require-
 ments for the services specified in MAP Implementation Class MAP3.

 The product may interoperate with those device vendors that have im-
 plemented to ISO/IEC 9506 (MMS).

                               DIGITAL                   August 1992

 DEComni provides a high level applications programming interface (API)
 with a high degree of functionality built in. The interface is easy
 to use and requires very little support code.

 Components

 Omni API

 Omni API contains a callable run-time library that is an implementa-
 tion of MMS. The actual support for services is listed in the Proto-
 col Implementation Conformance Statement (PICS) found in Appendix A:
 Conformance to Standards. Service classes supported are in the fol-
 lowing categories: Environment, VMD Support, Domains, Program Invo-
 cations, and Variables.

 Object Definition Facility (ODF)

 ODF is used to define the objects and attribute values that are ex-
 pected to be found at a remote Virtual Manufacturing Device (VMD). This
 facility is also used to define aspects of a local VMD if supported
 by the application.

 ODF is used to define the mapping of MMS variable types to and from
 VMS data type definitions.

 OmniView

 OmniView is a demonstration application written using the callable in-
 terface that operates in a DECwindows Motif(R) environment. It provides
 a limited user interface to the following MMS client services from a
 VAXstation running the prerequisite software:

 o  Initiate

 o  Conclude

 o  Status

 o  Abort

 o  GetNameList

 o  Identify

                                  2

 

 o  GetCapabilityList

 o  Read

 o  Write

 o  Start

 o  Stop

 o  Reset

 o  GetVariableAccessAttributes

 o  GetDomainAttributes

 o  GetProgramInvocationAttributes

 DEComni Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)

 The DEComni IVP performs a series of tests to verify proper instal-
 lation.

 INSTALLATION

 Only experienced customers should install DEComni for VMS software.
 Digital recommends that all other customers purchase Digital's Instal-
 lation Services. These services provide for installation of the soft-
 ware product by an experienced Digital Software Specialist.

 Installation for DEComni consists of the following:

 o  Verification that all components of DEComni have been received

 o  Verification that the necessary versions of the prerequisite soft-
    ware and documentation are available

 o  Verification of the appropriate system parameters

 o  Verification that the system meets the minimum hardware and soft-
    ware requirements as specified in the System Support Addendum (SSA
    32.32.02-x)

                                  3

 

 o  Customer making available for a reasonable period of time, as mu-
    tually agreed upon by Digital and the customer, all hardware com-
    munication facilities and terminals that are to be used during in-
    stallation

 o  Installation of the DEComni software by creating the necessary di-
    rectories and by copying the software from the distribution media

 o  Verification that DEComni has been installed correctly by using the
    IVP

 Note: Should a customer attempt the installation and require the ser-
 vices of a software specialist to modify the previously installed op-
 erating system parameters, or aid in the installation, a time and ma-
 terials charge will apply.

 Connectivity to all other nodes within the network is the responsi-
 bility of the customer.
