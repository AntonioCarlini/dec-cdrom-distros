 PRODUCT NAME:  DECdesign for OpenVMS VAX, Version 2.0  SPD 29.29.04

 DESCRIPTION

 DECdesign is a CASE product that supports the development of software
 applications. Through the use of graphical modeling techniques, the
 user can perform analysis and design for the application under devel-
 opment. DECdesign offers the choice of structured or object oriented
 modeling techniques. The user is given the ability, in selected tech-
 niques, to generate SQL (for the creation of a database) or C++ code
 for the applications.

 DECdesign supports many popular modeling techniques. The structured
 techniques support the ability to create integrated process and data
 models (conceptual and logical) and generate VAX Rdb SQL for the user's
 application. The structured techniques supported in DECdesign include:

 o  Yourdon with Ward-Mellor extensions/Extended Entity Relationship
    (EER)/Logical Data Modeling (LDM)/VAX Rdb SQL Generation

    Note: DECdesign does not validate Ward-Mellor State Transition Di-
    agrams or State Tables.

 o  Gane and Sarson/EER/LDM/VAX Rdb SQL Generation

 o  Merise/LDM/VAX Rdb SQL Generation

 The object-oriented techniques newly supported in DECdesign include:

 o  Ptech® TM OO Analysis and Design with the Ptech C++ Code Genera-
    tor

 o  Coad/Yourdon OO Analysis and Design (which supports the generation
    of C++ header files)

 Features

 DECdesign is a multiple-user system that supports concurrent access,
 data security, and permanent data storage.

 DECdesign stores analysis and design models in a design library. A li-
 brary has the following functions:

 o  Security - users can be authorized to use a library.

 o  Data storage - the library maintains incremental versions of views.

 o  Data sharing - all authorized users of a library have access to all
    views in the library.

 o  Design control - the library applies the rules for the specified
    modeling technique and includes:

    -  The shape and meaning of graphical objects in a model

    -  The relationships between the objects in a model

    -  Requirements for a valid model

    -  Tools for evaluating and reporting on the state of the models

 DECdesign is integrated (for Yourdon, Gane and Sarson, and Merise) with
 CDD/Repository (referred to as CDD in all following text). Selected
 data definitions stored in CDD can be re-used by importing and link-
 ing to models produced in DECdesign. Likewise, selected data defini-
 tions created in DECdesign can be exported and linked to CDD. Noti-
 fication of changes to these linked definitions in CDD is provided to
 the DECdesign user during validation of the model.

 DECdesign allows the user to interactively navigate through the de-
 sign library determining where elements of that design are used. In-
 formation about the design library is also provided to the user with
 the aid of an extensive set of report templates. These reports can be
 previewed on the display or output to an OpenVMS file using the Dig-
 ital Data Interchange Format (DDIF), which is a part of Digital Equip-
 ment Corporation's Compound Document Architecture (CDA).

                                  2

 

 DECdesign has been implemented to support a client/server model of op-
 eration. The product can run on a stand-alone workstation with both
 client and server images of DECdesign running on the workstation. Al-
 ternatively, the client and server images of DECdesign can be divided
 physically to run on separate systems. Client and server image instal-
 lation can be selected at installation time. For further information
 and installation procedures, refer to the DECdesign Installation Guide.
