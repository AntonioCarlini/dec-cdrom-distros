 PRODUCT NAME:  DECnet/SNA[R] Data Transfer Facility, Version 3.1  SPD 27.85.04

 DESCRIPTION

 The DECnet/SNA Data Transfer Facility (DTF) is a layered software prod-
 uct that provides data transfer capabilities between IBM[R] MVS and IBM
 VM systems in a Systems Network Architecture (SNA) environment and Dig-
 ital DECnet nodes in a DECnet network. DTF supports the following DEC-
 net nodes: VMS systems running DECnet-VAX, RSX-11M-PLUS systems run-
 ning DECnet-11M-PLUS, ULTRIX systems running DECnet-ULTRIX, MS-DOS[R]
 systems running PATHWORKS for DOS, and OS/2[R] systems running PATHWORKS
 for OS/2. Access between the cooperating Digital and IBM environments
 is provided by a DECnet/SNA Gateway or by VMS/SNA software.

 The following briefly highlights the features of DTF. More detailed
 information is given in the Features section. Unless otherwise men-
 tioned, these features are supported on both MVS and VM systems.

 Client/Server-Style Operation

 The DTF product provides a client/server style of operation. The VMS
 /DTF server can support file operations between IBM MVS and VM clients
 and DECnet VMS, ULTRIX, RSX-11M-PLUS, MS-DOS, and OS/2 clients. No ad-
 ditional software besides DECnet software is required on the DECnet
 clients (except for VMS recoverable copy operations). Refer to the Con-
 figuration section for more information.

 Ease of Use

 DTF provides a familiar user interface for both Digital (VMS, MS-DOS,
 OS/2, ULTRIX, and RSX-11M-PLUS DECnet nodes) and IBM users. This fea-
 ture supports easy application development and reduces staff train-
 ing.

 Comprehensive, Bidirectional Access from All Supported Clients

 The DTF product enables bidirectional file transfer between all DTF-
 supported DECnet nodes and IBM MVS and VM systems.

 Checkpoint and Recovery

 DTF provides VMS and IBM users with checkpoint and recovery support
 in the event of a system or network failure. This feature allows DTF
 to resume an interrupted recoverable copy operation when the network
 returns to a normal state. This saves significant time and system re-
 sources when large files are transferred.

 File Backup

 DTF allows VMS and ULTRIX users to target IBM disks and tapes for backup
 and restore operations. In large co-resident Digital and IBM sites,
 this capability optimizes system resource usage. Users have the abil-
 ity to include an allocation space qualifier when backing up files to
 target IBM disks to insure proper disk space availability.

 Remote Job Submission

 DTF users can submit jobs remotely from all DECnet clients (VMS, RSX-11M-PLUS,
 MS-DOS, OS/2, and ULTRIX).

 Post-Processing

 Using DTF, VMS, and IBM, users can provide a post-processing file to
 be executed after a file transfer is completed. This feature allows
 VMS and IBM users to logically connect the running of a batch job to
 the successful completion of a DTF file transfer. This makes the im-
 plementation of distributed processing functions significantly eas-
 ier to synchronize between IBM applications and VAX DECnet-based ap-
 plications.

 Record-Level Access

 DTF supports record-level access from VMS systems to IBM MVS and VM
 systems.

 Supported File Types

                                  2

 

 DTF supports multiple file types (RMS, VSAM, BSAM, and CMS), allow-
 ing easy applications development. DTF also supports mixed case IBM
 file specifications.

 FTAM/OSI Support

 Users in an Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) network can transfer
 files to and from an IBM system by using VAX FTAM in conjunction with
 DTF software. IBM users can also transfer files to and from systems
 in an OSI network by using DTF software and the DAP-FTAM Gateway.

 HSM Support

 DTF supports IBM's Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM) facility. This
 is a DTF for MVS only feature.

 IBM Enterprise Architecture and SMS Support

 DTF runs in compliance with IBM's Enterprise Architecture and will sup-
 port SMS-managed data sets (refer to the Supported IBM Configurations
 section). This is a DTF for MVS only feature.

 Data Translation Using Load Balancing and Performance Tuning

 DTF supports text translation from DMCS (Digital Multinational Char-
 acter Set, a superset of ASCII) to EBCDIC and vice versa on a record-
 by-record basis. DTF supports load balancing and performance tuning
 between the IBM system and the VMS/DTF server node by allowing users
 to select which system performs the text translation. Enhanced per-
 formance of the VMS/DTF server often results when this translation is
 performed on the IBM system. DTF also supports, through the VAX Common
 Data Dictionary (CDD) product, field-level translation.

 Data Security

 Security is enhanced by the use of Proxies. IBM users are not required
 to specify a DECnet password; DTF will initiate the access on the VMS
 systems with a user ID derived from the IBM User ID.

 DTF controls access and protects valuable data with superior security
 capabilities. DTF supports the following industry-standard security
 interfaces that run on IBM machines: RACF, CA-ACF2[TM], SAF, and VMSECURE[TM].

 Server Management

                                  4

 

 The DTF product includes a management utility to manage the VMS/DTF
 server.

 Event Logging

 DTF for IBM logs events which can be used for historical inquiry or
 accounting. System programmers can easily write specialized account-
 ing and bill-back reports using DTF's logs.

 Components

 There are four components to the DECnet/SNA Data Transfer Facility prod-
 uct:

 o  Data Transfer Facility server (VMS/DTF server) software

 o  Data Transfer Facility utilities (VMS/DTF utilities) software

 o  Data Transfer Facility for IBM MVS system (DTF for MVS) software

 o  Data Transfer Facility for IBM VM system (DTF for VM) software

 VMS/DTF Server Software

 The VMS/DTF server software can be installed on any VMS system in a
 DECnet network containing a DECnet/SNA Gateway or on any VMS system
 running VMS/SNA. The node that is running the VMS/DTF server software
 is referred to as the server node. All DTF file requests go through
 this server node which communicates with the appropriate DTF for IBM
 system by using a DECnet/SNA Gateway or by using VMS/SNA software. The
 server software also performs text translation (DMCS/EBCDIC). However,
 this can be done optionally by the DTF for IBM software. The VAX Common
 Data Dictionary product is required on the VMS/DTF server node for the
 translation of data types other than DMCS/EBCDIC. The VMS/DTF server
 software includes the VMS/DTF utilities software described in the next
 section.

 VMS/DTF Utilities Software


                                  5

 

 The VMS/DTF utilities software is an optional component that can be
 installed on any VMS system where users wish to transfer files using
 the recoverable copy feature. The utilities software should also be
 installed if IBM users will be requesting recoverable copies involv-
 ing that VMS node. The utilities software consists of a server man-
 agement utility and a checkpoint/recovery utility (TRANSFER/DTF). The
 VMS/DTF utilities software communicates with the VMS/DTF server soft-
 ware to accomplish the data transfer. It is not necessary to install
 the VMS/DTF utilities software on the server node since these util-
 ities are included in the VMS/DTF server software package.

 DTF for MVS Software

 The DTF for MVS software can be installed on any IBM S/370-class ma-
 chine system running the MVS Operating System. DTF for MVS accepts file
 operation commands from the VMS/DTF server software and maps them into
 MVS file commands to perform the operation. It also provides inter-
 faces so TSO users can issue recoverable and non-recoverable copy com-
 mands in interactive or batch mode. DTF for MVS software consists of
 two parts: a VTAM application program that controls the communications
 with the VMS/DTF server nodes for the purpose of transferring files,
 and user interfaces. The three user interfaces are: a TSO command pro-
 cessor, a single-line command interface (REXX required), and an ISPF
 dialog.

 DTF for VM Software

 The DTF for IBM VM software can be installed on any IBM S /370-class
 machine system running the VM Operating System. DTF for VM accepts file
 operation commands from the VMS/DTF server software and maps them into
 VM file commands to perform the operation. It also provides interfaces
 so CMS users can issue recoverable and non-recoverable copy commands
 in interactive or batch mode. DTF for VM software consists of three
 parts: a VTAM application program that controls the communications with
 the VMS/DTF server, a CMS application for the purpose of transferring
 files, and user interfaces. The three user interfaces are: a DTF com-
 mand processor, a single-line command interface (REXX required), and
 an ISPF dialog.


                                  6

 

 Configuration

 A DTF for IBM component must be installed on each IBM system with which
 users want to communicate. The DECnet network requires one VMS/DTF server
 component installed on a VMS system, and may require multiple server
 component installations depending on the amount of use of DTF. All other
 nodes in the DECnet network, including VMS, ULTRIX, MS-DOS, OS/2, and
 RSX, do not require any additional software since DTF allows users to
 use standard DECnet file transfer commands to access IBM files. The
 VMS/DTF utilities software is required only if a particular VMS sys-
 tem's users need the recoverable copy feature or if IBM users desire
 recoverable copy operations to that VMS system. Recoverable copy works
 only to VMS nodes with the VMS/DTF server software or the VMS/DTF util-
 ities software installed.

 Features

 Ease of Use

 The DTF product uses a variety of familiar user interfaces to make users
 more productive. Users do not have to learn new commands and proce-
 dures.

 Users in the VMS environment can issue standard DCL commands, like COPY,
 TYPE, DIRECTORY, and so on. Alternatively, they can use the Record Man-
 agement System (RMS) programming interface or the TRANSFER/DTF util-
 ity for data exchange between DECnet and IBM systems.

 IBM MVS users can access and transfer data by using the TSO DTF com-
 mand processor, the TSO ISPF panels, or the single-line interface. IBM
 VM users can use the CMS DTF command processor, the CMS ISPF panels
 or the single-line interface. The TSO and CMS command processors can
 also be invoked in batch mode.

 ULTRIX users access files by using the standard DECnet-ULTRIX file trans-
 fer commands. MS-DOS and OS/2 users simply issue the standard PATH-
 WORKS for DOS or PATHWORKS for OS/2 NFT commands. RSX-11M-PLUS users
 can use DCL commands or DECnet-11M-PLUS NFT and FTS commands.

 DTF Access from VMS Clients

 VMS DTF users can initiate non-recoverable or recoverable, bidirec-
 tional file transfers between IBM DTF clients and themselves. DTF sup-
 ports the following VMS DCL commands.

 Note: Some of the qualifiers associated with these DCL commands are sub-
 ject to restrictions when used with DTF.
 
 APPEND      DELETE       SEARCH

 BACKUP      DIFFERENCES  REMOTE
             SUBMIT

 CLOSE       DIRECTORY    TYPE

 CONVERT     EXCHANGE     WRITE
             /NETWORK

 COPY        OPEN

 CREATE      READ

 DTF Access from RSX-11M-PLUS Clients

 RSX-11M-PLUS DTF users can initiate non-recoverable, bidirectional file
 transfers between IBM clients and themselves. RSX-11M-PLUS users can
 use all three network file transfer interfaces provided by DECnet-11M-PLUS
 (NFT, DCL, FTS). DTF supports the following DECnet-11M-PLUS DCL com-
 mands.

 Note: Some of these commands are subject to restrictions when used with
 DTF.
 
 APPEND      DELETE       SUBMIT/REMOTE

 COPY        DIRECTORY    TYPE

 DTF Access from MS-DOS and OS/2 Clients

                                  8

 

 MS-DOS and OS/2 DTF users can initiate non-recoverable, bidirectional
 file transfers between IBM DTF clients and themselves. IBM-initiated
 file transfers are supported by MS-DOS and OS/2 systems when the PATH-
 WORKS for DOS or PATHWORKS for OS/2 File Access Listener (FAL) is run-
 ning. DTF supports the following PATHWORKS for DOS and PATHWORKS for
 OS/2 NFT commands.

 Note: Some of these commands are subject to restrictions when used with
 DTF.

 
 APPEND      DELETE       SUBMIT

 COPY        DIRECTORY    TYPE

 DTF Access from ULTRIX Clients

 ULTRIX DTF users can initiate non-recoverable, bidirectional file trans-
 fers between DTF for IBM systems and themselves. DTF supports the fol-
 lowing DECnet-ULTRIX commands.

 Note: Some of these commands are subject to restrictions when used with
 DTF.

 DTF Access from IBM Clients

 IBM DTF users can initiate non-recoverable or recoverable, bidirec-
 tional file transfers between VMS DTF clients running the VMS/DTF util-
 ities software and themselves. In addition, they can initiate non-recoverable,
 bidirectional file transfer between all other DTF clients (including
 other IBM systems) and themselves. MVS TSO users and VM CMS users have
 the following commands available to transfer files to or from other
 DTF clients.

 Checkpoint and Recovery

 Checkpoint and recovery capabilities assure that data remains accu-
 rate and intact, even in the event of system or network failure. When
 VMS users transfer files using the TRANSFER/DTF utility, it automat-
 ically resumes an interrupted file transfer process with no loss of
 data when communications between sending and receiving systems are re-
 established. Checkpoint and recovery is supported for non-VSAM and CMS
 files that are disk- or tape-resident. Checkpoint and recovery is not
 supported on VSAM files.

 IBM users have a similar checkpoint and recovery feature. A recover-
 able copy operation performed from an IBM system sets environment vari-
 ables (CLIST in MVS, REXX in VM). If the transfer terminates with a
 network error, these variables contain information to allow the user
 to resume the transfer.

 File Backup

 DTF allows VMS users to back up and restore their disks directly to
 IBM tapes or disks using the VMS BACKUP command. ULTRIX users can also
 back up and restore disks to IBM tapes or disks. Users have the abil-
 ity to include an allocation space qualifier when backing up files to
 target IBM disks to insure proper disk space availability.

 Remote Job Submission

 VMS, ULTRIX, DOS, OS/2, and RSX-11M-PLUS users can submit JCL or REXX
 files on the IBM system to be executed by JES or by a batch machine.
 These users can use the standard DECnet file operation commands to ini-
 tiate the job submission. For example, VMS users use SUBMIT/REMOTE and
 ULTRIX users use dcp -S. Users will not get the status of the job com-
 pletion. IBM DTF users can submit jobs by using the post-processing
 feature described in the next section.

                                 10

 

 Post-Processing

 Post-processing is the ability to submit a DCL command procedure or
 MVS JCL or VM REXX procedure after a file transfer is completed. IBM
 users can use the post-processing feature from either the command pro-
 cessor or the panel interface. VMS users can use the post-processing
 feature only through the TRANSFER/DTF utility.

 Record-Level Access

 DTF allows a VMS user record-level access to IBM files by means of an
 RMS application, DCL commands, or DATATRIEVE. DTF does not support record-
 level access initiated from IBM to VMS RMS files.

 Supported File Types

 All VMS file types, RSX-11M-PLUS sequential files, and ULTRIX, MS-DOS,
 and OS/2 stream files are supported. MS-DOS and OS/2 support only stream
 files. Therefore, all files copied to MS-DOS or OS/2 systems result
 in stream files. All files copied from MS-DOS and OS/2 systems result
 in sequential data sets on IBM systems.

 For IBM MVS systems, supported non-VSAM file types are those with the
 physical sequential data set organization. This includes normal se-
 quential files as well as partitioned data set members. Both disk-resident
 and tape-resident non-VSAM files are supported. Supported VSAM file
 types include entry-sequenced data sets (ESDS), relative-record data
 sets (RRDS), and key-sequenced data sets (KSDS).

 For IBM VM systems, supported CMS file types are those with the phys-
 ical sequential data set organization. This includes normal sequen-
 tial files as well as MACLIB members. Both disk-resident and tape-resident
 files are supported and can be transferred. Supported DOS/VSE VSAM file
 types include entry-sequenced data sets (ESDS), relative-record data
 sets (RRDS), and key-sequenced data sets (KSDS). VM does not support
 creating empty files or creating null records in a file.




                                 11

 

 DTF provides an option for users to overcome the null record restric-
 tion by substituting a record containing a character or value chosen
 by the user. A mixed case option supports applications on the IBM side
 that create file specifications that are case sensitive. The case qual-
 ifier supports file specifications that contain lower case characters.

 FTAM/OSI Support

 Users in an OSI network can transfer files defined by FTAM/OSI stan-
 dard file types to IBM MVS or VM systems using VAX FTAM and DTF soft-
 ware. IBM TSO or CMS users can also transfer files to and from sys-
 tems in an OSI network using DTF and DAP-FTAM Gateway software. For
 more information on VAX FTAM and DAP-FTAM Gateway software refer to:
 VAX FTAM Software Product Description (SPD 29.86.xx).

 VAX VMS users will access the VAX FTAM user facilities to perform FTAM
 tasks. Users on other operating systems will use an initiator on their
 systems to access FTAM on VMS through the VAX FTAM responder. VAX FTAM
 responder then in turn accesses DTF to perform the tasks on the IBM
 system.

 VMS FTAM users can initiate non-recoverable, bidirectional file trans-
 fer between IBM clients and either themselves or remote OSI FTAM re-
 sponders.

 DTF supports the following VMS FTAM DCL commands.

 Note: Some of the qualifiers associated with these DCL commands are sub-
 ject to restrictions when used with DTF.
 
 APPEND      COPY         DELETE       DIRECTORY

 DTF supports the following FTAM document type files.

 o  FTAM-2 String Significant of None

 o  FTAM-1 String Significant of Fixed

 The following FTAM document type files are supported with these re-
 strictions:

                                 12

 

 o  FTAM-1 String Significance of Variable. Files can be copied to the
    IBM system but will loose the FTAM-1 file type definition. The file
    is translated as an FTAM-2 NOT significant file when the file is
    pulled back. File contents are not altered.

 o  FTAM-3 String Significance of Fixed. Files can be copied to the IBM
    system but will loose the attributes when the file is pulled back.
    The FTAM-3 file type changes to an FTAM-1 String Significance of
    FIXED when the file is pulled back. File contents are not altered.

 DTF does not support any other FTAM document type files or NBS-9 di-
 rectories.

 HSM Support

 DTF for MVS supports the Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM) facil-
 ity and allows users to recall migrated data sets. IBM system program-
 mers can tailor the number of concurrent outstanding HSM requests as
 well as device recall capability.

 SMS Support

 DTF for MVS supports the MVS Storage Management Subsystem (SMS) fa-
 cility.

 Data Translation

 DTF provides three options for data translation: no data translation
 at all, DMCS (Digital Multinational Character Set, a superset of ASCII)
 to EBCDIC and vice versa, and field-level translation.

 o  Users can specify that DTF should perform no data translation dur-
    ing a file transfer. This option is useful for transferring image
    files.

 o  By default, DTF performs data translation from DMCS to EBCDIC and
    vice versa on a record-by-record basis. This is the option normally
    used to transfer text files.


                                 13

 

 o  Users can specify that DTF use alternate field-level translation.
    In this case, the VMS/DTF server software translates data types such
    as binary, integer, floating point, packed decimal, and numeric strings
    using VAX Common Data Dictionary (CDD/Plus) record definitions sup-
    plied by the user. The semantics of data in the file is maintained
    across a file transfer. The CDD/Plus product is required on the VMS
    /DTF server node for alternate field-level data translation.

 By default, data translation is performed on the VMS/DTF server node.
 To decrease the load on the VMS/DTF server, the server manager can op-
 tionally specify that data translation (DMCS /EBCDIC) occur on the IBM
 DTF client.

 Data Security

 Files on the IBM system are accessible only to Digital users who know
 the valid access control information. DTF for IBM provides interfaces
 into the CA-ACF2, RACF, and VMSECURE security systems and a standard
 user exit for other security mechanisms (such as CA-TOPSECRET[TM]) through
 the System Authorization Facility (SAF) interface. For Digital sys-
 tems, security is maintained by using the standard file protection mech-
 anism provided by the base operating system.

 DTF also allows DECnet-style proxy information to be stored on the IBM
 system using standard IBM system security packages (CA-ACF2, RACF).
 DTF for VM supports Proxy access in the VMSECURE environment as well.

 For ease of use, DTF for IBM allows users to perform file transfers
 without having to provide passwords for their files located on their
 own IBM system.

 Server Management

 VMS/DTF provides a management utility to manage the server account database,
 the file definition database, and the DTF proxy databases on the VMS
 /DTF server. The server account database allows the server to support
 file transfer requests to many different IBM DTF clients. The file def-
 inition database allows users to store the IBM file specifications for
 frequently accessed files. The proxy database allows the server man-
 ager to set up mappings that allow users to enter requests without spec-
 ifying their IBM passwords. Refer to the Data Security section for more
 information.

 Event Logging

 DTF for IBM logs events which can be used for historical inquiry or
 for accounting usage. Historical logging can be used to characterize
 the use of DTF for IBM. Such information is necessary for decisions
 involving operating hours, performance tuning, and load analysis of
 the network and operating system. Account logging allows users of DTF
 for IBM functions to be recorded along with the resources they con-
 sume. The granularity of the information is sufficient to provide a

                                 15

 

 bill-back capability. Implementation of the accounting and billing ca-
 pability is handled with a user exit and can be customized on a per-
 site basis.
