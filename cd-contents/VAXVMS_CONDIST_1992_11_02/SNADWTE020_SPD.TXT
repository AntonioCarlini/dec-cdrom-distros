 PRODUCT NAME:  DECwindows DECnet/SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator     SPD
 31.58.01                for VMS, Version 2.0

 DESCRIPTION

 The DECwindows DECnet/SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator (DECwindows TE) for
 VMS is a software product that allows users of supported, VMS-based
 Digital Workstations and Servers (VAX) and X Terminals in a DECnet net-
 work to access and use applications running on an IBM[R] mainframe.

 The DECwindows Terminal Emulator also provides access to IBM appli-
 cations for PCs and Apple[R] Macintosh[R] users running on Digital's PATH-
 WORKS network operating system.

 The product runs in the DECwindows Motif[R] environment, and communi-
 cates with IBM host systems through a DECnet/SNA Transport (for VMS
 and ULTRIX) or VMS/SNA (for VMS only). Use of the DECwindows TE is sup-
 ported on the following systems and environments:

 o  Digital Workstations/Servers (VAX)

 o  Digital X-Terminal Product Set (VXT1XXX and VXT2XXX)

 o  PCs and Macintosh(s) within a Digital PATHWORKS network environ-
    ment

 Communicating Between IBM and Digital Systems

 In normal operation, IBM systems transfer a formatted screen much like
 a "form" or "panel" to the IBM 3270 block mode terminal. Terminal users
 fill in required data and the 3270 terminal transmits the completed
 form to the IBM host as a single unit. In contrast to this "block-mode"
 approach, Digital terminals and workstations send data to VMS or UL-
 TRIX host systems one character at a time. Using the DECwindows TE en-
 ables Digital's character-mode terminals to emulate IBM's Block-mode
 style of computing by buffering outbound IBM data in the DECnet host

 system's memory before displaying it, as a single block, on the Dig-
 ital terminal. The Digital terminal then transmits the screen form to
 the IBM Host system via one of the DECnet/SNA transport products.

 Translating ASCII and EBCDIC Data

 Digital systems use ASCII code to represent data, while IBM systems
 use EBCDIC. The DECwindows TE contains built-in translation tables that
 convert ISO Latin character input (given in ASCII code) to IBM multi-
 national EBCDIC code for transfer through the DECnet/SNA Transport soft-
 ware. Users of the DECwindows TE can modify these translation tables
 to fit most language needs.

 Starting the DECwindows TE

 Users can invoke the DECwindows TE from the VMS command line or choose
 a custom menu selection on FileView or Session Manager.

 Users invoking the DECwindows TE from a VMS command line use the SNATERM
 command, along with DECwindows qualifiers to specify the IBM system
 and system resources to which they want to connect. While the DECWin-
 dows TE utility is running, its display window is formatted in the same
 style as a 3270 display station with the option of 3270, 3279-S3G or
 3192-G terminal types. Exiting the TE returns control to the VMS Op-
 erating System.
