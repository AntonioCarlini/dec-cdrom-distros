 PRODUCT NAME:  Storage Library System for OpenVMS[1], Version 2.2 SPD
 29.67.05

 DESCRIPTION

 Data centers have three pressing storage management needs: system backup
 /restore complexity, effective archiving/retrieval, and lack of on-
 line data space. VAX Storage Library System (SLS) helps the system man-
 ager address all of these issues.

 VAX SLS is a complete, flexible tape management system for OpenVMS.
 VAX SLS manages a tape volume through the volume's lifecycle, auto-
 mates backups, provides for system and user archiving, and makes it
 easy to find files stored on tapes. VAX SLS also provides a remote backup
 facility, and is therefore a major component in "lights out" data cen-
 ter operations.

 Key Features

 The key capabilities of VAX SLS file archiving and backups are:

 o  Automatic scheduling of system backups, with backups skipped on des-
    ignated holidays or other defined periods.

 o  Centralized services for user-requested backup and archiving op-
    erations.

 o  Remote backup and archiving operations directly between disks and
    tape drives located on different systems within a DECnet network
    without staging of data on disks.

 The   terms OpenVMS and VMS refer to the OpenVMS operating system.

                                                         AE-LB73F-TE

 

 o  Online maintenance of information about backed up and archived files
    and volumes to allow quick retrieval of the files or restoration
    of disk volumes without knowing the names of the tape volumes in
    which the data was saved.

 o  Support for operatorless backup operations using the TA90E, TA91,
    Tx8x7 automatic tape cartridge loader, and the RV64 optical juke-
    box. Optional support for the StorageTek® automated cartridge server.

 o  Effective use of all media capacity by appending multiple sets of
    backed up or archived files to the same volume or volume set.

 o  Direct positioning to the start of each save set file during a re-
    store operation using saved information about the tape position of
    each save set file.

 o  DCL and menu interfaces for users, operators, and storage admin-
    istrators (with online help).

 o  Customization features to meet a variety of operational and site
    requirements.

 The key capabilities of VAX SLS removable media and device management
 are:

 o  Media life cycle control including maintenance of volume retention
    period, availability status, location, and scheduling of dates when
    volumes are to move offsite and return.

 o  Maintenance of counters for each volume noting the number of times
    a volume has been mounted and the number of errors associated with
    the volume. These counters are used to schedule cleaning of the vol-
    umes when the counters exceed threshold values.

 o  Allocation control of media based on customer-defined media pools.

 o  Ability to print external tape labels in a customizable format.

 o  Built-in report generation and custom report generation capabil-
    ity.

 o  Security features to prevent unauthorized media or device use.

 o  "Round robin" device allocation to even drive usage.

                                  2

 

 o  In a VAXcluster environment, automatic failure recovery from the
    loss of a processor to allow continuous access to the VAX SLS databases.

 Supported Media and Devices

 VAX SLS software manages the media and devices for all OpenVMS-supported
 reel-to-reel and cartridge tape drives, the RV20 write-once optical
 disk drive, and the RV64 optical disk jukebox. Remote Tape Facility-
 RTF®

 RTF software is distributed within the VAX SLS software. It is option-
 ally installed during the installation procedure for VAX SLS software.

 This software allows a tape or optical disk to be accessed from other
 OpenVMS nodes across the DECnet network for backups and archives. RTF
 consists of these components:

 o  RTF servers that execute tape I/O requests on behalf of a remote
    client.

    Servers are located on systems that have tape drives attached or
    that can access drives through the VAX/OpenVMS TMSCP Server.

 o  RTF clients that provide the communications interface between ap-
    plications reading or writing data to a tape drive and the RTF servers.

 VAX SLS software makes access to remote drives transparent to SLS backup
 and archive operations by issuing RTF commands as appropriate if a des-
 ignated drive is a remote one. VAX SLS software also manages volume
 load requests to remote systems to allow operatorless backups or to
 communicate with a console operator.

 Options

 To support a variety of configuration requirements, three VAX SLS li-
 cense options are available:

 VAX SLS


                                  3

 

 VAX SLS software provides users at the node or VAXcluster at which it
 is executing with access to the full functionality described above.
 VAX SLS software manages:

 o  The "VAX SLS media database," a VAX RMS file which describes all
    removable storage media known to VAX SLS software, and,

 o  "VAX SLS history files" in which information about user files backed
    up or archived under VAX SLS control at the local node is recorded.
    A node or VAXcluster executing VAX SLS software provides media man-
    agement services both for itself and for any "client nodes" con-
    nected to it. At least one VAX SLS license in the network is re-
    quired for use of the VAX SLS product.

 VAX SLS REMOTE

 VAX SLS REMOTE software provides backup scheduling and archiving ser-
 vices for the node or VAXcluster on which it is executing, and acts
 as a client of another node executing VAX SLS software when it requires
 media management services.

 A node or VAXcluster executing VAX SLS REMOTE software in communica-
 tion with another node or VAXcluster executing VAX SLS software pro-
 vides users with the full functionality described above.

 Like VAX SLS software, VAX SLS REMOTE software maintains "VAX SLS his-
 tory files" in which it records information about user files backed
 up or archived locally under its control. The node executing VAX SLS
 REMOTE software communicates using DECnet software to a "server node"
 running VAX SLS software. The "server node" maintains the VAX SLS me-
 dia database. The VAX SLS media database contains information about
 volume location and pool access authorization.

 Each VAX SLS REMOTE node must be connected to a server node execut-
 ing VAX SLS software for media management services. Any number of VAX
 SLS REMOTE nodes may be connected to a single VAX SLS node.

 VAX SLS ACS


                                  4

 

 VAX SLS ACS supports the StorageTek 4400 automated cartridge server.
 This license is required in order to interface the StorageTek ACS to
 VAX SLS.

 The SLS ACS license is loaded in the system together with either the
 SLS or SLS REMOTE licenses.
