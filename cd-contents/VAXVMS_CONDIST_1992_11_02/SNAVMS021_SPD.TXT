     PRODUCT NAME:  VMS/SNA, Version 2.1                 SPD 27.01.06

     DESCRIPTION

     VMS/SNA is a layered software product that allows suitably
     configured VMS systems to directly participate in an IBM[R]
     Systems Network Architecture (SNA) networking environment.
     After installing the VMS/SNA software and one or more DECnet/SNA
     Access Routines, users can perform functions such as accessing
     IBM[R] application programs or other system resources, act as a
     3270 display station, exchange data files and documents with an
     IBM Host, and implement distributed application programs that
     run between the VMS and IBM systems.

     Architecturally, a VAX system running VMS/SNA appears to the
     SNA network as a Physical Unit Type 2 node, and is attached to
     the SNA network through a synchronous communications device to
     an IBM 37xx Communications Controller. The VMS/SNA software
     supports one synchronous communication line at speeds from
     1.2K bps to 64K bps, depending on the communications device
     being used and a maximum of 16-64 concurrent SNA logical unit
     sessions depending on the VAX CPU it is running on. Both local
     and remote connections are supported from VMS/SNA into the IBM
     SNA network, using switched or leased lines in point-to-point
     or multi-point environments. VMS/SNA also supports connections
     over X.25 switched virtual circuits using Qualified Logical Link
     Control (QLLC). VAX Packetnet System Interface (VAX P.S.I.) or
     VAX P.S.I. Access is required for SNA over X.25 connections.

     VMS/SNA can send Record Formatted Maintenance Statistics
     (RECFMS) messages to the IBM system. These messages contain
     counters requested by the IBM Netview[R] Hardware Monitor using
     Request Maintenance Statistics (REQMS) messages. Not all RECFMS

     Users may configure their IBM line to activate more LUs than
     the maximum number of sessions allowed for the processor. The
     maximum number of active LUs is twice the number of maximum
     sessions. For example, 64 LUs may be activated on a MicroVAX
     3600.

     Whether the connection is via X.25 or SDLC, the functions pro-
     vided by the VMS/SNA software will be comparable to those pro-
     vided by the DECnet/SNA Gateway product. Systems wishing access
     to the SNA environment must be configured with the appropriate
     DECnet/SNA VMS Access Routines. For additional information on
     which Access Routines are supported with VMS/SNA, consult the
     table in the Optional Software section of this SPD.

     VMS/SNA supports connections over X.25 switched virtual cir-
     cuits (QLLC) as well as SDLC circuits. The QLLC circuit can be
     configured to use either Incoming or Outgoing X.25 Switched Vi-
     tual Ciruits (SVCs). VMS/SNA does not support X.25 Permanent
     Virtual Ciruits (PVCs). VMS/SNA requires IBM Network Packet
     Switched Interface (NPSI) in order to use QLLC circuits. The IBM
     NPSI software should be generated to support "Boundary Network
     Node, Qualified Logical Link Control" (BNN QLLC) type-3 switched
     virtual circuits.

     VMS/SNA also supports the following optional facilities for QLLC
     circuits:

     o  Flow Control Negotiation

     o  Reverse Charging

     VMS/SNA Management Utilities

     VMS/SNA provides the management utilities SNANCP and SNAEVL.
     SNANCP is used to manage and monitor VMS/SNA components such as
     line, circuit, PU, and LU. SNANCP provides the human interface
     for the Digital System Manager to monitor, control, and trou-
     bleshoot VMS/SNA and its IBM/SNA environment. All management
     functions pertaining to VMS/SNA are performed on the VAX. The
     SNANCP commands allow users to display and modify information
     pertaining to the line, circuit, PU, LUs, and access names. On-
     line help is provided. SNAEVL is used to log events generated by
     these components.

     Management of the VMS/SNA node should be viewed as part of the
     Digital environment; the management of the line connecting the
     VMS system to the IBM system is a joint responsibility of the
     IBM and Digital system managers.

     VMS/SNA Problem Isolation and Determination Tools

     SNA Protocol Trace Utility (SNATRACE) and NETTRACE are prob-
     lem determination tools that provide frame level tracing of
     a circuit to help in debugging application programs, as well
     as identifying system problems. A privileged user can run a
     trace at the Physical Unit (PU) level, SDLC level, or session
     level. The trace feature is helpful in identifying an error
     for remedial action. NETTRACE can also be used to trace QLLC
     circuits.

     The VMS/SNA Installation Verification Procedure (IVP),
     SNAVMS$IVP, is also useful for problem isolation. SNAVMS$IVP
     is run separately from any Access Routine, and may be used to
     verify connectivity to specific IBM applications over specific
     LU sessions. In failure cases, SNAVMS$IVP displays an expanded
     error text that attempts to diagnose the cause of failure.
