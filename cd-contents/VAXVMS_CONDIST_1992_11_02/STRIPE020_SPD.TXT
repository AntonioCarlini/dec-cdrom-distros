     PRODUCT NAME:  VAX Disk Striping Driver for VMS, Version 2.0 SPD
     31.66.01

     DESCRIPTION

     The VAX Disk Striping Driver implements disk striping for the
     VMS Operating System. The product provides the ability for users
     to create one or more stripesets, each comprised of two or more
     physical disk drives and represented to the user application
     (and operating system) as a single pseudo-device. Stripesets
     must be composed of disks of a single type. Full VAXcluster
     support is provided with Striping V2.0 (with VMS V5.4).

     Disk striping interleaves multiple disks to improve I/O per-
     formance in the same way that high-performance memory systems
     interleave memory banks. In each case, data requests are de-
     composed and distributed to physical storage components that
     process those requests in parallel.

     There are three types of I/O performance problems that disk
     striping can help relieve. They are:

     1. Applications that require very high data transfer rates

     2. Systems in which static disk load balancing is ineffective

     3. Applications that are prohibited from distributing data
        across multiple disks but need higher throughput than is
        available from a single disk

     The pseudo-device responds to all of the I/O operations defined
     for ordinary disk drives including physical, logical, and vir-
     tual I/O. As a result, the striping driver is transparent to all
     VMS software other than diagnostics. However, a stripeset may
     not be a VMS boot or dump device, and BACKUPs must be done on
     the pseudo-device, not on the member units.

     A Digital Command Language (DCL) interface (CLI) is provided
     that enables the privileged user to define stripesets and to
     create and destroy the pseudo-devices that represent them. It
     also allows statistics and configuration information associated
     with the pseudo-devices to be listed.
