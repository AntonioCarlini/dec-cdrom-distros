                                       KMS11-BD                    
                                       KMS1P                       

Notes:

^  DSH32 and DST32 are not supported on VAXstation 2000 systems

^  DMV11, DSV11 and KMV1A are not supported on MicroVAX I or VAXstation I 
   systems

^  The use of UNIBUS options on a VAXBI system with a UNIBUS Adapter is
   not supported unless specified in Table 2

^  The DMB32, DMF32 and DSH32 are multi-function devices. Only the Device 
   Driver for the synchronous ports are included in the VAX Wide Area Network 
   Device Drivers. 

^  The DMB32 must be revision J or later for applications using GENBYTE,
   HDLC or SDLC protocols.

^  The DMF32 must be revision J or later for applications using HDLC protocol.

^  Some VMS synchronous device drivers are still included in the VMS Operating
   System or VMS layered products. The synchronous port device drivers for 
   devices marked with an asterisk are included in VAX Wide Area Network 
   Device Drivers only.

The VAX Wide Area Network Device Drivers includes Device Drivers that are
reserved for use by DIGITAL software products as well as Device Drivers that
offer a supported User ($QIO) interface. Table 2 lists the Device Driver
characteristics. The table entries indicate the maximum permitted line speeds
in kilobits/second for each of the line protocols supported by the individual
drivers. Refer to Table 2 at the end of this SPD. 

The Device Drivers all support full duplex and half duplex operation,
where appropriate to the protocol. DDCMP and SDLC Device drivers all
support both point-to-point and multipoint tributary operation. 
``Bisync'' refers to the IBM (r) implementation of bisynchronous protocol. The 
Genbyte protocol is a general byte-orientated protocol for use with 
User-written framing routines. 

The maximum permitted line speed is also dependent on the line interface
standard used and must not exceed 19.2 Kbps for an RS232/V.24 standard
interface. There may be additional line speed restrictions for other line
interface standards, refer to the product descriptions for the synchronous
interfaces for more information. The DIGITAL communications layered products
may not necessarily support operation of the synchronous interface at the
maximum speed supported by the device driver. Refer to the appropriate Software
Product Description for the DIGITAL communications layered product for precise
details of supported configurations.

In all cases, the data throughput over the synchronous lines is dependent
on the user applications and system environment.

The device drivers all support modem control signal operation. Please refer
to the product descriptions for the appropriate synchronous interface for
details of the modem signals supported by an individual device.

Notes:

^   Where two line speeds are shown, for example 256/64, the higher speed
    refers to single line operation of the option, the lower speed applies
    when connections are made to both lines. 

^   SJDRIVER and SLDRIVER (DSV11 and DSB32) support the use of different
    protocols on each of the two lines of the device.

^   There are alternative device drivers available for the KMV1A, KMS11-BD
    and KMS1P which have a supported User ($QIO) interface. These are not
    included with the VAX Wide Area Network Device Drivers. Contact your
    local DIGITAL office for more information.

^   XDDRIVER, for use with the DMV11, also supports DDCMP multipoint controller
    operation.      

^   There are three Device Drivers for the DPV11 supplied, usage depends on
    the protocol required. Only one may be used at a time.

^   There are two Device Drivers for the DUP11 supplied, usage depends on
    the protocol required. Only one may be used at a time.

^   Only the RS232 variant of the KMV1A is supported by the this Device
    Driver.

^   The KMS11-BD is an eight-line device. All eight lines can be used at
    the maximum permitted line speed, refer to the Load Tables contained
    in the VAX P.S.I. Software Product Description for Load Units for this
    device.    

^   The DMF32 with XGDRIVER is supported on a VAXBI system fitted with a
    DWBUA UNIBUS adapter for DDCMP and Genbyte protocol use only.

^   The DMR11 with XMDRIVER is supported on a VAXBI system fitted with a
    DWBUA UNIBUS adapter. Refer to the DECnet-VAX SPD (25.03.xx) for more
    information.    

^   The DUP11 with XJDRIVER (Bisync protocol) is supported on a VAXBI system 
    fitted with a DWBUA UNIBUS adapter for VAX 8200, VAX 8250, VAX 8300,
    VAX 8350, VAX 8500, VAX 8530, VAX 8550, VAX 8700 and VAX 8800 systems
    only.
