DESCRIPTION
 
The VMS/ULTRIX Connection is a VMS layered software product that 
promotes resource sharing between VMS servers and UNIX (tm) clients.  
The VMS/ULTRIX Connection supports networking, file access, and 
application development between VMS servers and UNIX clients. The 
VMS/ULTRIX Connection includes two major components:

	^  An ARPANET communication system 

	^  A Network File System (NFS (tm)) server. 

The product also includes a system management interface for setting up 
and monitoring the communication and NFS environments.			
 
ARPANET Communication System
 
The VMS/ULTRIX Connection supports industry standard networking on VMS
through a set of ARPANET protocols. The supported protocols are based on
the 4.3 Berkely Software Distribution (BSD) and include:

^ Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
 
^ Internet Protocol (IP)
 
^ Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
 
^ Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
 
^ User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

^ File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

The VMS/ULTRIX Connection includes a QIO programming interface so users
can write applications to access the lower-level protocols.  Users can
write networking applications in any VAX language using the standard
VAX/VMS ASSIGN, DASSGN, and QIO system services.
 
The VMS/ULTRIX Connection also supports bi-directional file transfer 
sessions between the VMS server and the UNIX client.  The FTP session
allows the client to view the filesystem structure on the remote server.

	Note:

	^   Version 1.0 of the VMS/ULTRIX Connection does NOT support  
      	    TELNET, SMTP, or the ULTRIX ``r'' commands such as rcp and rsh.

	^   The VMS/ULTRIX Connection supports static routing on the 
	    VMS server.  Full routing capabilities for a wide area	      
	    network require an ULTRIX host.

Network File System
 
The VMS/ULTRIX Connection supports NFS Version 2.0 protocol specifications.  
NFS is an application layer protocol that provides clients with transparent 
access to remote file services.  Version 1.0 of the VMS/ULTRIX Connection 
provides an NFS server on VMS for UNIX clients.  Version 1.0 does not 
support VMS clients.

The NFS server promotes data sharing among clients by providing a central
data storage facility for VMS and UNIX files.  The NFS server provides
two types of file access for UNIX clients:

	^   Client access to VMS files
	^   Client access to ULTRIX-compatible files


Client Access to VMS Files

UNIX clients can access VMS files stored in an RMS StreamLF format on
the server.  StreamLF files are analogous to the ``byte'' stream files common
on UNIX systems.  Clients can access other types of RMS files, such as
ISAM files.  However, the ISAM structure and file contents will be passed 
to the UNIX client in sequential bytes.  A programmer would have to be 
aware of the specific ISAM structure to make use of the file contents on the
UNIX client.

Client access to the VMS file system is subject to standard VMS file 
conventions.  These conventions include eight levels of directory nesting, and 
filenames with the following syntax:
  
File Name	File Type	File Version Number
 
39 Characters .	39 Characters .	INTEGER 
 
Permitted characters are A-Z, a-z, 0-9, underscore (_), hyphen (-), and
dollar sign ($). All alphabetic characters are interpreted as uppercase
characters. Filename and type cannot begin with an underscores, hyphen, 
or dollar sign. Version numbers must be decimal numbers in the range 1 to 
32767. You can refer to a version number in a relative manner by specifying
a zero or a negative number. Specifying zero locates the most recent version of
the file, and specifying -1 locates the next most recent version.

Client Access to ULTRIX-Compatible Files
 
The ULTRIX-compatible file system on VMS provides clients with
the same filesystem functionality as an ULTRIX server.  To the remote 
client, the VMS NFS server looks like a large ULTRIX file cabinet. 
The ULTRIX files are accessed according to the rules of the ULTRIX File System 
(UFS). UFS supports 4.3BSD Fast File System semantics, which are a superset    
of the SVID (System V Interface Definition) Issue 2, Volume 1, file system
semantics. The UFS rules permit up to 255 levels of directory nesting and 
filenames of 255 characters.  Files within these ULTRIX  file systems may 
also be accessed by applications executing on the VMS system.  A callable 
interface is provided to translate the ULTRIX pathname to a VMS filename.
 
Note: Version 1.0 of the VMS/ULTRIX Connection does not support programmer 
      access to the NFS Remote Procedure Call (RPC) and External Data
      Representation (XDR) mechanism.

System Management
 
The VMS/ULTRIX Connection provides DCL commands to control and monitor
the communication and NFS subsystems.  Commands are provided to 
define hosts, startup/shutdown/monitor network interfaces, and control
how/what workstation clients access files on the VMS system.  

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

VAX, MicroVAX or VAXstation configuration as specified in the System 
Support Addendum (SSA 25.A4.00-x).
   
SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS*

Installing the VMS/ULTRIX Connection requires:

    VMS Operating System or MicroVMS Operating System
    
*Refer to the System Support Addendum for availability and required
 versions of prerequisite software (SSA 25.A4.00-x).

Client access to the VMS/ULTRIX Connection requires:

    A UNIX operating system which supports the protocols specified by
    NFS V2.0 and the following Defense Data Network (DDN) Request for
    Comments (RFCs):

 		PROTOCOLS	RFC

		IP		791
		ICMP		792
		TCP		793
		ARP		826
		FTP		959

    UNIX systems that meet these requirements include The ULTRIX-32 Operating
    System V2.2, ULTRIX Worksystem Software V1.1, and the systems
    listed in Appendix A.
