PRODUCT NAME: VAX DATATRIEVE, Version 4.2                       SPD 25.44.20


DESCRIPTION

VAX DATATRIEVE is a query and report system for the VMS and MicroVMS
Operating Systems. It provides a uniform access method for data stored by
RMS, VAX Rdb/VMS, and VAX DBMS files on VMS and data residing in certain IBM
mainframe databases accessed through VIDA with IDMS/R (tm).  Using VAX 
DATATRIEVE, a novice or experienced user can retrieve or modify data 
without considering the underlying storage method or physical location. 

VAX DATATRIEVE presents information in several different formats. Information
can be displayed using simple defaults or can be reported on through a more
flexible report writer. Information can be displayed on a terminal, printed
on a hard-copy device, or written to a file.  Information can also be
displayed with user-defined VAX FMS and VAX TDMS forms or presented
graphically. Hard copy of the graphic display can be printed on a printer
attached to the terminal. DATATRIEVE also provides an efficient way to access
information stored on other VAX, PDP-11, or DECSYSTEM-20 systems linked by
DECnet. 

Modes of Operation

VAX DATATRIEVE can be used interactively to retrieve, modify, store, or
delete data using a simple set of commands. Frequently used combinations of
commands can be stored as named procedures and invoked by name. Programs
written in other VAX languages can call VAX DATATRIEVE, allowing them to be
independent of underlying data storage methods and physical location. 

Data Dictionary

VAX DATATRIEVE is dictionary driven. Data descriptions are stored in and
retrieved from the VAX Common Data Dictionary/Plus (CDD/Plus). VAX 
DATATRIEVE includes commands to store, examine, modify, and delete 
definitions in the CDD/Plus, and can use definitions stored by other 
VAX layered products, such as the VAX DBMS Data Definition Language (DDL) 
or VAX Rdb/VMS DDL. 

Protection 

Protection is handled by the VAX Common Data Dictionary/Plus. VAX DATATRIEVE 
can access data only through definitions in the VAX Common Data Dictionary/
Plus. Locking the definition prevents the user from accessing the data. Access
control can be based on name, login account, password, or terminal class
(local, remote, or dial-up). 

Remote Data Access 

VAX DATATRIEVE provides access to data on remote VAX, PDP-11, or DECSYSTEM-20
systems, provided that DATATRIEVE has been installed on the remote system.
VAX DATATRIEVE will use the local data dictionary on the remote node and
divide processing between the host and the remote system to minimize traffic
over the Phase IV DECnet communications link. 

For the Nonprogrammer

VAX DATATRIEVE provides the novice user with a tutorial mode, called GUIDE
Mode.                                                                        

VAX DATATRIEVE offers ADT, the Application Design Tool for the more
experienced user who wants to define his own data structures. ADT takes the
user step-by-step through the definition of a domain based on an RMS data
file. 

If VAX DATATRIEVE is used on the same information by experienced and novice
users, the novice user can use the full power of the language by invoking
procedures designed by the more experienced user. 

For the Programmer

VAX DATATRIEVE is a highly structured, nonprocedural language that provides
automatic access optimization, data type conversion, and data validation.
Looping and control structures, such as IF THEN ELSE, BEGIN END, REPEAT,
WHILE, CHOICE and FOR (each record) can be combined and nested to create
complex, powerful commands. 

VAX DATATRIEVE responds to programming errors with clear, explicit error
messages. The user can issue an EDIT command to invoke a text editor with the
erroneous statement as input text, correct the mistake, and resubmit the
command.  This editor can be either EDT, TPU or VAX Language-Sensitive Editor
(LSE), and is controlled by a user logical name assignment. 

Data Definition

VAX DATATRIEVE stores the fixed attributes of each record in the record
definition. In addition to COBOL-like attributes, DATATRIEVE accepts
validation criteria, fields whose values are computed at run-time, missing
value expressions, and default values. 

VAX DATATRIEVE supports most data types used by VAX FORTRAN, VAX COBOL, VAX
PL/I, VAX C, and VAX BASIC. 

VAX DATATRIEVE supports Quadword keys in RMS files.  VAX DATATRIEVE also
supports Varying String and Segmented String data types in VAX Rdb/VMS.

Views

A VIEW is an alternative description of data. It can restrict a user by
including only some of the data items in a record, or it can combine data
items from several files. Information can be linked through common values (or
set linkages in VAX DBMS) to produce complex hierarchical structures. Using a
predefined view, even a novice user can access and display data from several
files at once with the same commands used on a single file. Data accessed
through a view can be printed and modified, but data cannot be stored or
erased using a view. 

Program Access

VAX DATATRIEVE can be called from any language that supports the VMS calling
standard. DATATRIEVE automatically converts data from its storage format to
the format expected by the program. All of the features of interactive VAX
DATATRIEVE are available through the call interface and use the same syntax. 

Storage Methods

VAX DATATRIEVE uses a single, consistent syntax to access information stored 
in VAX RMS files (sequential, relative, or indexed), VAX DBMS and VAX Rdb/VMS
databases.  VAX DATATRIEVE can also access information stored in certain IBM 
mainframe databases through the use of VIDA with IDMS/R (tm).  Data from all 
these sources can be combined into a single VIEW.

If access to a VAX DBMS database involves explicit set walking, or if records 
must be manually connected or disconnected from sets, the user can employ VAX 
DATATRIEVE language features that are specific to VAX DBMS access.  However, 
if the user employs VIEWS or implicit set walking, VAX DATATRIEVE can access 
information in VAX DBMS databases using the same syntax used for data from 
an RMS file.

Report Generation

The VAX DATATRIEVE REPORT statement produces formatted reports without
formatting statements, but allows the user to override its default format
when necessary. A title, column headers, and page numbers are produced
automatically. Simple (AT TOP, AT BOTTOM) statements create page headers and
trailers for control breaks, or a report summary. All of VAX DATATRIEVE's
statistical functions and value expressions are available within the REPORT
statement. Reports can be generated from data stored in VAX RMS files, VAX
DBMS and VAX Rdb/VMS databases, certain IBM mainframe databases accessed 
through the use of VIDA with IDMS/R (tm), or DATATRIEVE VIEWS that combine 
any of these without any change in the syntax of the REPORT statement. 

Graphics

VAX DATATRIEVE includes a number of predefined plots invoked with a single
command that takes standard record selection expressions as arguments and
creates bar, pie, line and scattered point plots of the information selected.
Plots can be displayed on a DIGITAL Graphics terminals such as the VT340 (See
OPTIONAL HARDWARE, below, for a list of specific supported terminals). Hard
copy can be obtained from terminals by attaching a DIGITAL device which
supports the SIXEL protocol (e.g. LA50, LA75). VAX DATATRIEVE does not
support graphics on VAXstation systems. 

Compatibility

VAX DATATRIEVE is largely upward compatible from DATATRIEVE-11 and
PRO/DATATRIEVE. A utility is provided to extract the contents of a
DATATRIEVE-11 dictionary in a format to be entered into the VAX Common Data
Dictionary. Some syntactic and semantic differences do exist between
DATATRIEVE-11, PRO/DATATRIEVE and VAX DATATRIEVE.  Procedures copied with the
extract utility can require modification.
