PRODUCT NAME:  VAX RALLY, Version 2.1               SPD 27.03.04

DESCRIPTION

VAX RALLY provides a powerful fourth generation environment for developing 
applications. As an integrated package, RALLY provides tools to define  Rdb/VMS 
databases, forms, reports, menus, and on-line help for the application user. 

Application developers can use RALLY's menu interface and extensive defaulting 
capabilities to create simple applications quickly. More sophisticated 
applications can be created in the RALLY editing environment. Once applications 
are created they can be:

oo Run directly from within RALLY 

oo Installed in a VAX TEAMDATA directory *                          

oo Accessed directly from an ALL-IN-1 menu *

oo Run from other 3GL programs *                                      

oo Run from DCL *

  *On systems where VAX RALLY Development Option (also known as the VAX 
  RALLY Base Option) or VAX RALLY Run-Time Option are installed.                      
  
Features

VAX RALLY offers the application developer the following features and 
capabilities:

Application Development Tools

RALLY provides a fourth generation environment for creating VAX Rdb/VMS   
and RMS applications.  RALLY tools include database creation facilities, 
forms, reports, menus and a built-in procedural language (ADL). Generated 
applications can run in one or more user-controlled windows on the 
terminal screen. 

RALLY applications can be run at VMS command level, from a VAX TEAMDATA 
directory or, after installation by an ALL-IN-1 system manager, directly 
from an ALL-IN-1 menu. Application data can come from multiple data 
sources, including local and remote Rdb/VMS databases, RMS files, 
TEAMDATA tables and DBMS databases which have been defined as VAX 
DATATRIEVE domains. 
    									 
``Simple Applications Simply'' Capabilities

RALLY provides tools for less experienced application developers to get 
started designing and building their applications. Business systems 
analysts can take advantage of the extensive defaulting capabilities of 
the product to design the databases, forms, reports and menus that make 
up, for example, a simple data entry application. As the user gains more 
experience, such simple applications can be expanded and modified. 

Database Creation/Maintenance Features

RALLY provides a menu-driven tool for the creation and maintenance of 
Rdb/VMS databases in a style consistent with the other RALLY application 
definition system facilities. The database builder allows  the definer to 
define databases, relations, fields and indexes.        

Unified Forms and Reports

The centerpiece of VAX RALLY is its integrated form/report processor. One 
RALLY subsystem supports both forms and reports. If the application 
developer so allows, anything that can be done with a form can also be 
done with a report, and vice versa.  Depending on how the application 
definer specifies access to a form/report (that is, input only, output 
only, query, update), users interact with an object as a form, a report, 
template for queries, or as an editable report. 

RALLY automatically generates a form/report using the information from a 
database description. The definer can then use the form/report screen 
editor to customize the form/report. RALLY form/reports can include 
scrolled regions, field-level validation mechanisms, video highlighting, 
complex completion handlers, and can span multiple screens. 

Besides allowing users to create complex reports with totaling and     
subtotaling, multiple data source access and flexible formatting, the 
RALLY form/report processor lets the user actually manipulate the 
underlying data dynamically through the screen form/report. This means 
that if the application definer so allows, a user can edit a form/report, 
browse through it, change values, add/delete records and then either   
save the changes or quit from the report. Changes that affect computed 
fields are reflected instantly on the screen.  RALLY also allows users to 
create control break reports.                     


Menu Creation

Application flow control is typically controlled by menus. RALLY        
provides a menu definition tool that lets application definers          
create user menus in a variety of styles. Menus similar to VAX            
TEAMDATA strip menus are the default style for simple, defaulted 
applications. However, other menu formats are also supported.          

Integrated Dictionary and RMS Support

RALLY supports integration with VAX CDD/Plus in the following areas:  
 
oo Storage in VAX CDD/Plus of VAX Rdb/VMS metadata created or changed by 
  RALLY

oo Storage in VAX CDD/Plus of RALLY application information to support  
  impact analysis                                                       

oo Access to RMS file and record definitions given a pathname

oo Access to VAX DATATRIEVE domains (READ-ONLY) given a dictionary 
  pathname
 
Built-In Application Development Language (ADL)

RALLY includes an integrated application development language for such 
things as special field validation operations, special-purpose         
arithmetic computations and unusual database management interactions.  
ADL is intended to supplement an application composed PRIMARILY of other 
RALLY entities (for example, forms, reports, menus) with computations and 
flow-of-control. 

Access to Third Generation Language (3GL) Programs

While most RALLY application requirements are satisfied using the tools 
provided with the product, application developers with special 
requirements can create applications that directly call external          
routines (for example, a COBOL routine, or VMS RTL routine, or a VMS      
Utility).                                                                 

Optional Integration with ALL-IN-1 and VAX TEAMDATA

RALLY provides integration with ALL-IN-1 in the following areas:

oo Function keys are (by default) similar to ALL-IN-1 and WPS-PLUS

oo Support for ALL-IN-1 GOLD-Interrupt facility

RALLY applications can be run from a TEAMDATA directory, an ALL-IN-1   
menu or directly from DCL.                                             

Comprehensive On-line Help

At every stage in the development process, the definer can get 
context-sensitive help on particular areas being worked.  RALLY 
continually makes the definer aware of appropriate values for fields, 
options, and variables. 

RALLY allows definers to define context sensitive interactive    help, 
legend, and error messages for an application.                      

Other Features

oo Date arithmetic
      
oo Computed fields and aggregate functions

oo Password security for entire applications or selected application parts 
  (for example, forms or reports)

oo Single-user or multi-user access to Rdb/VMS relations          

oo Ability to save keystroke sequence in named macro files

oo Virtual multi-tasking with windowing

oo Default function key mappings similar to ALL-IN-1/WPS-PLUS; optional 
  EDT function key mappings included

oo A Callable Interface                                                    
  
oo Application reporting utility to generate reports describing the      
  entire application, single objects, all objects of a single type and 
  cross-references between the RALLY application and the database.      
    
VAX RALLY Run-Time Option

The VAX RALLY Run-Time Option is available separately and is a subset of      
VAX RALLY Development Option.  The VAX RALLY Run-Time Option supports the     
execution of VAX RALLY applications on a target machine that have been        
developed on a host machine using the VAX RALLY Development Option.          
Application development is not supported by the VAX RALLY Run-Time 
Option.
