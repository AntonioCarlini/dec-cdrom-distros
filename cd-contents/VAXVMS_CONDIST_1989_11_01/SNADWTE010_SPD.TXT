DECwindows DECnet/SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator for VMS, V1.0	SPD 31.58.00

DESCRIPTION

The DECwindows DECnet/SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator for VMS (DW VMS 3270 TE) is a 
layered software product that allows users of DIGITAL-supported workstations on 
suitably configured VMS systems within a DECnet network to interactively access 
IBM (R) mainframe-based applications.   The applications were originally 
developed for use with IBM 3270 display stations in a System Network 
Architecture (SNA) networking environment.

Access to IBM mainframe applications is gained by means of the DECnet/SNA 
Gateway or VMS/SNA software.  

In normal operation, an IBM system transfers a formatted screen much like a 
"form" or "panel" to the 3270 block mode terminal and the user fills in any 
form required data.  When complete, the form is transmitted to the IBM host as 
a single unit. This mechanism is emulated with a DIGITAL character mode 
terminal by buffering the "form" in the DECnet host's memory and displaying it 
on the terminal.  The screen "form" is sent to the IBM host system by means of 
the DECnet/SNA Gateway or VMS/SNA.

Translation tables on the respective systems convert ISO Latin terminal input 
to a subset of IBM multinational EBCDIC code for transfer through either the 
DECnet/SNA Gateway or VMS/SNA software.  These translation tables can be 
modified to fit most language needs.

If customized, DW VMS 3270 TE can be invoked by the users from the VMS FileView 
applications menu or from a VMS command line.  When DW VMS 3270 TE is invoked 
from the VMS FileView applications menu, DW VMS 3270 TE options are specified 
in a DECwindows dialog box.  When DW VMS 3270 TE is invoked from a VMS command 
line, command line qualifiers are used to specify the IBM system and system 
resources to which the users wishes to connect.   While the emulation utility 
is operating, the display window will be formatted in a fashion similar to a 
3270 display station with the option of 3270, 3279-S3G or 3192-G terminal 
types. When the user has completed work on the IBM system, the 3270 emulator is 
dismissed and control is returned to the VMS command level or to the VMS 
FileView utility.
