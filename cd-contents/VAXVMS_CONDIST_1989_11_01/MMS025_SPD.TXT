VAX DEC/MMS, Version 2.5                            SPD 26.03.12

DESCRIPTION

VAX DEC/MMS is a software tool designed to enhance programmer productivity. 
It determines what components in a described software system have changed, 
and rebuilds the system in an optimal way. 

When some modules of a software system are modified, dependent modules may 
need to be recompiled.  VAX DEC/MMS determines which modules need to be 
recompiled, and performs the appropriate actions to ensure that the 
software system is recompiled and linked with all the latest changes. 
Additionally, VAX DEC/MMS has the ability to interact with VAX DEC/CMS 
(Code Management System, SPD 25.52.xx) and other VMS software productivity 
tools. 

VAX DEC/MMS is included in the VAXset (SPD 27.07.xx) software development 
tool package.  This package provides simplified ordering and maintenance of 
various tools.  See the appropriate Software Product Descriptions for more     
information on VAXset.

Features

oo   Integration with other VMS software productivity tools

Note:	      Installations utilizing VAX Ada should note that many of the 
              features of VAX DEC/MMS are duplicated by the ACS library 
              manager subsystem for Ada-encoded programs.  VAX DEC/MMS 
              retains its benefits as a productivity aide for such 
              installations primarily for non-Ada programming.
