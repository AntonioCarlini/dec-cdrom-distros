PRODUCT NAME: DECnet/SNA Gateway                     SPD 25.C6.01
              for Synchronous Transport, Version 1.1
                                                            
DESCRIPTION 
  
DECnet/SNA Gateway for Synchronous Transport (DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST) is a
member of the DECnet/SNA Gateway product family. This family consists of 
hardware and software products that allow users to bi-directionally exchange 
information and share resources between suitably configured DIGITAL systems in 
a DECnet environment and IBM (R) systems in a Systems Network Architecture 
(SNA) environment. 

Users on one or more DIGITAL systems can simultaneously perform functions 
such as accessing IBM application programs or other system resources,  
act as a 3270 display station, perform data transfer between DIGITAL and IBM 
file systems, exchange electronic documents and mail messages, submit jobs to 
IBM batch subsystems acting as a Remote Job Entry workstation, and implement 
distributed, task-to-task, application programs that run between DIGITAL and 
IBM systems.  

The DECnet/SNA product set provides a system connecting DECnet and
SNA networks which can be used by a wide variety of DIGITAL supplied 
access routines running under VMS, MS-DOS, and ULTRIX operating environments. 
DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST is managed and configured using the DECnet/SNA VMS 
Gateway Management V2.0 product. For additional information on 
the various access routines and their capabilities, consult the 
OPTIONAL SOFTWARE section in the System Support Addendum.
                                                  
DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST works in conjunction with either of the DEC MicroServer 
hardware platforms.  The DEC MicroServer (DEMSA-S*) provides connectivity for 
up to four synchronous lines and the DEC MicroServer-SP (DEMSB-S*) provides a 
single synchronous line connection.  For purposes of this document, the term 
"DEC MicroServer" is used to refer to either hardware device, unless 
specifically stated otherwise.  

DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST is part of both the DECnet and the SNA networks.  
Architecturally, it is a DECnet Phase IV end node to DECnet and a Physical 
Unit Type 2.0 to SNA. Its purpose is to provide bi-directional network 
access between DECnet and SNA networks.  The DEC MicroServer provides 
physical connectivity to an Ethernet Local Area Network and when used in
conjunction with DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST software, it provides SNA connectivity 
to any Phase IV (or Phase IV+) DECnet system in the DECnet network.

This product can be used in networks currently using other DECnet/SNA Gateway 
systems and can share access routines, Ethernet LANs, and load host resources 
with those systems.

The DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST software is down-line loaded into the 
DEC MicroServer.  DECnet/SNA VMS Gateway Management software is also 
required for the VMS node in the Ethernet Local Area Network designated as
the load host for DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST. Other DECnet systems wishing access 
to the SNA network through the DEC MicroServer should be configured with the 
appropriate DECnet/SNA access routines. 

DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST V1.1 supports SNA synchronous communications using the 
SDLC protocol. The number of links supported depends on the hardware unit 
being used (DEC MicroServer or DEC MicroServer-SP), line speeds
required by the customer, and the electrical interface used. Table 1 shows 
the configuration matrix for connecting to the SNA network:

Lines connected to the DEC MicroServer or DEC MicroServer-SP should 
be configured according to guidelines specified in the DECnet/SNA 
Gateway-ST user documentation. 

Loading DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST Software

The DEC MicroServer requires software to be loaded into memory prior to 
DECnet/SNA Gateway operation. DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST software is down-line 
loaded across the Ethernet Local Area Network from a VMS system acting as 
DECnet load host system.

Most VAX, MicroVAX, and VAXstation systems running VMS are
supported as Ethernet load hosts for DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST. Supported
VMS load host configurations are described in the System Support Addendum.

DECnet/SNA VMS Gateway Management 

DECnet/SNA VMS Gateway Management software is required on the VMS load 
host used to support the DECnet/SNA Gateway. It must also be present on 
any other VAX node whose users want to manage DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST and 
the DEC MicroServer. It is strongly recommended that the software also be 
installed on VMS systems where IBM Interconnect application programs are 
developed using DECnet/SNA VMS Programming Interface products in order to 
facilitate application debugging functions.
 
Management of DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST should be viewed as part of the DIGITAL
environment while the management of the synchronous circuits connecting the 
DECnet/SNA Gateway to the IBM network is a joint responsibility of the IBM and
DIGITAL system managers. (Refer to the Customer Responsibilities section 
of this Software Product Description.) 

Product Features

^  NRZI support - Signaling mode for the line(s)
   from the Gateway to the IBM system can be set to  
   NORMAL or NRZI (non-return-to-zero-inverted) so that line  
   characteristics match those set in the IBM ACF/NCP LINE macro.

^  Support for FULL duplex transmission - Circuits can be set 
   FULL duplex to allow data to be sent and  received  
   simultaneously on full duplex lines.  This setting 
   corresponds to DATMODE=FULL in the IBM ACF/NCP PU macro.

^  Support for RECFMS - The Gateway can send  Record  Formatted
   Maintenance Statistics (RECFMS) messages to the IBM system.
   These messages contain counters requested by the IBM Network
   Problem Determination Application (NPDA) using Request
   Maintenance Statistics (REQMS) messages.  Not all RECFMS
   messages are supported by the Gateway, refer to the DECnet/SNA
   VMS Gateway Management user documentation for more information.

^  A simplified configuration procedure - After installing
   Gateway-ST and Gateway Management software, a single configuration 
   procedure is run which creates command procedures that define items 
   for the DECnet database on the load host, and the SNA and DECnet databases 
   on the Gateway.

^  Extended SDLC - Support for Extended Response Mode SDLC (Modulo 128)

When Using DEC MicroServer Hardware

^  Synchronous Line support - DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST supports up to
   four SDLC connections at speeds of 64Kbs/circuit or less, two 
   connections at 128Kbs/circuit or a single connection at 256Kbs.     

^  Session support - DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST supports up to 128
   concurrent (Logical Unit) sessions for selected access routines.

When Using DEC MicroServer-SP Hardware

^  Synchronous Line support - DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST supports one 
   SDLC connection at up to 19.2Kbps

^  Session support - DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST supports up to 16
   concurrent (Logical Unit) sessions for selected access routines.
