DESCRIPTION

The CDA(tm) Converter Library allows users of document and table data files to
convert to and from a variety of other standard document and table file
formats.  The CDA Converter Library adds a broader set of supported formats to
the file conversion facility that is a part of VMS V5.1 with VMS
DECwindows.  The CDA Converter Library for VMS supports both DECwindows
workstations and timesharing systems.  The user interface provided by DCL and
by DECwindows application programs such as DECwrite or DECdecision remains the
same, except that more formats are available.

The supported formats are:

	- Document Converters (each of these is bi-directional)
		- AFS   Alternate Format Syntax - for use with ASCII Editors
		- DCA   IBM PC Word Processing Std., text and graphics
		- DX    DEC WPS-PLUS and word processors
		- SGML  ISO Standard markup language

	- Table Data Converters
		- DTIF(tm) CDA Digital Table Interchange Format, 
                  bi-directional
		- WK1  Lotus(tm) 1-2-3(tm) V2, bi-directional            
		- DIF  Industry Std. Data Interchange Format, read-only
		- CALCGRD  DECalc V3.0A Binary Grid files, read-only
		- ASCII Tabular  Generic ASCII tabular files, bi-directional

	- Domain Converter (read-only)
		- CDA Table format (DTIF(tm)) to CDA Document format 
                  (DDIF(tm))

	- Graphics converters:
		- CGM  ANSI Computer Graphics Metafile, read-only
		- TIFF Tagged Image File Format, bi-directional
		- MacPaint  MacPaint Macintosh bitmap bi-directional
		- DDIF Graphics Hardcopy converter, write-only (3 formats)
		(Requires optional DEC GKS V4.0, see Optional Software, below)
			- HPGL(tm)  Hewlett-Packard plotter format            
			- Monochrome Sixel
			- Color Sixel

Restrictions

The converters in the CDA Converter Library do not perform modality conversions
such as converting a text file into an image or the reverse.  Converters that
support compound formats, such as DDIF, do process the text, graphics and images
in the input data, but the output format specified by the user limits the
conversion process.  If the user takes a DDIF document and converts it to ASCII
text, any non-text elements will be lost because they cannot be represented in
the ASCII format.   For cases where it is desirable to edit a compound document
using an ASCII editor, the bi-directional AFS format converter may be used. 
The text file produced by the AFS converter contains tag references to
temporary files where the non-text data is stored until the document is
re-converted to a compound format.
