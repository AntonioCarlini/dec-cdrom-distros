PRODUCT NAME: VAX TEAMDATA/NORSK, Version 1.3	 SPD 29.11.01

DESCRIPTION

VAX TEAMDATA is an end-user information management product that runs on
the VMS and MicroVMS Operating Systems.  TEAMDATA commands, menu prompts,
Help and error messages are provided in Norwegian.

TEAMDATA provides powerful, yet easy-to-use, information management
capabilities to those who need to use data in their work, but who don't want
to do ``data processing''. TEAMDATA lets users easily store and modify data,
using a screen-oriented, text-editing style, in a powerful relational database
management system (VAX Rdb/VMS). 

TEAMDATA helps users share data, stored locally and remotely, in a
variety of storage formats.  TEAMDATA users can access data stored in
Rdb/VMS databases by TEAMDATA or by other Rdb/VMS applications.  Through
optional use of VAX DATATRIEVE, TEAMDATA allows (read-only) access to
data stored in VAX DBMS databases or RMS files which have been defined
as DATATRIEVE domains. Through optional use of VIDA, TEAMDATA permits        
(read-only) access to data in certain remote IBM mainframe databases.      
Additionally, through  optional use of VAX Xway, users can import and      
export data to and from common spreadsheet and data interchange formats.
Support is provided for 8 bit MCS characters.

TEAMDATA allows users to manipulate their personal data, as well as shared or
remote databases, in simple tables, spreadsheets, reports, and business    
graphs, and to perform complex query and data reduction operations. TEAMDATA 
users can perform their tasks by selecting items from strip menus, using a 
command language, or a combination of the two.

TEAMDATA can be used with ALL-IN-1, as an information management option
on an ALL-IN-1 menu, or can be installed outside of ALL-IN-1. In 
addition, TEAMDATA provides the capability to run applications developed    
using VAX RALLY.  TEAMDATA offers a package of tightly integrated functions 
described below.

Features

Tables (Database)

TEAMDATA users can create and maintain data in tables (stored in Rdb/VMS)    
for private or shared use. Using a text processing style that is similar
to WPS-PLUS function keys, users can ``edit'' screens of data without having 
to learn a complex data manipulation language. Data can be stored, sorted, 
updated, queried and reported on using menu selections, commands, or a 
combination of the two.  Table features include:

^ Ability to display data in tabular form on the screen

^ Ability to create tables and determine display format for new data
	
^ Editing of data, including easy data entry, update and deletion in
  word processing style

^ Query, extract and report by menu-driven record selection

^ Transparent fetching of data from local and remote TEAMDATA 
  or other Rdb/VMS databases, VAX DBMS databases or RMS files 
  through VAX DATATRIEVE (read-only), or remote IBM mainframe 
  databases that are accessible through VIDA (read-only)      

^ Simple report generation using data from single or multiple data 
  sources; ability to subset and sort data, establish line and page
  control breaks, and save/print the results                       

^ Joins between tables, with the ability to store the results in a 
  new table

^ Sorting of data by one or more fields, according to a Norwegian
  language specific collating sequence.  An exception to this is
  sorting of table and sheet names which are sorted according to
  ASCII collating sequences.

^ Aggregate calculations, including TOTAL, COUNT, AVERAGE, MAX, MIN 
  on a whole table or by sub-groups                                

^ Computed fields, where a field is calculated in terms of one or more
  other fields in the same row

Spreadsheets

TEAMDATA provides a basic spreadsheet capability for use in conjunction      
with tables for ad hoc calculations.  TEAMDATA uses compatible menus and    
screen-editing styles for the creation and modification of both spreadsheets
and tables.  Spreadsheet features include:

^ Screen editing of spreadsheet data and formulas

^ Size of spreadsheet: up to 256 columns x 65,000 rows

^ Temporary or permanent creation of new cells/rows/columns after 
  initial spreadsheet creation

^ Automatic recalculation of formulas                                
 
^ Column widths and cell/row/column formats individually adjustable

^ Insert, replicate (copy), move, and delete rows and columns

^ Financial functions such as present value, future value, net 
  present value, depreciated value

^ Mathematical functions such as LOGN, SQRT, ABS, FACTORIAL

^ Statistical functions such as sum, average, minimum, maximum, 
  variance, standard deviation, and count 
	
^ Ability to print spreadsheet formulas or data values

^ Conditional expressions (IF/THEN), with nesting and Boolean 
  comparisons

^ ERROR capability: IF cell x ``error'' THEN substitute cell Y 
  (or value Y) ELSE cell (or value) Z.

Business Graphics

Users can create bar, multi-bar, stacked bar, line, multi-line, pie or scatter
graphs of data from within tables or spreadsheets. Graphs can be displayed,
printed, or saved. Graphs can also be saved and then loaded into VAX       
DECgraph for modification.                                                 

Folders (Directory)

Users can organize tables, spreadsheets, and applications in 
folders.  Folders can be nested hierarchically.

Folders contain a directory of the user's own private information or can
include public information for team or work group use.                     

Integration with ALL-IN-1

TEAMDATA provides integration with ALL-IN-1 in the following areas:          

^ Function keys similar to ALL-IN-1 and WPS-PLUS
 
^ Support of ALL-IN-1 interrupt facilities                            
 
^ Ability to paste TEAMDATA reports and graphs (as text) into      
  ALL-IN-1 documents or electronic mail messages (via the ALL-IN-1 
  scratch pad)

TEAMDATA can be run from an ALL-IN-1 menu, but need not be.

VAX RALLY Applications

TEAMDATA users can run VAX RALLY-generated applications. Application 
developers can create custom applications that include forms, reports, 
menus, HELP and complex logic. These applications can then be included 
on a TEAMDATA directory and run by the end-user. Refer to VAX RALLY 
(SPD 27.03.xx) for more information.  VAX Rally Run-Time system is required 
in order to run VAX Rally applications from TEAMDATA.

Ease-of-use Features

^ Comprehensive, context-sensitive on-line HELP

^ Integrated on-line training lets users learn key concepts and 
  functions while actually working with the TEAMDATA software

^ Ability to save sequences of commands and keystrokes in named     
  procedures, modifiable by DIGITAL text editor of choice, to       
  automate repetitive tasks

^ Ability to modify user defaults 

^ Ability to have multiple active tasks (e.g., tables,              
  spreadsheets, RALLY applications) and to toggle between them.     

Access to Existing Data and Applications 

TEAMDATA allows users to access data in a variety of locations: in tables and
spreadsheets that other TEAMDATA users have created, in Rdb/VMS databases, in 
either VAX DBMS databases or RMS files that have been defined               
as VAX DATATRIEVE domains (read-only), and in IBM mainframe databases that  
are accessible through VIDA (read-only).  Refer to VIDA with IDMS/R (tm),
(SPD 27.25.xx) for further information.

Users can also issue DCL commands and run programs or DCL command procedures 
from within TEAMDATA.                                                        

As an additional option, TEAMDATA provides an interface to the VAX Xway 
format conversion utility allowing for import and export of data and
to and from common spreadsheet and data interchange formats, such as DIF,       
SYLK, WKS, DECalc storage dump.  Refer to VAX Xway (SPD 27.36.xx) for 
further information.  Transfer of formulas is not supported by TEAMDATA.

Other System-wide Features
