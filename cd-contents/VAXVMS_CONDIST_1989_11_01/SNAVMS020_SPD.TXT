PRODUCT NAME: VMS/SNA, Version 2.0                            SPD 27.01.05

DESCRIPTION

VMS/SNA is a layered software product that allows suitably configured VMS
systems the ability to directly participate in an IBM Systems Network
Architecture (SNA) networking environment. After installing the VMS/SNA
software and one or more DECnet/SNA Access Routines, users can perform
functions such as accessing IBM (r) application programs or other system
resources, act as a 3270 display station, exchange data files and documents
with an IBM Host, and implement distributed application programs that run
between the VMS and IBM systems. 

Architecturally, a VAX system running VMS/SNA appears to the SNA network as
a Physical Unit Type 2 node, and is attached to the SNA network through a
synchronous communications device to an IBM 37xx Communications Controller.
The VMS/SNA software supports one synchronous communication line at speeds
from 1.2K bps to 64K bps, depending on the communications device being used
and a maximum of 16-64 concurrent SNA logical unit sessions depending on
the VAX CPU it is running on. Both local and remote connections are
supported from VMS/SNA into the IBM SNA network, using switched or leased
lines in point-to-point or multi-point environments. VMS/SNA also supports
connections over X.25 switched virtual circuits using Qualified Logical
Link Control (QLLC).  VAX Packetnet System Interface (VAX P.S.I.) or VAX
P.S.I. Access is required for SNA over X.25 connections. 

VMS/SNA can send Record Formatted Maintenance Statistics (RECFMS) messages
to the IBM system.  These messages contain counters requested by the IBM
Netview(r) Hardware Monitor using Request Maintenance
Statistics (REQMS) messages.   Not all RECFMS messages are supported by
VMS/SNA. Refer to the VMS/SNA user documentation for more information. 

Devices supported with VMS/SNA include the DST32, DSH32, DPV11, DSV11, 
DMB32, and DSB32.  All VAX P.S.I. supported devices for VAXBI and Q-bus 
based systems are supported when communicating with X.25 networks using 
QLLC circuits.  This excludes all UNIBUS devices, but does include the 
KMV1A.  See the VAX P.S.I. Software Product Description (25.40.xx) or VAX 
P.S.I. Access Software Product Description (27.78.xx) for more 
information.

Each device supports different configurations. Refer to the following
table for details of each supported device.

DSH32     MV2000     Yes        Yes      No      19.2 Kbps

* NRZI support means that the signaling mode for the lines from VMS/SNA to
the IBM system can be set to NORMAL or NRZI (non-return-to-zero-inverted)
so that the line characteristics can match those set in the IBM ACF/NCP
LINE macro. 

Circuits can be set FULL duplex. Data can be sent and  received 
simultaneously on full duplex lines.  This setting corresponds to
DATMODE=FULL in the  IBM  ACF/NCP  PU macro. 

VMS/SNA will support the following session maximums:

MicroVAX 2000, MicroVAX II, VAXstation 3200/3500       16 sessions
MicroVAX 3300, 3400, 3500, 3600                        32 sessions 
VAXserver 3300, 3400, 3500, 3600, 3602                 32 sessions
VAXserver 6210, 6220, 6310, 6320                       32 sessions
VAX 8250, 8350, 6210                                   32 sessions
VAX 6220, 6230, 8550, 8810 (8700)                      48 sessions
VAX 6310, 6320, 6330                                   48 sessions
VAX 6240, 6340, 6350, 6360,                            64 sessions
VAX 8820 (8800), 8830, 8840                            64 sessions

You may configure your IBM line such that you activate more LUs than the
maximum number of sessions allowed for your processor. The maximum number
of active LUs is twice the number of maximum sessions. For example, 64 LUs 
may be activated on a MicroVAX 3600. 

Whether the connection is via X.25 or SDLC, the functions provided by the 
VMS/SNA software will be comparable to those provided by the DECnet/SNA
Gateway product. Systems wishing access to the SNA environment must be
configured with the appropriate DECnet/SNA VMS Access Routines. For
additional information on which Access Routines are supported with VMS/SNA,
consult the table in the Optional Software section of this SPD. 

VMS/SNA supports connections over X.25 switched virtual circuits (QLLC) as
well as SDLC circuits.  The QLLC circuit can be configured to use either 
Incoming or Outgoing X.25 Switched Vitual Ciruits (SVCs).  VMS/SNA does not 
support X.25 Permanent Virtual Ciruits (PVCs). VMS/SNA requires IBM Network 
Packet Switched Interface (NPSI) in order to use QLLC circuits.  The IBM 
NPSI software should be generated to support "Boundary Network Node, 
Qualified Logical Link Control" (BNN QLLC) type-3 switched virtual circuits. 
VMS/SNA also supports the following optional facilities for QLLC circuits:

^ Flow Control Negotiation
^ Closed User Groups
^ Reverse Charging

VMS/SNA Management Utilities

VMS/SNA provides the management utilities SNANCP and SNAEVL. SNANCP is used
to manage and monitor VMS/SNA components such as line, circuit, PU, and LU.
SNANCP provides the human interface for the DIGITAL System Manager to
monitor, control, and troubleshoot VMS/SNA and its IBM/SNA environment. All
management functions pertaining to VMS/SNA are performed on the VAX. The
SNANCP commands allow you to display and modify information pertaining to
the line, circuit, PU, LUs, and access names. On-line help is provided.
SNAEVL is used to log events generated by these components. 

Management of the VMS/SNA node should be viewed as part of the DIGITAL
environment while the management of the line connecting the VMS system
to the IBM system is a joint responsibility of the IBM and DIGITAL system
managers. 

VMS/SNA Problem Isolation and Determination Tools

SNA Protocol Trace Utility (SNATRACE) and a new tool, NETTRACE, are problem
determination tools that provide frame level tracing of a circuit to help
in debugging application programs, as well as identifying system problems.
A privileged user can run a trace at the Physical Unit (PU) level, SDLC
level, or session level.  The trace feature is helpful in identifying an
error for remedial action. NETTRACE can also be used to trace QLLC circuits.

The VMS/SNA Installation Verification Procedure (IVP), SNAVMS$IVP, is also
useful for problem isolation.  SNAVMS$IVP is run separately from any Access
Routine, and may be used to verify connectivity to specific IBM applications
over specific LU sessions.  In failure cases, SNAVMS$IVP displays an
expanded error text that attempts to diagnose the cause of failure. 

INSTALLATION

Purchase of the VMS/SNA Installation/Orientation Service is REQUIRED in
conjunction with the customer's purchase of VMS/SNA software for the first
