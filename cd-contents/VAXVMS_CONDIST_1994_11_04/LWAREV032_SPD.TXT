 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC OSDS-Optical Storage Desktop Software        SPD
 47.45.02                for OpenVMS, Version 3.2

 DESCRIPTION

 The DEC Optical Storage Desktop Software for OpenVMS (DEC OSDS) prod-
 uct provides OpenVMS applications and users the functionality neces-
 sary to access multifunction and Write Once Read Many (WORM) standalone
 (e.g., desktop) optical drives using the conventional device, file,
 and record access services provided by the OpenVMS Operating System.
 In most cases no changes will be required to existing applications that
 use magnetic disk storage.

 The OpenVMS VAX version of DEC OSDS provides local access to rewritable,
 WORM and multifunction drives. The OpenVMS AXP version of DEC OSDS pro-
 vides access to RWZ52 drives using rewritable media only at this time.

 Pseudo-Device Representation

 DEC OSDS allows the OpenVMS host to view the platter inserted into the
 optical disk as a virtual disk device. For single-headed drives, this
 translates to one virtual disk device for each optical disk surface.
 The optical drive, therefore, appears to applications as a virtual disk
 device, or a pseudo-device. Excluding those functions that are unique
 to the optical technology, the pseudo-device emulates the operation
 of a conventional OpenVMS magnetic disk.

 Volume Access

 Volumes in an optical disk drive used with DEC OSDS are accessed us-
 ing the same techniques that are used to access conventional OpenVMS
 disks. The standard OpenVMS INITIALIZE command is used to prepare each
 side of an optical disk cartridge for use and the standard OpenVMS MOUNT
 command is used to make the volume known to OpenVMS. WORM (Write Once)

                               DIGITAL                     June 1994

 volumes can only be "initialized" once, whereas rewritable volumes,
 like magnetic disks, can be "initialized" multiple times.

 File Access

 Files on devices under control of DEC OSDS are accessed using the same
 techniques that are used to access conventional OpenVMS files. Once
 a volume has been mounted, files may be opened, read, written, and closed
 using the conventional OpenVMS system services and run-time library
 functions. Write Once (WORM) volumes use the WORMS-11[R] file system.
 Rewritable volumes use the FILES-11 file system.

 DEC OSDS provides essentially transparent access using standard Open-
 VMS commands and I/O statements from application programs. DEC OSDS
 supports all OpenVMS commands and their library routine equivalents,
 such as, but not limited to:

    INITIALIZE *
    MOUNT
    DISMOUNT
    ALLOCATE
    DEALLOCATE
    CREATE
    CREATE/DIRECTORY
    DIRECTORY
    COPY
    EDIT
    OPEN
    READ
    CLOSE
    DIFFERENCE
    RENAME
    PURGE **
    DELETE **
    BACKUP
    WRITE




                                  2

 

    APPEND

 *  This command can only be used once with WORM media.

 ** These commands can be used with WORM media but will not free up ad-
    ditional disk space as with rewritable media.

 SUPPORTED HARDWARE

 Following are the specific SCSI adapters and the optical drives sup-
 ported by DEC OSDS Version 3.2.

 Other Hardware Required - Connectivity/Adapters:

 o  SCSI Interface: A SCSI interface (direct or via a supported adapter)
    is required for use of any of the supported drives. The following
    list are the only adapters supported for use with this product.

       Q-bus Interface: Digital's KZQSA Q-bus-to-SCSI adapter board is
       required for DEC OSDS to manage optical drives on Q-bus proces-
       sors.
       EISA-based SCSI Controller: The DEC 2000 Model 300 AXP system
       requires Digital's PB2HA-SA optional SCSI controller for DEC OSDS
       to manage more than two direct-connected optical SCSI devices
       on this system.

                                  6

 

       XMI-bus Adapter: Digital's KZMSA XMI-to-SCSI adapter is required
       for DEC OSDS to manage optical drives on XMI-bus AXP processors.
       Note that only rewritable media is currently supported on AXP
       systems, and that the KZMSA adapter is not supported on VAX pro-
       cessors.

 Other Hardware Required - Supported Optical Drives

 For OpenVMS AXP processors, the DEC Optical Storage Desktop Software
 for OpenVMS supports the following specific 5.25-inch optical drive.
 Rewritable media only is currently supported by DEC OSDS for this drive.

 o  Digital RWZ52 5.25-inch multifunction drive

 For OpenVMS VAX processors, DEC OSDS supports the following specific
 5.25-inch multifunction and 12-inch WORM optical drives. Rewritable
 (5.25-inch) and Write Once (WORM) (5.25-inch and 12-inch) media are
 supported by the software.

 o  Digital RWZ52 5.25-inch multifunction drive

 o  LMSI 4100 12-inch WORM drive

 Disk Space Requirements (1 Block = 512 Bytes)

 Disk space required for    15,000 blocks
 VAX installation:
                            (7.7 MB)
 Disk space required for    3,500 blocks
 VAX use:
                            (1.75 MB)

 Disk space required for    15,000 blocks
 AXP installation:
                            (7.7 MB)
 Disk space required for    3,000 blocks
 AXP use:
                            (1.5 MB)


                                  7

 

 These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
 sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
 system environment, configuration, and software options.

 The minimum memory supported is 16 MB for VAX systems and 32 MB for
 AXP systems. The use of this software in conjunction with increased
 memory capability improves performance. The memory size suggested for
 most typical VAX hardware configurations is at least 32 MB.

 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

 o  OpenVMS VAX Operating System V5.5-2 - V6.1

 o  OpenVMS AXP Operating System V1.5 - V6.1 for AXP systems except the
    DEC 2000/300

 o  OpenVMS AXP Operating System V1.5H1 - V6.1 for the DEC 2000/300 sys-
    tem
