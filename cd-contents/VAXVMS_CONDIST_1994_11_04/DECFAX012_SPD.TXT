 PRODUCT NAME:  DECfax Mail for OpenVMS, Version 1.2    SPD 41.69.02

 DESCRIPTION

 DECfax Mail for OpenVMS is a software product that enables fax mes-
 sages to be sent to and received from the public telephone network via
 a Digital computer and one or more fax devices.

 DECfax Mail allows users of electronic mail systems to address mes-
 sages so that they are directed to DECfax Mail for transmission as fax
 messages on the public telephone network.

 DECfax Mail receives fax messages from the public telephone network
 and directs them to operators who distribute the messages to each ad-
 dressee, either as electronic mail messages or as printed copies.

 Sending Faxes

 Users create and send fax messages from their electronic mail system.
 DECfax Mail receives messages from these systems as follows:

 o  Where VAX Message Router is installed, DECfax Mail functions as a
    MAILbus gateway and receives messages from user agents on the MAILbus.
    In this release, DECfax Mail supports ALL-IN-1, DEC MAILworks, VMS-
    mail via MRGATE, and MAILbus Postmaster. Microsoft[R] Mail, cc:Mail[R],
    and ALL-IN-1 IOS for LANs are supported via MAILbus Postmaster.

                               DIGITAL                 February 1994

                                                         AE-PQC8C-TE

 

 o  Where VAX Message Router is not installed, DECfax Mail receives mes-
    sages directly from the electronic mail system. DECfax Mail sup-
    ports receiving mail directly from ALL-IN-1 and DEC MAILworks.

 DECfax Mail does not change the user interface of these systems, al-
 though fax address templates can be added to assist with addressing.

 DECfax Mail also provides a command line interface so users can send
 fax messages from the DCL level.

 DECfax Mail supports the following document types for sending fax mes-
 sages:

 o  Within DECfax Mail as standard:

    -  Text (including the DEC Multinational Character Set), up to 132
       characters per line

    -  DDIF, Digital Document Interchange Format (color translated to
       monochrome)

    -  PostScript[R]

    -  DTIF, Digital Table Interchange Format

    -  Sixel (DEC STD 070-9 Level 1, excluding color)

    -  DOTS, Data Objects Transport Syntax

 o  When the CDA Converter Library is installed:

    -  WPS-PLUS

    -  DX

    -  TIFF, Tagged Image File Format

    -  Microsoft Word for DOS V4.0, V5.0, V5.5

    -  WordPerfect[TM] V5.0 and V5.1 for OpenVMS and MS-DOS[R]

    -  RTF (Rich Text Format) for Microsoft Word for Windows[TM] V1.1,
       V2.0, and Microsoft Word for Macintosh[R] V4.0

                                  2

 

 DECfax Mail provides instructions on creating a macro to allow users
 of Microsoft Word for Windows to send faxes via DECfax Mail using Team-
 Links Messaging.

 Documents can have multiple attachments, each of which can be of a dif-
 ferent document type.

 A cover page can be included in a fax message. It can be customized
 to include text, images (such as a company logo or letterhead) in ei-
 ther DDIF image or encapsulated PostScript format, and fax informa-
 tion such as date, subject, fax number for replies, sender name, and
 addressee name. If no cover page is required it can be suppressed.

 Cover pages can be system-wide or user-specific. If a user does not
 have a personal cover page, the system default cover page is used.

 From the DECfax Mail command line interface, users can invoke differ-
 ent editors, use distribution lists, include electronic mail addresses
 with fax addresses, and defer the sending of a message to a specified
 time and date. From an electronic mail system, users utilize the fea-
 tures of their electronic mail system, such as deferred send, distri-
 bution lists, and nicknames.

 If a message cannot be sent (for example, the dialed number is busy
 or does not answer), DECfax Mail tries to send the message again. The
 number of retries and the time between retries can be set within DEC-
 fax Mail. (Note that in many countries these values are subject to reg-
 ulatory control.)

 If, after retrying, a message is unable to be sent, DECfax Mail no-
 tifies the user by electronic mail. Users can also be notified when
 messages have been successfully delivered.

 DECfax Mail records details of all telephone connections, whether the
 message was successfully transmitted or failed to transmit. This data
 can be extracted and used for accounting.

 Receiving Faxes

 DECfax Mail directs fax messages received from the public telephone
 network to one or more operators, to a printer, or to both.

 Operators are responsible for viewing fax messages and then printing
 them, forwarding them as electronic mail to each addressee, or delet-
 ing them. DECfax Mail stores received messages in DDIF image format.
 Operators can forward messages in DDIF, PostScript, TIFF, or sixel for-
 mat, or print messages in PostScript, DDIF, or sixel format.

 Operators can be notified when fax messages are received. An opera-
 tor can be authorized to process messages received on all lines, or,
 for security reasons, restricted to process messages received from cer-
 tain lines only. Operators can be restricted to viewing only the first
 page of a received fax message (which is generally the cover page).

 DECfax Mail records how the operators have distributed fax messages,
 to provide an audit trail.

 Managing DECfax Mail

 A command line interface is provided for managing DECfax Mail.

 A DECfax Mail manager can start, configure, or shutdown DECfax Mail,
 or start or stop any of its components. The manager can monitor the
 incoming and outgoing message queues. The manager can also set out-
 going messages to be sent in either fine or normal mode.

 The manager can also maintain the user profile database where users
 are registered. The database contains details such as personal name,
 cover page file name, reply fax number, department code (for account-
 ing), and privilege (user, operator, or manager).

 The manager can also enable or disable user authorization. When en-
 abled, only registered users can send fax messages.

 DECfax Mail records system events and errors for both incoming and out-
 going messages, to provide an audit trail.

 DECfax Mail provides functions for tuning of systems with heavy out-
 going traffic to increase the total system throughput.
