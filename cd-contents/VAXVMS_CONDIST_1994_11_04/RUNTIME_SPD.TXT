 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC C/C++ Run-Time Components           SPD 50.46.00
                Version 6.0 for OpenVMS VAX

 DESCRIPTION

 DEC C/C++  Run-Time  Components  Version  6.0  provides  the run-time
 support  required  for    the    proper   execution  of  Digital  and
 vendor-provided  applications on end-user  systems  that  were  built
 using the DEC C or DEC C++ languages or their associated facilities.

 This product is not required for the proper execution of applications
 which have been built using the VAX C language.

 The kit includes:

 o  The DEC C Run-Time library support in shareable and object library
    form.

    The  DEC  C  Run-Time  Library  that  is available on OpenVMS  VAX
    Version 6.0 is packaged on this kit.  The DEC C  Run-Time  Library
    provides routines to perform  input/output,  character  and string
    handling,  mathematical  computations,  memory  allocation,    and
    emulation of selected UNIX[R] features.  The routines in the DEC C
    Run-Time Library provide an ANSI-C compliant implementation of the
    support.

 o  The VAX C Run-Time Library support in shareable and object library
    form

    The VAX C Run-Time Library that is available  on  OpenVMS VAX V6.0
    is  packaged  on this kit.  The VAX C  Run-Time  Library  provides
    routines to  perform  input/output, character and string handling,
    mathematical computations, memory  allocations,  and  emulation of
    selected UNIX features.   Also  supported  are  the  4.3BSD socket
    routines for interprocess communications across  a  network.   The
    routines in the VAX C Run-Time Library are not ANSI-C compliant.

                                                         AE-Q1QTA-TK

 

 o  The DEC C++ class library support in shareable image form

    The DEC C++ Class Library which  consists  of  the following class
    library    packages:     iostream,  complex,  generic,  Objection,
    Stopwatch, String, task, Messages, and vector.

 o  The user-mode multithreading capability referred to as DECthreads
    in shareable image form

    The DECthreads library which  is  available on OpenVMS VAX Version
    6.0  is  packaged  on  this    kit.       DECthreads  provides  an
    implementation of draft 4 of the  proposed  POSIX 1003.4a standard
    and  is  Digital's  implementation  of  the Distributed  Computing
    Environment  (DCE)  Threads  as  defined  by  the  Open   Software
    Foundation[TM].  DECthreads is a library of run-time routines that
    allows  the user to create multiple threads of execution within  a
    single   address  space.    Multithreading    capability    allows
    computation  activity  to  be  overlapped  with    I/O   activity.
    Synchronization elements, such as mutexes and condition variables,
    are  provided  to help ensure that shared resources  are  accessed
    correctly.   DECthreads also provides multiple scheduling policies
    for scheduling and prioritizing threads.

 o  The  interoperability  tools    provide  the  ability  to  resolve
    conflicts when multiple C Run-Time Libraries are being pulled into
    an image.

    The  tools  VAXC$LCL.OPT, VAXC$EMPTY.EXE, and  DECC$EMPTY.EXE  are
    provided to allow multiple C Run-Time  Libraries  to  be  accessed
    within  one  image.   The VAXC2DECC.EXE and  VAXCG2DECC.EXE  tools
    provide  a  means  of accessing the DEC C  Run-Time  Library  from
    objects generated by the VAX C compiler.
