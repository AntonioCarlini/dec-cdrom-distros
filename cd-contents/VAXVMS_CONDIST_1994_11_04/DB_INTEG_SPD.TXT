 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC DB Integrator Gateway for DBMS,     SPD 51.13.00
                Version 1.0 for OpenVMS VAX

 DESCRIPTION

 DEC DB Integrator Gateway for DBMS for OpenVMS VAX (DBMS Gateway) pro-
 vides applications and tools with direct, read and update[1] access
 to DEC DBMS databases. This access can be via interactive or dynamic
 SQL interfaces. Support for client/server access is provided by the
 SQL/Services facility and the DEC ODBC Driver for MS[R] Windows[TM]
 clients. Optional support for embedded SQL and SQL module language pro-
 gramming is available.

 The DBMS Gateway also provides native integration with DEC DB Inte-
 grator (DBI). DBI extends the functionality of the DBMS Gateway and
 provides DBI Catalog storage of the DBMS metadata and provides the abil-
 ity to do cross-database joins.

 The DBMS Gateway runs under the OpenVMS VAX Operating System on Dig-
 ital VAX, MicroVAX, VAXstation, VAXserver and VAXft systems, servers
 and workstations.

 Features

 SQL Programming Interfaces

 The DBMS Gateway provides direct, read and update[1] access to DBMS
 databases. User applications access data from these databases in the

 ____________________
  The   update access provided by this product allows existing records
   in the DBMS database to be modified.  It does not allow new records

   to be inserted or existing records to be deleted.

                               DIGITAL                    March 1994

 same way as they would access data from a DEC Rdb database. SQL sup-
 port includes Interactive SQL and Dynamic SQL for server-based devel-
 opment and the SQL/Services facility to support client/server imple-
 mentations.

 o  Interactive SQL supports DEC SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML).

 o  The dynamic SQL interface compiles and executes SQL requests passed
    through its call interface. This programming approach is highly ef-
    fective in applications such as ad-hoc query where the exact pa-
    rameters of requests are not known until runtime. It is compati-
    ble with any programming language that supports the OpenVMS call-
    ing standard. The dynamic memory handling capabilities of DEC Ada
    VAX PL/I and VAX C enable these languages to take full advantage
    of the power and flexibility of this approach.

 o  All data format translations for supported OpenVMS datatypes are
    performed automatically as part of handling requests to read and
    update data in DBMS databases.

 Desktop Connectivity

 The SQL/Services Server and Client Application Programming Interface
 (API) enables client applications on MS Windows, MS-DOS[R], OS/2[R],
 Macintosh[R], ULTRIX, or OpenVMS platforms to read and update DBMS databases
 over DECnet, TCP/IP, Novell[R] IPX/SPX or AppleTalk[R] network trans-
 ports.

 Microsoft[R] Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) applications can read
 from, and write to, DBMS databases using the DEC ODBC Driver for MS
 Windows.

 The following table summarizes SQL/Services network support. Clients
 other than the DEC ODBC Driver for MS Windows are based on the SQL/Services
 API.

 Distributed Data Access

 The DBMS Gateway supports access from remote clients and to remote DBMS
 databases.

 Integration with DEC SQL Applications

 The DBMS Gateway makes data residing in DBMS databases accessible to
 Digital Information Management an End-User Access tools.

 o  DEC Data Distributor can maintain extracts and rollups of DBMS ta-
    bles and views.

 o  DATATRIEVE queries and reports can combine data from DBMS Gateways,
    other DBI Gateways and DEC Rdb databases.

 o  DEC RALLY applications can query and report DBMS databases.

 Optional SQL License Support

 Optional DEC SQL Interactive and Development support is provided with
 the purchase of a DBI or Rdb or DEC SQL Interactive or Development Li-
 cense.

                                  3

 

 An optional SQL Interactive License provides DEC SQL Data Definition
 Language (DDL) functionality. The DBMS Gateway supports a subset of
 DEC SQL DDL for creating objects and granting privilege access to them.

 An optional SQL Full Development License provides precompiler support
 for embedded SQL applications and a compiler for SQL module language
 programs.

 Embedded SQL programming places SQL language statements in line with
 host language statements. Precompilers replace these SQL statements
 with call statements and object modules. The modified host language
 program is compiled and linked with the object modules to form an ex-
 ecutable image. Precompilers for VAX C, DEC Ada, DEC COBOL, DEC For-
 tran, DEC Pascal and DEC PL/I are included.

 These precompilers support an optional Federal Information Process-
 ing Standards (FIPS) flagger that allows the user to identify any SQL
 statements which are not in the current ANSI/ISO SQL standard. An ex-
 ception flagger for the Multivendor Integration Architecture (MIA) stan-
 dard is also provided.

 SQL module language allows SQL statements and multistatement proce-
 dures to be grouped into modules. When these modules are compiled, the
 resulting object modules can be linked with objects created by any lan-
 guage compiler that complies with the OpenVMS calling standard. The
 SQL module language compiler also supports FIPS and MIA flagging.

 Performance

 The DBMS Gateway selects access strategies that minimize data trans-
 fer activity. Wherever possible, selection, filtering, and statisti-
 cal operations are done by the DBMS. A log of communications activ-
 ity and errors is maintained to assist in problem isolation and eval-
 uation.

 clude support INSERT and DELETE Statements.
