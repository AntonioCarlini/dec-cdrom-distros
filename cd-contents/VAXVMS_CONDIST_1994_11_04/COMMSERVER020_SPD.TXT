 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC Commserver for OpenVMS, Version 2.0 SPD 33.21.02

 DESCRIPTION

 DEC Commserver for OpenVMS offers application developers the tools nec-
 essary to allow user applications on OpenVMS (host) systems to com-
 municate with suitably configured DEC Commserver hardware (server) sys-
 tems via the Ethernet.

 The DEC Commserver for OpenVMS software package is composed of both
 host and server functional components.

 The components which run on the host include:

 o  An Application Interface Driver that implements the Simpact Asso-
    ciates, Inc. application programming interface (API)

 o  A host transport driver that interfaces to the system's Ethernet
    driver

 o  Configuration and management drivers

 The components within DEC Commserver for OpenVMS which run on the server
 include:

 o  A Commserver transport driver

 o  A transfer application

 o  Management and device processes

 o  The VAXELN Operating System

 o  Communications protocols

 Features

                               DIGITAL                    April 1994

                                                         AE-PEAJC-TE

 

 Transparency

 The DEC Commserver's application interface driver provides an API that
 is similar to that used by Simpact Associates Inc.'s ICP1622 and ICP3222
 I/O driver software.

 This similarity permits customers to use their newly developed (or ex-
 isting) Simpact-based applications as if the Simpact hardware (ICP1622
 or ICP3222) were installed directly in the host, even though the I/O
 interface is actually installed within DEC Commserver hardware unit(s)
 attached to the Ethernet. Application programs are able to perform $QIO
 requests to the DEC Commserver's application interface driver and have
 the calls and replies transported to and from the server.

 Flexibility

 DEC Commserver for OpenVMS can be configured to interface with mul-
 tiple servers and, conversely, servers can be configured to interface
 with multiple hosts. Any combination of host and server connections
 can be made up to a maximum configuration of 31 hosts and/or 31 servers
 on a single local area network (LAN).

 When data transfer security is paramount, a DEC Commserver may be phys-
 ically configured in a single, private connection to one particular
 host Ethernet adapter. This configuration does not allow access from
 any other hosts.

 Users must strictly follow configuration and performance guidelines,
 since the total number of communications lines supported is a func-
 tion of line speeds, line utilization, and protocol processing loads.

 Supportability

 Simpact Associates, Inc. software protocols for the DEC Commserver are
 supported by Digital when purchased with the DEC Commserver for Open-
 VMS software.

 Performance

 DEC Commserver for OpenVMS performance is measured in terms of the per-
 formance of the individual components. In particular, customers must
 be aware of the performance restrictions of the communications devices
 being used.

 Simpact's ICP1622/EXC1612 and ICP3222/EXC3212 modules are capable of
 supporting line speeds up to 64 Kbps, or 1000 Kbps, respectively, de-
 pending on the communications processor type and protocol combination.

 However, the anticipated performance of any individual communications
 line must consider data throughput needs, the protocol(s) used, the
 number of communications lines per DEC Commserver system, and the den-
 sity of traffic on the Ethernet.

 STANDARDS SUPPORTED

 The DEC Commserver for OpenVMS product conforms to industry specifi-
 cations for communications protocols as indicated with the descrip-
 tion of each protocol above.
