 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC C++ Version 1.2 for OpenVMS VAX     SPD 37.39.02

 DESCRIPTION

 DEC C++  for  OpenVMS  VAX  Systems  is a native programming language
 product which supports the C++ programming language.  It includes:

 o  A C++ compiler that implements C++ as defined by The Annotated C++
    Reference  Manual,  Ellis  &    Stroustrup,    as  reprinted  with
    corrections in May 1991.   The  compiler  implementation  includes
    templates  but  excludes  exception handling.   DEC  C++  directly
    generates optimized object code.  No intermediate translation to C
    is employed.

 o  A  DEC  C++ Class Library which consists of  the  following  class
    library  packages:      iostream,   complex,  generic,  Objection,
    Stopwatch, String, task, Messages, and vector.

 o  ANSI/ISO  C  header files  enhanced  for  use  with  the  DEC  C++
    compiler.  These headers are  currently  packaged  with DEC C++ to
    make  them available for use with  DEC  C++.    Packaging  of  the
    headers  is  subject  to  change  as  they   become  available  in
    subsequent releases of related products.

 o  A separately packaged run time kit that can  be  redistributed  to
    allow applications vendors to support end-user systems without DEC
    C++ development licenses of their own.

 The available  documentation  provides  comprehensive  reference  and
 usage information for all product  components.  Included only as part
 of the hardcopy documentation is a  copy  of an authoritative book on
 C++, The C++ Programming Language, 2nd edition, by Bjarne Stroustrup.




                               DIGITAL                  October 1993

                                                         AE-PNA2C-TE

 

 The documentation is provided in both online  and  hardcopy  formats.
 The online documentation consists of Help files included on the media
 kit,   and  Bookreader  documents  included  on  the  OpenVMS  Online
 Documentation CD-ROM.

 Features

 o  Fast compilation  and  increased  code  optimization  by  directly
    translating C++ source programs to OpenVMS VAX object files

 o  Extensive global and  local  optimizations  of  generated code for
    increased performance under OpenVMS

 o  Option for running only the preprocessor phase of compilation

 o  Pragmas to control compiler options

    -  Pragmas  to control extern  models,  sharing  of  data  between
       concurrent processes, and structure member alignment

 o  Separate and combined compilation capabilities

 o  Compiler generated listing file including optional:

    -  Machine code

    -  Macro expansion

    -  Compilation statistics

 o  Data types for numeric, nonnumeric, and systems programming:

    -  8, 16, and 32 bit signed and unsigned integers

    -  Single  and  double-precision  floating point  numbers  in  VAX
       format.    Either  D-float  or  G-float  may    be    used   in
       double-precision format.

 o  Integration into the Program Development Environment:

    -  Generation of complete debug and traceback records for  OpenVMS
       VAX symbolic debugger support

                                  2

 

    -  Conforms to the OpenVMS VAX calling standard

    -  Access  to  the  OpenVMS  Run-time  Library for general purpose
       routines and support of multi-language environments

    -  Access to the data management facilities of OpenVMS RMS (Record
       Management Services)

    -  Ability to package C++ code as shareable libraries

    -  Ability to  use  additional  class  libraries.    The  DEC  C++
       compiler supports logical name search lists in conjunction with
       the preprocessor directive #include.

    -  Support  for  DEC Language-Sensitive Editor  to  provide  error
       diagnostics to the Editor

 Run-time Library Redistribution

 The DEC C++ kit includes a separately packaged saveset which contains
 all the run-time components needed to execute programs developed with
 the DEC C++ compiler and class  libraries  on  supported  OpenVMS VAX
 system    configurations.    Digital  grants  you  a    nonexclusive,
 royalty-free,  worldwide  right  to  reproduce  and  distribute  this
 saveset  portion  of  the DEC C++ kit designated as  AACRT060.A  (the
 "RTL") provided that you:

 o  distribute  the  entire RTL saveset and copies of its accompanying
    documentation;

 o  distribute  the  RTL only in conjunction with and as part of  your
    software application product  which  is designed to operate in the
    OpenVMS VAX environment;

 o  do not use Digital's name,  logo,  or  trademarks  to  market your
    software application product;

 o  include Digital's copyright notice for DEC  C++  on  your  product
