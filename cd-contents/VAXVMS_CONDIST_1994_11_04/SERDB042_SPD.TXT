 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC SERdb for Security-Enhanced VMS[*], SPD 33.46.01
                Version 4.2

 DESCRIPTION

 DEC Security-Enhanced Rdb (SERdb) is a multi-level secure relational
 database system designed for the Security-Enhanced VMS (VMS SES) Op-
 erating System. It is designed to meet the National Computer Security
 Center B1-level of trust and provides a secure database environment
 for organizations that require mandatory access control to process sen-
 sitive database information.

 DEC SERdb is an extension of VAX Rdb/VMS and enhances the security pro-
 vided by VAX Rdb/VMS, to provide a database system design to comply
 with all feature requirements for a Class B1 database management sys-
 tem.

 Using DEC SERdb, data of multiple security classifications such as top
 secret, secret, confidential, or unclassified can be stored in one database.
 Through the appropriate assignment of data labels and user clearances,
 the database administrator can hide the existence of SERdb tables and
 /or data records from unauthorized users.

 Features

 The features and capabilities of VAX Rdb/VMS also apply to DEC SERdb.
 Refer to the VAX Rdb/VMS Software Product Description (SPD 25.59.xx)
 or the VAX Rdb/VMS Documentation Set for more information.

 The following security-relevant features are present in VAX Rdb/VMS
 as well as in DEC SERdb:

 The   terms VMS and OpenVMS refer to the OpenVMS operating system.

 Discretionary Access Control

 o  Rights to perform database operations are kept in a set of Access
    Control Lists (ACLs) associated with databases, tables, views, and
    columns.

 o  ACLs are stored in the database and maintained by the owner of the
    object. ACLs can be updated at any time.

 o  Two styles of ACLs are supported:

       ANSI-standard
       VMS-standard

 o  VMS user identification codes, system identifiers, and general rights
    identifiers can be used to identify users in the Access Control List.

 o  Certain operating system privileges can alter the behavior of the
    discretionary access control mechanism.

 Identification and Authentication

 o  DEC SERdb uses the identification and authentication services of
    the operating system. When users log into the operating system, they
    do not also log into the database system. DEC SERdb allows for a
    single point of user identification and authentication.

 Audit

 The following database security-relevant events are audited:

 o  Modifications to security auditing characteristics

 o  Attempts to access database objects protected by the VAX Rdb/VMS
    discretionary security policy

 o  Changes in ACLs

 o  Use of RMU commands

 Audit records can be written to the operating system security audit
 journal and/or displayed as alarms on a security operator's terminal.

                                  2

 

 Audit events are enabled on a per-database basis so each database can
 be audited differently.

 Modification and display of auditing characteristics are accomplished
 using RMU commands. RMU commands are also used to load audit records
 into a database for further review by any database query tool.

 The features described below are specific to DEC SERdb only.

 Labels

 o  All metadata and data records contain classification labels which
    indicate the secrecy of the record. This label is used to enforce
    the mandatory access control policy. Index records are not labeled.

 o  Supports database-level constraint that all metadata should be at
    the same classification as the database definition.

 o  Supports table-level constraint that all rows in the table should
    be at the same classification as the table definition.

 o  Labels are compatible with VMS SES labels.

 o  Labels are stored in the database using VMS SES binary represen-
    tation and are translated to text upon display to the application.

 o  Labels can be used in queries and in index and constraint defini-
    tions. Labels can be specified when tables are created or altered
    (assuming sufficient privileges).

 Mandatory Access Control

 o  Rights to perform database operations are governed by a mandatory
    security policy based on the security label on the database object
    and the user's clearance.

 o  Policy is enforced for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT opera-
    tions on data records, and for CREATE, ALTER, DROP, and SHOW op-
    erations on metadata records.

 o  Database-level parameter allows the mandatory access control pol-
    icy to be enabled or disabled.

                                  3

 

 o  Certain operating system privileges can alter the behavior of the
    mandatory access control mechanism.

 Polyinstantiation

 o  Polyinstantiation occurs when a user attempts to insert or update
    a record with a PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE value which duplicates that
    of a record at a higher classification. The resulting integrity vi-
    olation is allowed, by default, to preserve the secrecy of the data
    at the higher classification.

 o  Supports database-level parameter that prevents polyinstantiation
    from occurring so data integrity, rather than secrecy, is preserved.

 Audit

 Attempts to access database objects protected by DEC SERdb mandatory
 access security policy are audited.

 Remote Access

 o  Application programs developed to access SERdb databases and run-
    ning under VMS SES on a given node in a DECnet network can:

    -  Access SERdb databases on the same node

    -  Access SERdb databases on other nodes in the network

 o  VAX Rdb/VMS cannot access any database created by SERdb.

 o  SERdb cannot access any database created by VAX Rdb/VMS.

 Limits and Parameters

 o  Maximum number of security levels: 256

 o  Maximum number of security categories (compartments): 128
