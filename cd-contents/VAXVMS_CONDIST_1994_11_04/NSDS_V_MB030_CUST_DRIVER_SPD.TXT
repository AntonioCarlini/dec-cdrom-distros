   PRODUCT NAME:  DEC DB Integrator Gateway for Custom Drivers     SPD
   45.40.03                Version 3.0B for OpenVMS VAX

   DESCRIPTION

   DEC DB Integrator Gateway for Custom Drivers for OpenVMS VAX (Custom
   Drivers Gateway) enables the implementation of gateways that provide
   relational access to non-relational data sources. These gateways pro-
   vide applications and tools with direct read/write access to these data
   sources through the gateway's interactive SQL or dynamic SQL inter-
   faces. Client/server access is supported through the SQL/Services fa-
   cility and a driver for Microsoft[R] Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
   clients. Optional support for embedded SQL and SQL module language pro-
   gramming is available.

   When used in conjunction with DEC DB Integrator (DBI) and other DBI
   gateways, the Custom Drivers Gateway enables the integration of non-
   relational data sources with SYBASE[R] ORACLE[R], IBM[R] DB2[TM], DEC
   Rdb, DEC DBMS and DSM databases as well as OpenVMS RMS files and IBM
   MVS and VM/CMS data sets.

   The Custom Drivers Gateway runs under the OpenVMS VAX operating sys-
   tem on Digital VAX, MicroVAX, VAXstation, VAXserver and VAXft systems,
   servers and workstations.

   Components

   Non-SQL Data Server

   The Non-SQL Data Server is the component that brings data and their
   definitions (metadata) together and makes them appear relational. The
   Non-SQL (Data Server enables applications to access this non-relational

   data in a relational manner. The Non-SQL Data Server plans, optimizes,
   and executes read and write operations.

   Custom Driver Interfaces

   The Custom Drivers Gateway provides two published interfaces, which
   developers may use to write data, and metadata drivers which can work
   with the Non-SQL Data Server to provide customized SQL access to their
   data source.

   A Driver Development Guide as well as source code for sample data and
   metadata drivers are provided for instructional purposes. Some SQL fea-
   tures require specific capabilities in the source data management sys-
   tem.

   Features

   Relational Access to Non-Relational Data
   The Custom Drivers Gateway allows applications to read and write to
   non-relational data sources using standard SQL syntax and programming
   interfaces.

   Standard DEC SQL Programming Interfaces

   The Custom Drivers Gateway includes DEC SQL interactive and dynamic
   SQL interfaces. The included SQL/Services facility supports the client
   /server implementation style.

   o  The interactive SQL interface provides SQL data manipulation lan-
      guage (DML) support for insert, select, update, delete, join, project
      and order operations.

   o  The dynamic SQL interface compiles and executes SQL requests passed
      through its call interface. This programming approach is highly ef-
      fective in applications such as ad-hoc query where the exact pa-
      rameters of requests are not known until runtime. It is compati-
      ble with any programming language that supports the OpenVMS call-
      ing standard. The dynamic memory handling capabilities of Ada, PL/I
      and C enable these languages to take full advantage of the power
      and flexibility of this approach.

   DEC DB Integrator Gateway for Custom Drivers          SPD 45.40.03
   Version 3.0B for OpenVMS VAX

   o  The Custom Drivers Gateway performs data format translations for
      supported VMS datatypes as part of processing requests to read or
      update data.

   Desktop Connectivity

   Microsoft Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) applications can read from,
   and write to, Custom Drivers Gateway data sources using the DEC ODBC
   Driver for MS[R] Windows. This driver provides access to SQL/Services
   servers over DECnet or TCP/IP network transports. This driver also pro-
   vides these applications with access to DEC Rdb databases, DBI and the
   other DBI gateways.

   Distributed Data Access

   The Custom Drivers Gateway supports access from remote clients and to
   remote Custom Driver databases.

   Integration with DEC SQL Applications

   The Custom Drivers Gateway makes data residing in Custom Drivers data sources
   accessible to Digital information management and end-user access tools.

   o  DEC Data Distributor can maintain extracts and rollups of Custom
      Drivers Gateway tables and views.

   o  DATATRIEVE queries, reports, and updates can combine data from Cus-
      tom Drivers Gateways, other DBI gateways and DEC Rdb databases.

   o  DEC RALLY applications can query and report data accessible through
      Custom Drivers gateways.

   Optional SQL Support

   Support for SQL application development is available with the optional
   purchase of development licenses for DEC SQL, DEC DB Integrator or DEC
   Rdb. These development licenses provide precompiler support for em-
   bedded SQL applications, a compiler for SQL module language programs
   and an application programming interface (API) to support the devel-
   opment of client/server applications.

   DEC DB Integrator Gateway for Custom Drivers          SPD 45.40.03
   Version 3.0B for OpenVMS VAX

   Embedded SQL programming places SQL language statements in line with
   host language statements. Precompilers replace these SQL statements
   with call statements and object modules. The modified host language
   program is compiled and linked with the object modules to form an ex-
   ecutable image. Precompilers for DEC C, DEC Ada, DEC COBOL, DEC For-
   tran, DEC Pascal and PL/I for OpenVMS are included.

   These precompilers support an optional Federal Information Process-
   ing Standards (FIPS) flagger that allows the user to identify any SQL
   statements which are not in the current ANSI/ISO SQL standard. An ex-
   ception flagger for the Multivendor Integration Architecture (MIA) stan-
   dard is also provided.

   The SQL module language processor allows SQL statements and multistate-
   ment procedures to be grouped into modules. When these modules are com-
   piled, the resulting object modules can be linked with objects cre-
   ated by any language compiler that complies with the OpenVMS calling
   standard. The SQL module language compiler also supports FIPS and MIA
   flagging.

   SQL/Services API programming libraries are used to interface client
   applications to the SQL/Services server. MS-DOS[R] or MS Windows client
   applications can be written in Microsoft C. Macintosh[R] client ap-
   plications can be written in MPW[TM] C or ThinkC.

   A development license also includes SQL/Services client programming
   libraries for Microsoft Windows[TM], MS-DOS, Sun[R], ULTRIX or Open-
   VMS platforms.

   The following table summarizes SQL/Services network support. Clients
   other than the DEC ODBC Driver for MS Windows are based on the SQL/Services
   API.

   be reduced by approximately that (14 MB) amount.

   These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
   sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
   system environment, configuration, and software options selected.

   Additional space must be allowed for programs, logs, and temporary database
   cache files, and user interface software.
