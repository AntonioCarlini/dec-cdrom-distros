 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC SNA Domain Gateway, Version 1.1     SPD 38.69.01

 DESCRIPTION

 The DEC SNA Domain Gateway (Domain Gateway) is a member of Digital's
 family of DEC SNA network transport products. This family consists of
 hardware and software products that connect suitably configured sys-
 tems in a Digital DECnet environment with suitably configured IBM[R]
 systems in a Systems Network Architecture (SNA) environment. With ap-
 propriate OpenVMS, ULTRIX, DEC OSF/1[R], Windows[TM], and MS-DOS[R]
 access routines, users can exchange information and share resources
 between Digital and IBM networked systems in a bidirectional manner.

 The Domain Gateway is managed and configured using the management soft-
 ware that is part of the Domain Gateway product.

 The Domain Gateway is part of both the DECnet network and the SNA net-
 work. Architecturally, it is a DECnet/OSI end node and an SNA Phys-
 ical Unit Type 5 (PU T5) node. The Domain Gateway appears to the SNA
 network as an SNA Domain that contains one subarea.

 The DEC SNA Domain Gateway software is supported on two DEC ChannelServer
 hardware platforms (the DEC ChannelServer II [DESNB-Ax] and the DEC
 ChannelServer [DESNA-Ax]) and two DEC MicroServer hardware platforms
 (the DEC MicroServer [DEMSA-Ax] and the DEC MicroServer-SP [DEMSB-Ax]).
 When used with the Domain Gateway software, each of these hardware prod-
 ucts provides SNA connectivity to any DECnet/OSI or DECnet Phase IV
 system in the DECnet network.

 Both DEC ChannelServer hardware units connect directly to an Ether-
 net local area network (LAN) using a standard Ethernet transceiver ca-
 ble, and to an IBM S/370 Block Multiplexer channel using a single set

                               DIGITAL                September 1993

 of Bus and Tag connectors. The combination of the Domain Gateway soft-
 ware and one of the ChannelServer hardware units is referred to as a
 Domain Gateway-CT.

 Both DEC MicroServer hardware units connect directly to an Ethernet
 LAN using a standard Ethernet transceiver cable. The DEC MicroServer
 hardware unit connects to up to four front-end communications controllers
 (37xx-style) using standard synchronous data lines and modems. These
 front-end processors must all be in the same SNA network. The DEC MicroServer-
 SP hardware unit connects to a single front-end communications con-
 troller (37xx-style) using a standard synchronous data line and mo-
 dem. The combination of the Domain Gateway software and one of the Mi-
 croServer hardware units is referred to as a Domain Gateway-ST.

 This product can be used in networks currently using other DEC SNA Gate-
 way systems and can share access routines, Ethernet LANs, and load host
 resources with those systems.

 The Domain Gateway supports a single PU with its own System Services
 Control Point (SSCP). The Gateway supports up to 16 explicit routes
 for each destination subarea in the SNA network, supports IBM Class
 of Service capability, and allows up to 8 virtual routes (each of which
 can have 3 transmission priority levels) for each explicit route. The
 Domain Gateway-CT and the Domain Gateway-ST running on the DEC MicroServer-
 SP (DEMSB-Ax) hardware platform support a single Transmission Group
 (TG). The Domain Gateway running on the DEC MicroServer (DEMSA-Ax) hard-
 ware platform supports multiple (up to 4) TGs and multilink TGs.

 The Domain Gateway-CT supports the configuration of up to 1024 Log-
 ical Units (LUs) and the Domain Gateway-ST supports up to 128 LUs. All
 LUs can have multiple sessions. Table 1 shows the maximum number of
 active LU-LU sessions supported by the four hardware platforms.

 Because the Domain Gateway is a PU T5 implementation, it enables DEC-
 net/OSI-based applications to be either Primary Logical Units (PLUs)
 or Secondary Logical Units (SLUs) when communicating with IBM appli-
 cations and peripheral devices. This means that suitably configured
 Digital-based applications can be interactively accessed from IBM SNA
 networked 3270 devices and PCs.

 Features Common to all Domain Gateways

 o  Implements an SNA PU T5

 o  Multiple session support for each LU

 o  Supports applications acting as either PLUs or SLUs

 o  Provides access to OpenVMS applications from SNA 3270 devices and
    PCs

 o  Implements IBM Class of Service support

 o  Supports SNA Explicit Routes, Virtual Routes, and Transmission Pri-
    ority Levels

 o  Supports a wide variety of access routines

 Loading DEC SNA Gateway Software

 The Domain Gateway software is downline loaded into one of the DEC Chan-
 nelServer or DEC MicroServer products over the Ethernet LAN from an
 OpenVMS VAX system acting as a DECnet load host system. Most OpenVMS-
 based VAX, MicroVAX, VAXserver, or VAXstation systems can be used as
 Domain Gateway load hosts. The System Support Addendum (SSA 38.69.01-
 x) describes valid configurations.

 Other DECnet systems requiring access to the SNA environment through
 the Domain Gateway, should be configured with the appropriate DECnet
 SNA access routines.

 When loaded on one of the two DEC ChannelServer hardware units, the
 Domain Gateway appears to the SNA network as an IBM 3088 Channel-to-
 Channel Adapter (CTCA) and system programmers configure the IBM chan-
 nel address as a 3088 device according to specifications listed in both
 the hardware and software user documentation.

 When loaded on one of the two DEC MicroServer hardware units, the Do-
 main Gateway appears to adjacent front-end processors as another front-
 end processor and appears to IBM hosts in the SNA network as another
 IBM host. IBM system programmers should configure the adjacent front-
 end processors and adjacent IBM hosts according to specifications listed
 in both the hardware and software user documentation.

 Components

 The DEC SNA Domain Gateway software includes two software components:
 the Domain Gateway Load Host software (with its Configuration Util-
 ity), and the Domain Gateway Management software.

 Gateway Load Host Software

 The Domain Gateway load host software includes the system image that
 is down-line loaded to one of the supported hardware units and the Con-
 figuration Utility that provides a convenient method for configuring
 the Domain Gateway.


                                  6

 

 The Configuration Utility allows Gateway managers to save answers and
 to modify discrete parts of the configuration. The Configuration Util-
 ity can also read path definition files created by IBM network def-
 inition utilities and use that information in the Domain Gateway con-
 figuration.

 Because the Domain Gateway supports multiple sessions per LU, the Do-
 main Gateway manager can configure a single LU for those access rou-
 tines which support multiple sessions, thus reducing configuration time.
 Gateway Management Software

 The Domain Gateway Management software includes DECnet-style network
 management tools for configuring, controlling, monitoring, and trou-
 bleshooting the Domain Gateway. The Domain Gateway manager can set up
 or modify parameters relating to routes, physical units, logical units,
 and other key variables necessary for network-to-network communica-
 tions between the DECnet and SNA networks. Additionally, the Domain
 Gateway Management software allows the manager to diagnose and solve
 most problems related to the Domain Gateway.

 Although all management of the Domain Gateway is performed from a Gate-
 way management node in the DECnet network, the management of the Do-
 main Gateway's SNA components is conceptually part of the management
 of the IBM SNA network. Therefore, the management of the routes and
 the data links connecting the Domain Gateway to the IBM network is the
 joint responsibility of the IBM system or network programmer and the
 Domain Gateway manager. (Refer to the Customer Responsibilities sec-
 tion of this Software Product Description.)

 The Domain Gateway Management software includes support for Network
 Control Language (NCL) commands, a monitoring utility (SNAP), and Com-
 mon Trace Facility (CTF) analysis routines. The SNAP utility displays
 the status of the Domain Gateway's buffer availability, the number of
 SNA sessions in progress, and information about the DECnet and SNA net-
 works. The CTF analysis routines help debug application programs and
 assist in identifying system problems by capturing and analyzing multi-
 protocol data. CTF can be used at the Transmission Group, Virtual Route,
 Logical Unit, or session level.


                                  7

 

 The Domain Gateway Management software resides on a Gateway load host
 system or, optionally, on additional nodes called Domain Gateway man-
 agement nodes. Most OpenVMS-based VAX, MicroVAX, VAXserver, and VAXs-
 tation systems can serve as Domain Gateway management nodes. The Sys-
 tem Support Addendum (SSA 38.69.01-x) lists valid configurations.

 Access Routines

 OpenVMS, ULTRIX, DEC OSF/1, Windows, or MS-DOS-based Digital access
 routines can use the Domain Gateway. The Domain Gateway supports Digital-
 supplied access routines as either SLUs or PLUs. For example, the MEP
 VT for DEC SNA 3270 Applications Services access routine enables 3270
 terminals in an SNA network to connect to applications on OpenVMS sys-
 tems. For additional information about supported access routines, see
 the OPTIONAL SOFTWARE section of the System Support Addendum (SSA 38.69.01-
 x).

 Compatibility with Digital's DECnet SNA Gateways

 The Domain Gateway works with all of Digital's DECnet SNA access rou-
 tines except the Distributed Host Command Facility (DHCF). The access
 routines are described in the Access Routines section of this SPD. The
 Domain Gateway does not have an Remote Job Entry (RJE) server. Rather,
 the DECnet SNA RJE access routine uses an OpenVMS-based RJE server.
 Also note that the management utilities used for previous DECnet SNA
 Gateways, such as SNANCP, NCP, and NETTRACE, are not supported by the
 Domain Gateway.

 INSTALLATION

 In order for this product to be Digital warranted and supported, pur-
 chase of the Domain Gateway Orientation/Installation Service in con-
 junction with the customer's first purchase of a Domain Gateway is RE-
 QUIRED. For further details, please refer to the SOFTWARE PRODUCT SER-
 VICES section of this SPD.

 Only customers experienced with Digital's IBM interconnect products
 should attempt installation of second or subsequent Domain Gateways.
 Any Domain Gateway installations performed by customers are REQUIRED
 to be CERTIFIED by Digital prior to customer purchase of Domain Gate-
 way DECsupport Service, BASIC Service, or Self-Maintenance Service.
 CERTIFICATION is performed by Digital software specialists. For in-
 stallations that conform to the Software Product Description and can-
 not be certified, the customer must purchase DECnet/SNA Gateway Ori-
 entation/Installation Service to be eligible for DECnet/SNA Gateway
 DECsupport Service, BASIC service, or Self-Maintenance Service.

 SOFTWARE LICENSING

 Customers need a separate license for each hardware unit they load with
 the Domain Gateway software (except as otherwise specified by Digi-
 tal). The DEC SNA Domain Gateway license applies to the hardware unit
 on which the software executes, not to the load host processor on which
 the software is configured.

 The single Domain Gateway license agreement includes the right to in-
 stall and configure the product on a backup load host, in standby mode,
 for downline loading the Domain Gateway in case of a failure at the
 primary load host. This backup load host installation requires dupli-
 cate installation of the primary Product Access Key (PAK).

 Under the terms of the software license, the Domain Gateway manage-
 ment utilities which are included in this product (NCL commands, SNAP,
 and CTF analysis routines) may be installed freely on alternate Open-
 VMS Gateway management nodes in addition to the load host. A PAK is
 not necessary to install or execute the management utilities.

 This software is furnished under the licensing provision of Digital
 Equipment Corporation's Standard Terms and Conditions. For more in-
 formation about Digital's licensing terms and policies, contact the
 local Digital office.

 License Management Facility Support

 This product supports the OpenVMS License Management Facility.

 For more information on the License Management Facility refer to the
 OpenVMS Operating System Software Product Description (SPD 25.01.xx)
 or the License Management Facility manual of the OpenVMS Operating Sys-
 tem documentation set.
