   PRODUCT NAME:  DEC DB Integrator, Version 1.0B, for OpenVMS VAX SPD
   47.25.02

   DESCRIPTION

   DEC DB Integrator for OpenVMS VAX (DBI) is a multi-database manage-
   ment system that provides users with the capability to transparently
   access and update data stored in multiple databases, in distributed
   locations, and with multiple data formats. DEC DB Integrator enables
   users and applications to access this data as if it were located in
   a single, local database without regard to the actual location of the
   data or to the functional limitations of the underlying data managers.

   DBI services are accessible to a wide variety of client applications
   over DECnet, TCP/IP or Novell[R] networks using SQL, SQL/Services and
   the DEC ODBC Driver for MS[R] Windows[TM] application programming in-
   terfaces (APIs). DEC DB Integrator clients access underlying data sources
   via a full-featured implementation of SQL data manipulation language
   (DML).

   DEC DB Integrator provides clients with both remote request and dis-
   tributed request capabilities against underlying data sources. These
   sources, called link databases, include DEC Rdb, DEC DBMS, IBM[R] DB2[TM],
   ORACLE[R], SYBASE[R] databases, Digital Standard M (DSM) globals, OpenVMS
   RMS files and VSAM data sets.

   Features

   o  Multi-Database Management - Information in DEC Rdb, DEC DBMS, DB2,
      ORACLE and SYBASE databases, Digital Standard M (DSM) globals, VMS
      RMS files, and VSAM data sets can be integrated into a single fed-
      erated database through the use of DEC DB Integrator and turnkey
      DEC DB Integrator gateways (formally RdbAccess Gateways). DEC DBI

   DEC DB Integrator, Version 1.0B, for OpenVMS VAX      SPD 47.25.02


      Gateway for Custom Drivers supports the integration of data sources
      that lack turnkey DEC DBI gateways.

      Users can directly query DEC DB Integrator metadata to determine
      the availability and source of data within the federated database.

   o  Local Autonomy - Link databases are managed as independent enti-
      ties; DB Integrator imposes no restrictions on other uses of the
      underlying databases. Synchronizing DEC DB Integrator metadata with
      corresponding metadata in the link databases is accomplished through
      two DBA functions: one to update the DEC DB Integrator metadata for
      a specific table, the other to refresh only the table's statistics.

   o  Location Transparency - Remote and local data sources are accessed
      as if they reside in a single, local database. Tables may be joined
      with each other independent of the location of the link databases
      in which they physically reside.

   o  Functional Transparency - All data is accessed via a single imple-
      mentation of ANSI/ISO standard DEC SQL. Link database capabilities
      are supplemented by services provided by DBI and DBI gateways so
      that clients have access to a single, uniformly functional, fed-
      erated database.

      Some capabilities, such as identifying a record by its internal database
      object identifier (DB Key) or integration with DECdtm, the Digital
      implementation of the two phase commit (2PC) protocol, depend to-
      tally on link database capabilities and are not available for all
      link databases.

   o  Partitioned Views - Several similar tables located at different sites
      can be presented to clients as a single, horizontally partitioned
      table.

   o  Client Interoperability - Client applications with interfaces to
      the DEC ODBC Driver for MS Windows or the SQL/Services API can ac-
      cess DEC DB Integrator services via a SQL/Services server and DECnet,
      TCP/IP, Novell IPX/SPX or AppleTalk[R] network transports.

   o  Compatibility - Applications designed to work with DEC SQL data ma-
      nipulation language (DML) through either the compiled or dynamic
      SQL interfaces will work with DEC DB Integrator without any mod-
      ification other than changing the database name.

   o  Performance - DB Integrator accelerates the response time of com-
      plex queries/updates through distributed optimization techniques
      designed to minimize the movement of data across the network. The
      DB Integrator distributed query optimizer is both cost-based and
      capabilities-based resulting in efficient strategies for process-
      ing of user requests. Runaway queries may be controlled by limit-
      ing the CPU time, elapsed time and/or the rows returned by a spe-
      cific client request.

   o  Distributed Unit of Work Support - DEC DB Integrator uses DECdtm
      services to provide a transparent, two phase commit (2PC) for dis-
      tributed transactions that span multiple DEC Rdb databases, DEC DBMS
      databases or RMS files. DEC DB Integrator may be configured to al-
      low distributed updates across link databases that lack DECdtm sup-
      port. These updates may produce inconsistent results.

      Statement atomicity in distributed transactions is ensured through
      the use of the markpoint capabilities of the link database managers.

      For more information on DECdtm refer to the OpenVMS VAX Operating
      System SPD (25.01.xx)

   o  Data Dictionary Integration - Definitions of databases, domains,
      fields, tables and views may be maintained through the use of
      CDD/Repository. Sharing common definitions across databases and ap-
      plications fosters the consistent use of data within an organiza-
      tion.

   o  Security - DEC DB Integrator presents itself to the link databases
      as a user. Both responsibility for, and control of data access re-
      mains with the administrators of these link databases. Database ad-
      ministrators can control access to DEC DB Integrator metadata through
      privilege-based security mechanisms. DEC DB Integrator encrypts the
      proxy information it uses to attach to link databases.

   DEC DB Integrator, Version 1.0B, for OpenVMS VAX      SPD 47.25.02


   o  Data Type Support - All DEC SQL data types are supported. Data types
      unique to the link database managers are transparently mapped to
      corresponding DEC SQL data types. DEC SQL data type support includes:


      -  ASCII text (1 to 16,383 bytes)

      -  Varying string (1 to 16,383 bytes)

      -  Date (ANSI and VMS)

      -  Signed byte (1 byte)

      -  Signed word (16-bit) integer

      -  Signed longword (32-bit) integer

      -  Signed quadword (64-bit) integer

      -  Single precision floating point (F_floating)

      -  Double precision floating point (G_floating)

      -  List cursors (Segmented strings) for storing large amounts of
         unstructured data or multimedia objects such as documents, voice,
         or graphics. Access to list cursor data types is limited to read-
         only.

   o  Language Support - Precompilers for DEC C, DEC Ada, DEC COBOL, DEC
      Fortran, DEC Pascal and PL/I for OpenVMS are available with the pur-
      chase of a Full Development Option.

   o  Data Integrity - Access to link databases will not override the busi-
      ness rules established in, and enforced by, the data managers of
      those databases.

   Run-Time Only Option:       53,000 blocks
                               (26 MB)

   Disk space required for use (permanent)


   Development Option:         53,000blocks
                               (26 MB)

   Interactive Option:         41,000 blocks
                               (21 MB)

   Run-Time Only Option:       41,000 blocks
                               (21 MB)

   Approximately 28,000 blocks (14 MB) of this requirement is for soft-
   ware components common to DEC DB Integrator (DBI) and the DBI family
   of gateways. If one of these products is already installed on a sys-
   tem or VMScluster, the additional disk space required for the instal-
   lation and use of this product will be reduced by approximately this
   (14 MB) amount.

   In addition, the use of an ORACLE V7 database for storage of metadata
   will increase the requirement for both installation and use for all
   options by 3,000 blocks (1.5 MB).
