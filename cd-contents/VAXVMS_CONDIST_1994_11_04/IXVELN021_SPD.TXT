           PRODUCT NAME:  IXV/VAXELN Driver,            SPD 29.18.02
                          Version 2.1

           DESCRIPTION

           The IXV/VAXELN driver enables a user to perform I/O to/from
           the IXV11/IXV1S-Modules. The driver is supplied as a sub-
           routine library that the user has to include in the appli-
           cation software at compile and link time. The user can build
           a bootable VAXELN system (using the VAXELN Toolkit), which
           is booted on a target machine in order to perform its task
           of a dedicated stand-alone real-time application. This type
           of design implies that an application calling the driver rou-
           tines must run in Kernel Mode. The design also prohibits ac-
           cessing a given device from more than one job; however, gain-
           ing access from different processes within the same job is
           possible, provided the caller ensures there is no simulta-
           neous access to the same device. Furthermore, the job can
           be used as a server enabling other jobs on the system to ac-
           cess the IXV devices.

           The VAXELN Toolkit is a VMS layered product for the devel-
           opment of dedicated, real-time VAXELN systems that run on
           VAX and MicroVAX processors. The development tools run on
           a ``host'' VAX processor under the VMS Operating System. A
           finished VAXELN system using the IXV/VAXELN driver runs di-
           rectly on a ``target'' MicroVAX processor, without the pres-
           ence of another operating system.

           The IXV11/IXV1S Module Family is a group of industrial dig-
           ital input/output, analog input/output, and counter inter-
           faces for Digital Equipment Corporation's Q-bus machines.

           These interfaces are:

           respective IXV11/VMS Driver (IxV11 always implies IxV1S) (SPD
           28.28.xx) featuring:

           o  Digital Input/Output requests support the following modes
              of operation:

              -  Read data from one or several IDV1x-A modules.

              -  Write data to one or several IDV1x-B or IDV1x-C mod-
                 ules.

              -  Read or write fractions of a 16-bit value.

              -  Interrupts can be handled in a user process by AST rou-
                 tines.

           o  Analog Input/Output requests support the following modes
              of operation:

              -  Read data from one or several (up to 128 different)
                 channels on IAV1x-A, -AA and IAV1x-C, -CA modules.

           Version 2.1

              -  Write data to one or several (up to four different)
                 channels on IAV1x-B modules.

              -  Automatic gain selection can be enabled.

              -  Multiple reads on one channel can be initiated with
                 one request.

              -  Conversion can be started internally or externally.

              Although the number of different channels is limited to
              128, it is possible to read each channel more than once
              with one request.

           o  The Counter functions support the following modes of op-
              eration:

              -  Start or stop one or more (up to five) counter chan-
                 nels simultaneously on one IDV1x-D module.

              -  Counting upwards or downwards can be selected per chan-
                 nel.

              -  Every channel can be preset with an initial value.

              -  A counter overflow and/or underflow can be handled in
                 a user AST routine.

              -  Count of external events controlled by internal or ex-
                 ternal start signal.

              -  Count of selectable internal time intervals upon ex-
                 ternal control signal (time measurements).

              -  Concatenating consecutive counter channels.
