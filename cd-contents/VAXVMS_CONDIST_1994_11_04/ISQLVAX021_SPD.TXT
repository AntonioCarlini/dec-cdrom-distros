 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC InstantSQL for OpenVMS VAX Systems  SPD 37.60.03
                Version 2.1A

 DESCRIPTION

 DEC InstantSQL for OpenVMS (InstantSQL) is a graphical user interface
 for DEC Rdb databases. It provides broad support for DEC Rdb Data Ma-
 nipulation Language (DML) and limited support for DEC Rdb Data Def-
 inition Language (DDL).

 InstantSQL can be used to define, create, access, update and organize
 data in these databases through on-screen manipulation of icons and
 widgets that represent underlying database objects. Complex relational
 queries, updates and metadata definitions can be generated in this highly
 visual, windowed environment, without having to express those oper-
 ations in SQL language. By manipulating the graphical objects on the
 screen, users can generate SQL syntax or SQL module language which can
 then be edited, compiled and linked with database application programs.
 InstantSQL assists individuals and organizations with and without SQL
 language skills to implement database applications based on standard
 SQL by sheltering the user from the syntax and semantics of SQL.

 Features

 Graphical User Interface

 The InstantSQL interface design is based on the X Window System[TM].
 The main window on the user's display server includes a menu bar and
 a graphical presentation of the tables and columns in the selected database.
 Data and metadata objects in the database are manipulated by select-
 ing and modifying the window objects that represent them. Changes to
 these objects are reflected both in the main window and in a spreadsheet-
 like window that displays the values of the selected rows and columns.

                               DIGITAL                      May 1994

                                                         AE-PM4HD-TE

 

 The definition of operations is guided through the use of screen wid-
 gets and context-sensitive menus. Menus, options, and objects are se-
 lected by a pointing device (mouse).

 Through the use of this interface, the user creates and executes SQL
 statements that select and update database objects. Based on the graph-
 ical manipulations on the screen, the user can generate SQL or SQL mod-
 ule language which can be edited, compiled, and linked with database
 application programs. Other features of the user interface are:

 o  Top level menu bar with pull-down menus for File, Edit, Queries,
    Metadata, Window, and Help

 o  Context-sensitive, pop-up menus for commonly used menu items

 o  Spreadsheet-like window with horizontal and vertical scrolling for
    displaying selected rows and columns

 o  Direct access to specific rows in a selection

 o  Export of selected rows and columns to an ASCII file

 o  Editable display of generated SQL module language representing the
    set of relational operations in a transaction

 o  Navigation of larger schemas supported by both scroll bars and a
    navigation window

 o  Extensive online help provided through the DECwindows Motif[R] Help
    system

 SQL Language Support

 The InstantSQL interface implements the following relational opera-
 tions and constructs:

 o  SELECT

 o  SHOW

 o  Sorting (ORDER BY)

 o  Relational joins

 o  Query predicates (WHERE clause)

                                  2

 

 o  GROUP BY

 o  HAVING clause

 o  DISTINCT

 o  LIMIT TO

 o  Subqueries (one level deep)

 o  Computed columns

 o  Insert, update, and delete row

 o  Create/alter/drop table

 o  Create/alter/drop column

 o  Create/drop view

 o  Create/drop domain

 o  COMMIT/ROLLBACK

 Client/Server Architecture

 InstantSQL uses DECwindows Motif as its graphical user interface. DECwindows
 Motif is a Digital implementation of the MIT X Window System[TM]. This
 client/server architecture enables users to access InstantSQL appli-
 cations either locally, from the workstation on which it is installed,
 or remotely, from a variety of X Window System display servers.

 Data Manager Support

 InstantSQL can be used with DEC Rdb databases on OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS
 AXP platforms.

 CONFORMANCE TO STANDARDS

 InstantSQL is based on DEC SQL which implements the American National
 Standard Database Language SQL. Refer to SPD 52.91.xx for a complete
 description of DEC SQL conformance to this and other standards.

 Processors Not Supported

               MicroVAX I, VAXstation I,
               VAX-11/725, VAX-11/782,
               VAXstation 8000

 Processor Restrictions

 o  All processors require mass storage units to back up and restore
    established databases.

 o  All processors require a minimum of 8M bytes of memory.

 o  All processors require a device for installation of the software.

 o  ECO level 4 or later and WCS microcode version 123 or later are re-
    quired for VAX-11/780 or VAX-11/785 processors

 o  ECO level 3 or later required for VAX-11/750 processors

 Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1)

 Disk space required for    11,500 blocks
 installation:
                            (6M bytes)

 Disk space required for    11,500 blocks
 use (permanent):
                            (6M bytes)

 These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
 sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
 system environment, configuration, and software options.

 Memory Requirements

 The performance and memory usage of DECwindows applications are par-
 ticularly sensitive to system configuration. A minimum of 8M bytes of
 memory is recommended to use InstantSQL in the OpenVMS VAX system en-
 vironment. This minimum applies both use as an application accessed
 by remote X servers and as a standalone application on a VAXstation

                                  7

 

 accessed by the local X server. More memory may be required if a sys-
 tem is running several applications or if there is a need to maximize
 performance.

 display server. Display server software is listed under the OPTIONAL
 SOFTWARE section. Hardware Requirements for specific display server
 software are described in the SPD for that software.
