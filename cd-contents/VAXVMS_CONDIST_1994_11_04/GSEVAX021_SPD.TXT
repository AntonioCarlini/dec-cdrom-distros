 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC Graphical Schema Editor for         SPD 41.23.02
                OpenVMS VAX Systems, Version 2.1A

 DESCRIPTION

 DEC Graphical Schema Editor for OpenVMS (GSE) is an advanced tool for
 designing and editing DEC Rdb schemas. Whether the users are database
 administrators, analysts, or designers, GSE helps them to quickly cre-
 ate, edit, and print both the logical and physical schemas, provid-
 ing a more intuitive and user-friendly approach to the SQL Database
 Definition Language (DDL) without compromising the power of SQL.
 GSE allows the user to graphically create, browse, delete, and mod-
 ify DEC Rdb schema elements including:

 o  Domains

 o  Columns

 o  Tables

 o  Views

 o  Constraints

 o  Triggers

 o  Protections

 o  Indexes

 o  Storage areas

 o  Storage maps

                               DIGITAL                      May 1994

                                                         AE-PRB2C-TE

 

 GSE provides complete support for the SQL DDL language with an SQL im-
 port parser and SQL export functionality. SQL DML for views and trig-
 gers is also fully supported. Use GSE to create new schemas, or doc-
 ument and modify existing schemas. The user can import existing schemas
 into GSE from a DEC Rdb rootfile, DEC SQL command file, or even SQL
 files generated by CASE tools.

 GSE stores schemas in the repository that it shares with DEC RdbExpert
 for OpenVMS VAX (RdbExpert). RdbExpert can use GSE schemas as input
 into the physical database design process, and GSE can read and edit
 schemas generated by RdbExpert.

 Features

 o  Design Hierarchy - Provides a structure for organizing, document-
    ing, and experimenting with different logical and physical schemas
    with minimal duplication of data. RdbExpert uses the same design
    hierarchy.

 o  Consistency Checker - Validates the semantics of the schema and re-
    ports errors so that they can be fixed within the GSE before gen-
    erating SQL for the schema.

 o  Cross-Referencing Utility - Makes dependency management easy by list-
    ing the name and type of all objects that make use of a given schema
    object. For example, you can see which columns make use of a par-
    ticular domain, or find out which views, triggers, indexes, etc.,
    will have to be modified when you rename or delete a particular ta-
    ble.

 o  Physical Schema Report - An easy-to-read, tabular report describes
    the attributes and contents of each storage area, provides a list
    of indexes for each table including index type and columns as well
    as placement information. Use the report to document schemas ei-
    ther before or after they are modified by GSE.

 o  Redesign Command Procedure - Automates the conversion of an exist-
    ing database to a new design format by unloading and reloading the
    data. This is particularly useful when reorganizing multi-file databases.

                                  2

 

 o  SQL Generation - Generates complete logical and/or physical schema
    DDL

 o  Persistent Storage - Saves all schemas in a design database. RdbExpert
    uses the same repository.

 o  Navigation - Lets the user work quickly with very large schemas by
    positioning the center focus of the window on a given schema ob-
    ject.

 o  Find - Lets the user locate a named schema object for manipulation.

 o  Client/Server Architecture - GSE uses DECwindows Motif[R] as its
    graphical user interface. DECwindows Motif is a Digital implemen-
    tation of the MIT X Window System[TM]. This client/server archi-
    tecture enables users to access GSE applications either locally,
    from the workstation on which GSE is installed, or remotely, from
    a variety of X Window System display servers.

 CONFORMANCE TO STANDARDS

 GSE is based on DEC SQL which implements the American National Stan-
 dard Database Language SQL. Refer to SPD 52.91.xx for a complete de-
 scription of DEC SQL conformance to this and other standards.

 Processors Not Supported

               MicroVAX I, VAXstation I,
               VAX-11/725, VAX-11/782,
               VAXstation 8000

 Processor Restrictions

 o  All processors require mass storage units to back up and restore
    established databases.

 o  All processors require a minimum of 12M bytes of memory.

 o  All processors require a device for installation of the software.

 o  ECO level 4 or later and WCS microcode version 123 or later are re-
    quired for VAX-11/780 or VAX-11/785 processors

 o  ECO level 3 or later required for VAX-11/750 processors

 Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1):

 Disk space required for    36,000 blocks
 installation:
                            (18M bytes)

                                  6

 


 Disk space required for    20,500 blocks
 use (permanent):
                            (10M bytes)

 These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
 sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
 system environment, configuration, and software options. These counts
 are for the product software only. They do not include space for user
 data and files associated with product usage.

 Memory Requirements

 The performance and memory usage of DECwindows applications are par-
 ticularly sensitive to system configuration. A minimum of 12M bytes
 of memory is recommended to use GSE on VAX Systems. This minimum ap-
 plies both use as an application accessed by remote X servers and as
 a standalone application on a VAXstation accessed by the local X server.
 More memory may be required if a system is running several applica-
 tions or there is a need to maximize performance.

 Other Performance Considerations

 The selection of a hardware platform should take into consideration
 the size of schemas that will be created and maintained. System speed
 and capacity determines the time it will take to load the schema from
 the design directory into the GSE window. For example, it may take 1.5
 minutes to load a schema with 50 tables on a VAXstation 3100 while it
 may take over an hour to load a schema with over 500 tables using the
 same machine. A faster VAX processor with more memory and greater I/O
 capacity could substantially reduce that time required to load the larger
 schema.
