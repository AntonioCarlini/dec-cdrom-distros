 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC SNA 3270 Application Services,      SPD 38.70.02
                Version 1.1

 DESCRIPTION

 The DEC SNA 3270 Application Services layered software product is a
 member of the DEC SNA Programming Access Routines family of products.
 This family of layered software products consists of a variety of pro-
 gramming access routines that enable communications between IBM[R] and
 Digital applications.

 The DEC SNA 3270 Application Services software provides a library of
 callable routines and other components for building OpenVMS and DEC
 OSF/1[R] applications which support processing of IBM 3270 data stream.
 When used with the DEC SNA Domain Gateway these 3270 data stream ap-
 plications can be accessed from SNA networked 3270 block mode termi-
 nal and PC users. Refer to the DEC SNA Domain Gateway Software Prod-
 uct Description (SPD 38.69.xx) for more information.

 The DEC SNA 3270 Application Services software provides the follow-
 ing components:

 o  An application programming interface (API) for developing 3270 data
    stream applications

 o  An OpenVMS print symbiont for printing ASCII files on SNA-attached
    LU Type 1 or Type 3 printers and non-SNA-attached LU Type 0 print-
    ers (OpenVMS only)

 o  DECforms support for building forms oriented applications for 3270
    terminals (OpenVMS only)

 o  A DEC Videotex (VTX) program which allows IBM 3270 terminals to ac-
    cess VTX infobases located on Digital systems (OpenVMS only)

                               DIGITAL                    April 1994

                                                        AE-PN5QC-TE

 

 o  A mechanism for testing applications without an SNA network

 Application Programming Interface

 The 3270 Application Services API provides a library of routines for
 developing 3270 data stream applications. These applications can be
 SNA LU Type 1, 2, or 3 applications or non-SNA LU Type 0 applications
 and can serve as the primary logical unit (PLU) and activate a ses-
 sion with the remote 3270 device as secondary logical unit (SLU) in
 the SNA network.

 The API is callable from any OpenVMS language conforming to the Open-
 VMS calling standard on OpenVMS Systems and from the C language on DEC
 OSF/1 systems.

 The application that calls the DEC SNA 3270 Application Services API
 is responsible for generating and interpreting all 3270 data stream.
 The API provides the following features:

 o  Receives incoming LU Type 0, 1, 2, and 3 connections

 o  Initiates outgoing LU Type 0, 1, 2, and 3 connections

 o  Establishes and terminates sessions

 o  Transmits and receives data

 o  Implements the protocols for chaining, bracketing, responses, and
    session and data flow control

 o  On DEC OSF/1, the API is Pthreads safe

 The API provides integrated block mode access and VT emulation. In this
 way, applications written to use the API may also be run interactively
 by 3270 users while running MEP VT. See the Optional Products section
 for a description of the MEP VT product.

 Print Symbiont (OpenVMS only)

 The 3270 Application Services software provides a 3270 OpenVMS print
 symbiont for printing local ASCII files on an SNA-attached LU Type 1
 or Type 3 printer or non-SNA attached LU Type 0 printer from an Open-
 VMS print queue.

 The 3270 OpenVMS print symbiont allows system managers to initiate and
 start OpenVMS print queues. Users can print files on SNA-attached print-
 ers. The following features are available for OpenVMS users:

 o  Burst, flag, and trailer pages

 o  Print form specification

 o  Automatic session establishment, retry on error

 o  LU type 1 printer console commands

 o  DCL queue management commands

 Other features of the print symbiont include:

 o  Prints all types of sequential RMS files including FORTRAN and Print
    file types, except for non-PRN VFC files.

 o  Data can be sent to the printer untranslated and unformatted. This
    is useful if the printer is an ASCII printer attached to the SNA
    network. This is supported for LU type 1 printers only.

 o  Symbiont can either pass through escape sequences or strip them out.

 o  Translation can be controlled on a queue-by-queue basis. In this
    way, sites with need to use multiple translation tables are accom-
    modated.

 o  Certain IBM applications keep the printers bound unless they get
    a NOTIFY indication in the C(D)INIT. Connections are now queued un-
    til the application unbinds.

 o  The symbiont uses the FORM qualifier to set the size of the mar-
    gins. Text that goes beyond those margins is truncated.

                                  3

 

 DECforms for 3270 Terminals (OpenVMS only)

 DEC SNA 3270 Applications Services provides support for the DECforms
 product to enable the development of forms oriented applications which
 can be accessed by SNA networked 3270 terminal and PC users. These DEC-
 forms applications can be developed without knowledge of 3270 Data Stream,
 SNA, or the DEC SNA Application Services software. DECforms is Dig-
 ital's implementation of the ANSI/ISO standard for a Form Interface
 Management System (FIMS). Refer to the DECforms Software Product De-
 scription (SPD 29.90.xx) for additional information.

 DEC Videotex (VTX) Support (OpenVMS only)

 DEC SNA 3270 Applications Services provides support for the VTX Con-
 centrator program to enable VTX to be accessed from SNA-attached 3270
 terminals without requiring an IBM host-based CICS application.

 Videotex provides application developers a distributed information re-
 trieval service that includes components for programming applications.
 Refer to the DEC VTX Software Product Description (SPD 26.57.xx) for
 more information on VTX features.

 Application Testing Tools

 The DEC SNA Domain Gateway is required for 3270 access; however, a 3270
 Terminal Emulator provides a method for preliminary testing of incom-
 ing sessions by emulating the SLU side of a session. For example test-
 ing can be done with the DECnet/SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator for Open-
 VMS (SPD 26.84.xx), or the DECwindows DECnet/SNA 3270 Terminal Emu-
 lator for OpenVMS (SPD 31.58.xx).

 The DEC SNA 3270 Application Services SNALOG trace utility provides
 debugging facilities to debug applications layered on DEC SNA 3270 Ap-
 plication Services.

 OPTIONAL PRODUCTS

 MEP VT for DEC SNA 3270 Application Services (OpenVMS VAX only)

 The INTEGRATA MEP VT is an OpenVMS terminal emulation software pack-
 age that allows 3270 users to access unmodified applications on Open-
 VMS systems. MEP VT provides full-screen access to OpenVMS applica-
 tions including ALL-IN-1, existing OpenVMS-based customer applications,
 and utilities such as OpenVMS Mail.

 In addition, the 3270 user can run 3270-ready DECforms applications
 in block mode from the MEP VT emulator. This also applies to appli-
 cations written to the API. This provides the benefits of block mode
 access, while accessing the program through a VT emulation terminal
 session.

 MEP VT for DEC SNA 3270 Application Services is a worldwide Digital
 Distributed and Supported (DDS) product from INTEGRATA, AG, Tubingen
 Germany. Refer to SPD 44.00.xx for additional information.

 (SPD 38.69.xx).

 Disk Space Requirements

 For OpenVMS systems:

 Without DECforms

 Disk space re-      7,100 blocks
 quired for instal-  (3,550 Kbytes)
 lation:

 Disk space re-      4,600 blocks
 quired for use      (2,300 Kbytes)
 (permanent):

 Disk space re-      22,000 blocks
 quired for instal-  (11,000 Kbytes)
 lation:

 use(permanent):

 These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
 sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
 system environment, configuration, and software options.
