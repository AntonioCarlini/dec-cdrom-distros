 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC X.500 Directory Service             SPD 40.77.04

 DESCRIPTION

 Introduction

 The DEC[TM] X.500 Directory Service products are an implementation of
 the ISO and CCITT series of standards and recommendations for Direc-
 tory Services. ISO and CCITT have defined models and protocols for Di-
 rectory Services which enable software vendors to build products that
 can work together to provide a single, scalable, networked Directory
 Service. The purpose of such a Directory Service is to store and pro-
 vide access to information about objects such as people, computers,
 peripherals, and applications.

 The DEC X.500 Directory Service products covered by this Software Prod-
 uct Description are:

 o  DEC X.500 Directory Service Starter Kit

 o  DEC X.500 Directory Server

 o  DEC X.500 Administration Facility

 The DEC X.500 Directory Service Starter Kit contains licenses for both
 the DEC X.500 Directory Server and the DEC X.500 Administration Fa-
 cility.

 The DEC X.500 Directory Server product provides a Directory System Agent
 (DSA).

 The DEC X.500 Administration Facility product provides a Directory User
 Agent (DUA).

 The DEC X.500 Directory Service products are based on the 1993 edi-
 tion of ISO/IEC 9594 and the CCITT X.500 series of Recommendations.

 Version Numbers and Operating Systems

 Abstract Services

 The DEC X.500 Directory Service components provide and support all of
 the X.500 Abstract Services, including:

    Read         Read attributes from a named entry

    Compare      Test an attribute value without reading it

    Abandon      Abandon an outstanding operation

    List         List names of subordinate entries

    Search       Find entries matching a search expression

    Add          Create a new entry

    Remove       Delete an entry

    Modify       Add or remove attributes or values
    Entry

    Modify RDN   Rename an entry

 Schema

 The DEC X.500 Directory Service uses a configurable schema allowing
 customer definition of attributes, object classes, structure rules,
 and name forms. The schema is installed individually at each DSA. A

                                  2

 

 default schema that implements the schema in X.520 and X.521 (1993 edi-
 tion) as well as other useful definitions is included.

 Security

 The DEC X.500 Directory Service supports a subset of the Simplified
 Access Control scheme from the 1993 edition of the standard. This al-
 lows administrators to define policies that control access rights (such
 as read, browse, modify, remove) to entries and individual attributes
 within a particular part of the directory (naming context).

 The DEC X.500 Directory Service allows for the authentication of users
 by name and password. It also allows access to be restricted based on
 network address, and, for chained operations, originating DSA.

 Distributed Operations

 The DSA supports standard X.500 distributed operations including chain-
 ing and referrals. Knowledge management of superior and subordinate
 references allows a DEC X.500 DSA to participate as a first-level DSA
 or a subordinate DSA in a multi-vendor distributed Directory Infor-
 mation Base (DIB).

 Replication

 The DEC X.500 Directory Service supports shadowing of data between DSAs,
 allowing data to be replicated in the network for availability and per-
 formance. Shadowing also allows replication of knowledge information
 for distributed operation, access control policies and authentication
 information, thus reducing the amount of management required.

 Shadowed information is represented using the DSA Information Model
 defined in the 1993 edition of the standard, thus easing the transi-
 tion to a conformant implementation of the X.500 DISP protocol. In the
 current versions of the DEC X.500 Directory Service, a simple Digital-
 defined protocol is used to transfer the shadowed information.




                                  3

 

 Protocols

 The Directory Service is based on the client-server model. The DSA server
 supports the directorySystemAC application context (DSP protocol) to
 communicate with other DSAs. Communications between server DSAs and
 client DUAs are supported by the directoryAccessAC application con-
 text (DAP protocol). DAP enables DUAs in other X.500 implementations
 to access the DEC X.500 Directory Service DSA and vice-versa. DSP en-
 ables full interworking with DSAs in other implementations.

 The DEC X.500 Directory Service runs on the DEC OSF/1 AXP, OpenVMS AXP,
 OpenVMS VAX and ULTRIX RISC operating systems. It provides integrated,
 multi-protocol support allowing concurrent DAP and DSP access over OSI
 (using transport classes TP0, TP2, TP4) and, on DEC OSF/1 AXP and UL-
 TRIX RISC, RFC1006 over TCP/IP.

 Database

 The DEC X.500 Directory Service provides a Directory Information Base
 based on the 1993 edition of Extended Information Models. This indexed
 database supports high-performance searching and sophisticated match-
 ing including approximate (Soundex) match. The database is held in main
 memory to ensure optimal response times.

 Service Management

 The DEC X.500 Directory Service provides DSA management conforming to
 Digital's Enterprise Management Architecture (EMA), integrated with
 DECnet/OSI[TM]. This provides remote management facilities to config-
 ure and control DSAs, and to log significant events.

 Programming Interface

 The DEC X.500 Directory Service provides the X/Open[TM] XDS/XOM Ap-
 plication Program Interface so that customers can construct their own
 DUA applications.




                                  4

 

 Directory User Agents

 The DEC X.500 Administration Facility provides a Directory User Agent.
 The Information Management Utility (DXIM) allows users to search and
 browse the directory and to maintain the data stored in it. Operations
 include the addition, modification, and deletion of entries. DXIM sup-
 ports both DECwindows[TM] Motif[R] and command line interfaces. It can
 be used on a DSA node or remotely from any other node in the network.

 DXIM is configurable, based on the schema definitions, to support customer-
 defined attributes and classes.

 STANDARDS SUPPORTED

 The DEC X.500 Directory Service products are implemented according to
 the drafts of the 1993 edition of ISO/IEC 9594 and the CCITT X.500 se-
 ries of Recommendations. The products are designed to conform to the
 1988 version of these standards.

 The products are designed and implemented to conform, with some mi-
 nor exceptions, to the following European and US profiles:

 o  NIST OIW Stable Implementor's Agreements - Version 5 edition 1

 o  ENV 41210

 o  ENV 41212

 o  ENV 41215

 o  ENV 41512

 The products also support, where applicable, the following Internet
 standards:

 o  RFC 1006

 o  RFC 1274

 o  RFC 1277 (as it applies to TCP/IP networks)

 o  RFC 1278

 Disk Space Requirements

 These counts below refer to the disk space required on the system disk

 vary depending on the user's system environment, configuration, and
 software options selected.

 Where individually specified, the counts refer to the space required
 to install the X.500 Server, Administration, and Application Program-
 ming components. The Base component is a mandatory component for all
 installations. Permanent disk space requirements for the components
 are cumulative. Directory data files are not included and will require
 additional space which can be on a non-system disk.

 Memory Requirements

 The minimum memory supported is 16 Mbytes. However, the use of this
 software in conjunction with increased memory capability improves per-
 formance. The memory size suggested for most typical hardware config-
 urations is at least 32 Mbytes. On systems running the Directory Server,
 memory usage increases in proportion to the amount of data stored in
 the database.

 CLUSTER ENVIRONMENT

 This layered product is fully supported when installed on any valid
 and licensed VAXcluster[TM]* configuration without restrictions. Only
 one Directory System Agent (DSA) can be active on a single node or VAX-
 cluster at any one time. The HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS section of this doc-
 ument details any special hardware required by this product.

 *  VAXcluster configurations are fully described in the VAXcluster Soft-
    ware Product Description (29.78.xx) and include CI, Ethernet, and
    Mixed Interconnect configurations.
