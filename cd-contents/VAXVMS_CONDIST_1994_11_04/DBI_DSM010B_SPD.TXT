     PRODUCT NAME:  DEC DB Integrator Gateway            SPD 51.15.00
                    for DSM, Version 1.0

     DESCRIPTION

     The DEC DB Integrator (DBI) family of gateways enable applica-
     tions compatible with DEC Rdb programming interfaces to access
     information sources other than DEC Rdb databases.

     The DEC DB Integrator Gateway for DSM (gateway for DSM) allows
     transparent access to Digital Standard M (DSM) data, using
     the DEC Rdb for OpenVMS implementation of the Structured Query
     Language (SQL) interfaces. These interfaces include interactive
     SQL, dynamic SQL, precompiled SQL, and SQL module language.
     Support for client/server access is provided by SQL/Services
     and a driver for Microsoft® Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
     clients.

     The gateway for DSM retrieves the data definitions for DSM data
     sources from a variety of data sources and data definition
     (metadata) sources, or both. It provides support for Digital
     Application Software Library (DASL) tables, FileMan files,
     and user-defined data and metadata sources, by providing an M
     routine call interface definition. The gateway for DSM emulates
     a relational database by combining the source data and its
     associated definitions.

     Non-SQL Data Server

     The Non-SQL Data Server (NSDS) is the component that brings data
     and data definitions together and makes them appear relational.
     NSDS enables applications to access this nonrelational data in a
     relational manner. NSDS plans, optimizes, and executes read and
     write operations.

     for DSM, Version 1.0


     DSM Data and Metadata Drivers

     The DSM data driver and metadata driver implement routines
     required by NSDS. They call into DSM using the DSM Callable
     Routines Facility, using routine entry points defined in a
     call level interface description. Multiple sets of DSM support
     routines can implement these entry points.

     DASL and FileMan Support Routines

     Implementations of the routine entry points to support Digi-
     tal's DASL data dictionary and the public domain FileMan data
     dictionary are provided.

     Call Level Interface

     A Call Level Interface Description is provided for those devel-
     oping their own support routines, as well as source code for the
     DASL and FileMan support routines.

     Support by User Routines

     The gateway for DSM provides for read and write access if sup-
     ported by the user's support routines. Transaction support is
     provided in the Non-SQL Data Server and is available if sup-
     ported by the support routines. The DASL and FileMan support
     routines can provide all of these features.

     SQL Programming Interfaces

     The gateway for DSM includes SQL interfaces for interactive SQL,
     dynamic SQL, and a SQL/Services server to support client/server
     implementations.

     o  The interactive SQL interface supports Data Manipulation Lan-
        guage (DML) features of DEC SQL. These features include the
        operations: insert, select, update, delete, join, project,
        and order.

     for DSM, Version 1.0


     o  The dynamic SQL interface compiles and executes SQL requests
        passed through its call interface. This programming approach
        is highly effective in applications such as ad-hoc query
        where the exact parameters of requests are not known until
        runtime. It is compatible with all programming languages
        that support the OpenVMS calling standard. The dynamic memory
        handling capabilities of DEC Ada and and DEC C enable these
        languages to take full advantage of the power and flexibility
        of this approach.

     o  The gateway for DSM performs all data format translations for
        supported OpenVMS datatypes as part of processing requests to
        read or update data.

     Desktop Connectivity

     The SQL/Services Server and Client Application Programming
     Interface (API) included with the gateway for DSM enable client
     applications on MS-DOS®, Microsoft Windows, OS/2®, Macintosh,
     ULTRIX, or OpenVMS platforms to read and update gateway DSM data
     sources. Many desktop applications offer SQL/Services compatible
     client applications. The following table describes SQL/Services
     network support.

     for Microsoft Windows. This driver, installed on the Microsoft
     Windows ODBC client, provides access to SQL/Services servers
     over DECnet or TCP/IP network transports. This driver also
     provides these applications with access to DEC Rdb databases
     and other DEC DB Integrator Gateway products.

     Integration with DEC SQL Applications

     DSM databases are accessible by Digital information management
     and end-user access tools.

     o  DEC Data Distributor can maintain extracts and rollups of DSM
        tables and views in DEC Rdb databases.

     o  DEC RALLY applications can query and report DSM sources.

     Optional SQL Application Development Tools

     In addition to the SQL interfaces that are included with the
     gateway for DSM, several optional software products are also
     available.

     o  The Full Development Option of DEC SQL includes support for
        embedded SQL. This option includes SQL precompilers for DEC
        C, DEC COBOL, DEC Fortran, DEC Pascal, DEC Ada, and DEC PL/1.

     This approach allows SQL language statements to be embedded
     directly in the host language program. The precompiler for the
     host language compiles the SQL statements and uses the host
     language compiler to create object modules that can then be
     linked as executable images.

     These precompilers support an optional Federal Information Pro-
     cessing Standards (FIPS) flagger, allowing the user to identify
     any SQL statements that are not in the current ANSI/ISO SQL
     standard. An exception flagger for the Multivendor Integration
     Architecture (MIA) standard is also provided.

     for DSM, Version 1.0


     o  The Full Development Option of DEC SQL also includes SQL
        module language and the SQL module processor. These facili-
        ties allow SQL statements and multistatement procedures to be
        grouped into modules and to be compiled. The resulting object
        modules can be linked with objects created by language com-
        pilers that comply with the OpenVMS calling standard. The SQL
        module language compiler also provides FIPS and MIA flagging.

     The DEC SQL Full Development Option also includes SQL/Services
     client application programming libraries for supported plat-
     forms. SQL/Services client applications on OpenVMS can be writ-
     ten in any language that supports the OpenVMS calling standard.
     MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows client applications should be writ-
     ten in Microsoft C. Macintosh client applications can be written
     in MPW C or ThinkC.

     which the gateway for DSM relies on, implements the ANSI/ISO SQL
     standard.
