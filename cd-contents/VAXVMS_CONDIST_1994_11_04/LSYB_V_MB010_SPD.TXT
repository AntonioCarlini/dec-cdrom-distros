   PRODUCT NAME:  DEC DB Integrator Gateway for SYBASE[R] SPD 47.35.02
                  Version 1.0B for OpenVMS VAX

   DESCRIPTION

   DEC DB Integrator Gateway for SYBASE for OpenVMS VAX (SYBASE Gateway)
   provides applications and tools with direct, read/write access to SYBASE
   SQL Server databases. This access can be via interactive or dynamic
   SQL interfaces. Support for client/server access is provided by the
   SQL/Services server and the DEC ODBC driver for MS[R] Windows[TM]. Op-
   tional support for embedded SQL and SQL module language programming
   is available.

   The SYBASE Gateway also provides native integration with DEC DB Integrator
   (DBI). DBI extends the functionality of the SYBASE Gateway by provid-
   ing persistent DBI Catalog storage of the SYBASE SQL Server metadata
   and the ability to do cross-database joins.

   The SYBASE Gateway runs under the OpenVMS VAX Operating System on Digital
   VAX, MicroVAX, VAXstation, VAXserver and VAXft systems, servers and
   workstations.

   Features

   Standard DEC SQL Interfaces

   The SYBASE Gateway provides direct, read/write access to SYBASE databases
   through standard DEC SQL interfaces. These interfaces include a dy-
   namic SQL interface, an interactive SQL facility and the SQL/Services
   server.

   SQL data manipulation language (DML) is fully supported. SQL data def-
   inition language (DDL) support is limited to operations required to
   create and maintain domains and tables and to grant and revoke access
   to database objects.

                                 DIGITAL                     July 1994

                                                           AE-Q2BCC-TE

 



   DEC DB Integrator Gateway for SYBASE[R]               SPD 47.35.02
   Version 1.0B for OpenVMS VAX

   The dynamic SQL interface compiles and executes SQL requests passed
   through its call interface. This programming approach is highly ef-
   fective in applications such as ad-hoc query where the exact param-
   eters of requests are not known until runtime. It is compatible with
   any programming language that supports the OpenVMS calling standard.
   The dynamic memory handling capabilities of DEC Ada and DEC C enable
   these languages to take full advantage of the power and flexibility
   of this approach.

   The interactive SQL facility supports interactive query and update of
   SYBASE SQL Server data as well as management of SQL Server metadata
   descriptions for tables and domains.

   All data format translations for supported OpenVMS datatypes are per-
   formed automatically as part of handling requests to read and update
   data in SYBASE SQL Server databases.

   Desktop Connectivity

   Microsoft[R] Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) applications can read
   from, and write to, SYBASE SQL Server databases using the DEC ODBC Driver
   for MS Windows. This driver provides access to SQL/Services servers
   over DECnet or TCP/IP network transports. This driver also provides
   these applications with access to DEC Rdb databases, DBI and the other
   DBI gateways.

   Distributed Data Access

   The SYBASE Gateway supports access from remote clients and to remote
   SYBASE SQL Server databases.

   Integration with DEC SQL Applications

   The Sybase Gateway makes data residing in SYBASE SQL Server databases
   accessible to Digital information management and end-user access tools.

   o  DEC Data Distributor can move data between SYBASE SQL Server databases
      and other databases on a common network. SYBASE SQL Server databases
      can be both sources and targets of these transfers. Refer to SPD
      27.26.xx for more information on DEC Data Distributor.

   Version 1.0B for OpenVMS VAX

   o  DATATRIEVE queries, reports, and updates can combine data from SYBASE
      Gateways, other DBI gateways and DEC Rdb databases.

   o  DEC RALLY applications can query and report SYBASE databases.

   Performance

   The SYBASE Gateway selects access strategies that minimize data trans-
   fer activity. Wherever possible, selection, filtering, and statisti-
   cal operations are done by the SYBASE SQL Server. A log of communi-
   cations activity and errors is maintained to assist in problem iso-
   lation and evaluation.

   Optional SQL Support

   Full support for interactive SQL and SQL application development is
   available with the optional purchase of interactive and development
   licenses for DEC SQL, DEC DB Integrator or DEC Rdb.

   Full Interactive SQL Support

   An interactive SQL license extends interactive SQL support to include
   all DEC SQL statements associated with database definition and admin-
   istration tasks.

   A Development license provides precompiler support for embedded SQL
   applications, a compiler for SQL module language programs and an ap-
   plication programming interface (API) to support the development of
   client/server applications.

   Embedded SQL programming places SQL language statements in line with
   host language statements. Precompilers replace these SQL statements
   with call statements and object modules. The modified host language
   program is compiled and linked with the object modules to form an ex-
   ecutable image. Precompilers for DEC C, DEC Ada, DEC COBOL, DEC For-
   tran, DEC Pascal and PL/I for OpenVMS are included.

   DEC DB Integrator Gateway for SYBASE[R]               SPD 47.35.02
   Version 1.0B for OpenVMS VAX

   These precompilers support an optional Federal Information Process-
   ing Standards (FIPS) flagger that allows the user to identify any SQL
   statements which are not in the current ANSI/ISO SQL standard. An ex-
   ception flagger for the Multivendor Integration Architecture (MIA) stan-
   dard is also provided.

   The SQL module language processor included with the development op-
   tion allows SQL statements and multistatement procedures to be grouped
   into modules. When these modules are compiled, the resulting object
   modules can be linked with objects created by any language compiler
   that complies with the OpenVMS calling standard. The SQL module lan-
   guage compiler also supports FIPS and MIA flagging.

   SQL/Services API programming libraries are used to interface client
   applications to the SQL/Services server. MS-DOS[R] or MS Windows client
   applications can be written in Microsoft C. Macintosh[R] client ap-
   plications can be written in MPW[TM] C or ThinkC.

   A SQL Development Option includes SQL/Services client programming li-
   braries for Microsoft Windows, MS-DOS, Sun[R], ULTRIX or OpenVMS plat-
   forms.

   The following table summarizes SQL/Services network support. Clients
   other than the DEC ODBC Driver for MS Windows are based on the SQL/Services
   API.

   Data Dictionary Support

   The SQL INTEGRATE command updates CDD/Repository with definitions ex-
   tracted from SYBASE SQL Server databases.

   The use of CDD/Repository with the SYBASE Gateway encourages consol-
   idated maintenance of data definitions in a repository where they can
   be shared by all applications, databases and programming tools that
   use them.

   CONFORMANCE TO STANDARDS

   When used in conjunction with DEC SQL, the SYBASE gateway complies with
   the International Standard, ISO/IEC 9075:1992, and the American Na-
   tional Standard, ANSI X3.135-1992, Database Language SQL, Entry-Level
   specification and the Federal Information Processing Standard for Database
   Language SQL (FIPS SQL) as defined in FIPS PUB 127-2.

   The DEC ODBC Driver for MS Windows complies with the Microsoft Open
   Database Connectivity specification V1.0. It supports all Core and Level
   1 calls and many, but not all, Level 2 calls.

   be reduced by approximately that (14 MB) amount.

   These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
   sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
   system environment, configuration, and software options selected.

   Additional space must be allowed for programs, logs, and temporary database
   cache files, and user interface software.
