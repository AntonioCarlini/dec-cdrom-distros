   PRODUCT NAME:  DEC DB Integrator Gateway for DB2[TM],  SPD 25.E7.06
                  Version 3.0B, for OpenVMS VAX

   DESCRIPTION

   DEC DB Integrator Gateway for DB2 for OpenVMS VAX (DB2 Gateway) pro-
   vides applications and tools with direct, read/write access to DB2 databases
   residing on IBM[R] MVS/XA and MVS/ESA systems. This access can be via
   interactive or dynamic SQL interfaces. Support for client/server ac-
   cess is provided by the SQL/Services server and the DEC ODBC Driver
   for MS[R] Windows[TM]. Optional support for embedded SQL and SQL mod-
   ule language programming is available. The DB2 Gateway communicates
   with the DB Integrator Gateway for DB2 Server V2.0, which must be in-
   stalled on the IBM system.

   The DB2 Gateway also provides native integration with DEC DB Integra-
   tor (DBI). DBI extends the functionality of the DB2 Gateway by pro-
   viding persistent DBI Catalog storage of the DB2 metadata and the abil-
   ity to do cross-database joins.

   The DB2 Gateway runs under the OpenVMS VAX Operating System on Digital
   VAX, MicroVAX, VAXstation, VAXserver and VAXft systems, servers and
   workstations.

   Features

   Standard DEC SQL Interfaces

   The DB2 Gateway provides direct, read/write access to DB2 databases
   through standard DEC SQL interfaces. These interfaces include a dy-
   namic SQL interface, an interactive SQL facility and the SQL/Services
   server.

                                                           AE-MH79G-TE

 



   DEC DB Integrator Gateway for DB2[TM],                SPD 25.E7.06
   Version 3.0B, for OpenVMS VAX

   SQL data manipulation language (DML) is fully supported. SQL data def-
   inition language (DDL) support is limited to operations required to
   create and maintain domains and tables and to grant and revoke access
   to database objects.

   The dynamic SQL interface compiles and executes SQL requests passed
   through its call interface. This programming approach is highly ef-
   fective in applications such as ad-hoc query where the exact param-
   eters of requests are not known until runtime. It is compatible with
   any programming language that supports the OpenVMS calling standard.
   The dynamic memory handling capabilities of Ada and C enable these lan-
   guages to take full advantage of the power and flexibility of this ap-
   proach.

   The Interactive SQL facility supports interactive query and update of
   DB2 data as well as management of DB2 metadata descriptions for ta-
   bles and domains.

   All data format translations for supported OpenVMS datatypes are per-
   formed automatically as part of handling requests to read and update
   data in DB2 databases. EBCDIC to ASCII translation is table driven and
   may be based on the default table or, where appropriate, on a user-
   defined table.

   Desktop Connectivity

   Microsoft[R] Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) applications can read
   from, and write to, DB2 databases using the DEC ODBC Driver for MS Windows.
   This driver provides access to SQL/Services servers over DECnet or TCP
   /IP network transports. This driver also provides these applications
   with access to DEC Rdb databases, DBI and the other DBI gateways.

   Distributed Data Access

   The DB2 Gateway supports access from remote clients and to remote DB2
   databases.

   Integration with DEC SQL Applications

   The DB2 Gateway makes data residing in DB2 databases accessible to Digital
   information management and end-user access tools.

   o  DEC Data Distributor can move data between DB2 databases and other
      databases on a common network. DB2 databases can be both sources
      and targets of these transfers. Refer to SPD 27.26.xx for more in-
      formation on DEC Data Distributor.

   o  DATATRIEVE queries, reports, and updates can combine data from DB2
      Gateways, other DBI gateways and DEC Rdb databases.

   o  DEC RALLY applications can query and report DB2 databases.

   Security

   The DB2 Gateway Server works in conjunction with existing security prod-
   ucts, such as CA-ACF2, RACF, and default CICS security, in IBM envi-
   ronments.

   -  DB2 Gateway users require an IBM account and must be properly au-
      thorized within CICS and DB2 to access DB2 data.

   -  The DB2 Gateway Client supports the CICS attach time security op-
      tion of ATTACHSEC(IDENTIFY). This is the CICS implementation of the
      LU6.2 already verified security option. This option can provide a
      more secure environment by keeping user passwords out of command
      files and off the network. This option requires an external secu-
      rity manager (RACF, CA-ACF2) capable of supporting this feature within
      CICS.

   Flexible Access

   The DB2 Gateway uses Digital DECnet/SNA interconnect software and hard-
   ware, including the DECnet/SNA gateways, and the DECnet/SNA VMS APPC/LU6.2
   programming interface to link VAX to IBM communication facilities.

   -  Local and remote clients can access any DB2 Gateway server that is
      network accessible.

   -  Servers can be restricted to read-only access to DB2 databases.

   Performance

   The DB2 Gateway selects access strategies that minimize data trans-
   fer activity. Wherever possible, selection, filtering, and statisti-
   cal operations are done by the DB2. A log of communications activity
   and errors is maintained to assist in problem isolation and evalua-
   tion.

   Optional SQL Support

   Full support for interactive SQL and SQL application development is
   available with the optional purchase of interactive and development
   licenses for DEC SQL, DEC DB Integrator or DEC Rdb.

   Full Interactive SQL Support

   An Interactive SQL license extends interactive SQL support to include
   all DEC SQL statements associated with database definition and admin-
   istration tasks.

   A Development license provides precompiler support for embedded SQL
   applications, a compiler for SQL module language programs and an ap-
   plication programming interface (API) to support the development of
   client/server applications.

   Embedded SQL programming places SQL language statements in line with
   host language statements. Precompilers replace these SQL statements
   with call statements and object modules. The modified host language
   program is compiled and linked with the object modules to form an ex-
   ecutable image. Precompilers for DEC C, DEC Ada, DEC COBOL, DEC For-
   tran, DEC Pascal and PL/I for OpenVMS are included.

   These precompilers support an optional Federal Information Process-
   ing Standards (FIPS) flagger that allows the user to identify any SQL
   statements which are not in the current ANSI/ISO SQL standard. An ex-
   ception flagger for the Multivendor Integration Architecture (MIA) stan-
   dard is also provided.

   DEC DB Integrator Gateway for DB2[TM],                SPD 25.E7.06
   Version 3.0B, for OpenVMS VAX

   The SQL module language processor included with the development op-
   tion allows SQL statements and multistatement procedures to be grouped
   into modules. When these modules are compiled, the resulting object
   modules can be linked with objects created by any language compiler
   that complies with the OpenVMS calling standard. The SQL module lan-
   guage compiler also supports FIPS and MIA flagging.

   SQL/Services API programming libraries are used to interface client
   applications to the SQL/Services server. MS-DOS or MS-Windows client
   applications can be written in Microsoft C. Macintosh client appli-
   cations can be written in MPW C or ThinkC.

   The SQL Development Option includes SQL/Services client programming
   libraries for Microsoft[R] Windows[TM], MS-DOS[R], Sun[R], ULTRIX or
   OpenVMS platforms.

   The following table summarizes SQL/Services network support. Clients
   other than the DEC ODBC Driver for MS Windows are based on the SQL/Services
   API.

   Data Dictionary Support

   The SQL INTEGRATE command updates CDD/Repository with definitions ex-
   tracted from DB2 databases. The use of CDD/Repository with the DB2 Gate-
   way encourages consolidated maintenance of data definitions in a repos-
   itory where they can be shared by all applications, databases and pro-
   gramming tools that use them.

   CONFORMANCE TO STANDARDS

   When used in conjunction with DEC SQL, the DB2 gateway complies with
   the International Standard, ISO/IEC 9075:1992, and the American Na-
   tional Standard, ANSI X3.135-1992, Database Language SQL, Entry-Level
   specification and the Federal Information Processing Standard for Database
   Language SQL (FIPS SQL) as defined in FIPS PUB 127-2.

   The DEC ODBC Driver for MS Windows complies with the Microsoft Open
   Database Connectivity specification V1.0. It supports all Core and Level
   1 calls and many, but not all, Level 2 calls.
