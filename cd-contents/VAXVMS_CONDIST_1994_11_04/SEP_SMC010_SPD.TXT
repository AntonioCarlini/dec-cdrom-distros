 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC Storage Monitor for OpenVMS, Version 1.0     SPD
 39.63.00

 DESCRIPTION

 The DEC Storage Monitor is a layered software product that provides
 storage management across both magnetic and optical disk media. Ef-
 ficient file storage and high performance retrieval are features of
 the DEC Storage Monitor.

 The DEC Storage Monitor provides data integrity, shared access, ac-
 cess control, optical media support, and high-speed delivery of data
 to the desktop through the use of magnetic disk caching techniques.

 The DEC Storage Monitor uses a client/server architecture. This ar-
 chitecture is suited for large-scale, high-volume document management
 solutions. A system that uses the DEC Storage Monitor can be scaled
 to serve hundreds of users in a networked, heterogeneous environment.

 The DEC Storage Monitor has the following components:

 o  DEC Storage Monitor Server for OpenVMS[*]

 o  DEC Storage Monitor Client for OpenVMS

 o  DEC Storage Monitor Client for Windows[TM]

 Features

 The DEC Storage Monitor features are described according to the fol-
 lowing:

 Client/Server Architecture

 The DEC Storage Monitor provides the following client/server archi-
 tectural features:

 o  Individual component monitors, servers, managers and their respec-
    tive optical media and magnetic caches can be distributed across
    a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN). This abil-
    ity to distribute components provides a solution capable of serv-
    ing hundreds of concurrent users.

 o  The architecture supports high data rates through distribution and
    parallelism.

 o  Performance can be increased by distributing DEC Storage Monitor
    components across multiple server CPUs.

 o  Requests are processed in a multi-threaded asynchronous environ-
    ment.

 o  The architecture supports, but does not require, optical media.

 Performance

 The DEC Storage Monitor has the following performance features:

 o  The architecture delivers high performance file retrieval through
    network and storage optimization.

                                  2

 

 o  Hashed multiple-volume organization for caches increases total mag-
    netic storage capacity and total disk I/O throughput beyond the lim-
    its of a single disk.

 o  Hashed multiple-directory organization for caches and optical vol-
    umes optimizes directory search performance.

 o  Multiple files may be stored and retrieved concurrently and asyn-
    chronously.

 Application Environment

 The DEC Storage Monitor runs in the following application environments:

 o  A common application programming interface (API) is provided for
    both OpenVMS and Microsoft(R) Windows clients.

 o  The DEC Storage Monitor API is asynchronous and multi-threaded.

 o  DECwindows and Microsoft Windows event processing does not stall
    while the DEC Storage Monitor API processes requests.

 o  Windows events may be used to signal completion of DEC Storage Mon-
    itor requests.

 Optical Media Support (Optional)

 The DEC Storage Monitor provides the following features to support op-
 tical media:

 o  The Client application can specify on which primary volume to store
    a file (within security constraints which a system manager can spec-
    ify). This allows related files to be retrieved with a single juke-
    box operation when those files have been stored on the same opti-
    cal volume.

 o  Files are automatically stored on a primary optical volume and a
    backup optical volume. Backup media, written in journal order, can
    be used to reconstruct damaged primary media. Storage on the backup
    volume can be turned off, if not required.

                                  3

 

 o  For increased performance and data reliability, the DEC Storage Mon-
    itor automatically retrieves files from either the primary or backup
    volume.

 o  Jukeboxes can be located remotely from the applications that ac-
    cess or create the stored files.

 o  Optical media may be accessed immediately upon system startup, even
    though full jukebox initialization may take up to one hour depend-
    ing upon the jukebox hardware and jukebox driver software being used.

 o  One or more jukeboxes can be managed concurrently.

 o  Overflow volumes may be specified in advance and automatically re-
    place optical volumes as they become full.

 Management and Control

 The DEC Storage Monitor provides the following management and control
 features:

 o  DEC Storage Monitor API routines will not execute unless a network
    connection to the server has been established. Client connections
    to servers are granted only if the client application name, user-
    name, and node name match entries in the Storage Monitor database.

 o  Only a subset of the optical volumes may be read or written by each
    application. Application name is specified when the client connects
    to the server. The optical volumes available to each application
    are listed in the Storage Monitor database.

 o  Restrictions to access magnetic caches and optical media are en-
    forced by OpenVMS Access Control Lists (ACLs).

 o  The Storage Monitor database tracks the location and state of op-
    tical media and logical volumes. Media state can be online (in a
    jukebox), offline (onsite and available for operator mount), or off-
    site (offsite location may be noted in the database).

 o  A command line interface for editing the Storage Monitor database
    is provided.

                                  4

 

 o  The operator interface provides a common command line interface that
    manages the way jukeboxes from multiple vendors insert and eject
    optical media.
