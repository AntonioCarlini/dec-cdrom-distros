 PRODUCT NAME:  Digital SNA Data Transfer Facility      SPD 27.85.07
                for OpenVMS, Version 3.2

 This SPD describes Digital SNA Data Transfer Facility for OpenVMS, which
 is available for the OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS AXP platforms. All in-
 formation applies to both platforms unless otherwise indicated.

 DESCRIPTION

 The Digital SNA Data Transfer Facility for OpenVMS (DTF) is a layered
 software product that provides data transfer capabilities between IBM[R]
 MVS systems in a Systems Network Architecture (SNA) environment, and
 Digital nodes in a Digital network. DTF supports the following: Open-
 VMS AXP systems running DECnet for OpenVMS, OpenVMS VAX systems run-
 ning DECnet-VAX, ULTRIX systems running DECnet-ULTRIX, MS-DOS[R] sys-
 tems running PATHWORKS for DOS, and OS/2[R] systems running PATHWORKS
 for OS/2. Access between the cooperating Digital and IBM environments
 is via one of the following products:

 o  Digital SNA Gateway for Synchronous Transport

 o  Digital SNA Gateway for Channel Transport

 o  DEC SNA Domain Gateway for Channel Transport

 o  VMS/SNA - an OpenVMS VAX layered product that supports users on the
    system where VMS/SNA is running

 The following briefly highlights the features of DTF. More detailed
 information is given in the Features section.

 Client/Server-Style Operation

                                                          April 1996

                                                         AE-KL24H-TE

 

 The DTF product provides a client/server style of operation. The Open-
 VMS/DTF server can support file operations between IBM MVS and DEC-
 net OpenVMS, ULTRIX, MS-DOS, and OS/2 clients. No additional software
 besides DECnet software is required on the DECnet clients (except for
 OpenVMS recoverable copy operations). Refer to the Configuration sec-
 tion for more information.

 Highlights

 Ease of Use

 DTF provides a familiar user interface for both Digital and IBM users.
 This feature supports easy application development and reduces staff
 training.

 Comprehensive, Bidirectional Access from All Supported Clients

 The DTF product enables bidirectional file transfer between all DTF-
 supported DECnet nodes and IBM MVS systems.

 Checkpoint and Recovery

 DTF provides OpenVMS and IBM users with checkpoint and recovery sup-
 port in the event of a system or network failure. This feature allows
 DTF to resume an interrupted recoverable copy operation when the net-
 work returns to a normal state. This saves significant time and sys-
 tem resources when large files are transferred.

 File Backup

 DTF allows OpenVMS and ULTRIX users to target IBM disks and tapes for
 backup and restore operations. In large coresident Digital and IBM sites,
 this capability optimizes system resource usage. Users have the abil-
 ity to include an allocation space qualifier when backing up files to
 target IBM disks to ensure proper disk space availability.

 Remote Job Submission

 DTF users can submit jobs remotely from all DECnet clients.

 Post-Processing

                                  2

 

 Using DTF, OpenVMS, and IBM, users can provide a post-processing file
 to be executed after a file transfer is completed. This feature al-
 lows OpenVMS and IBM users to logically connect the running of a batch
 job to the successful completion of a DTF file transfer. This makes
 the implementation of distributed processing functions significantly
 easier to synchronize between IBM applications and DECnet-based ap-
 plications.

 Record-Level Access

 DTF supports record-level access from OpenVMS systems to IBM MVS sys-
 tems.

 Supported File Types

 DTF supports multiple file types (RMS, VSAM, BSAM, and CMS), allow-
 ing easy applications development. DTF also supports mixed case IBM
 file specifications.

 FTAM/OSI Support

 Users in an Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) network can transfer
 files to and from an IBM system by using VAX FTAM in conjunction with
 DTF software. IBM users can also transfer files to and from systems
 in an OSI network by using DTF software and the DAP-FTAM Gateway.

 HSM Support

 DTF supports IBM's Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM) facility.

 IBM Enterprise Architecture and SMS Support

 DTF runs in compliance with IBM's Enterprise Architecture and will sup-
 port SMS-managed data sets (refer to the Supported IBM Configurations
 section).

 Data Translation Using Load Balancing and Performance Tuning



                                  3

 

 DTF supports text translation from DMCS (Digital Multinational Char-
 acter Set, a superset of ASCII) to EBCDIC and vice versa on a record-
 by-record basis. DTF supports load balancing and performance tuning
 between the IBM system and the OpenVMS/DTF server node by allowing users
 to select which system performs the text translation. Enhanced per-
 formance of the OpenVMS/DTF server often results when this transla-
 tion is performed on the IBM system. DTF also supports, through the
 VAX Common Data Dictionary (CDD) product, field-level translation.

 Data Security

 Security is enhanced by the use of proxies. IBM users are not required
 to specify a DECnet password; DTF will initiate the access on the Open-
 VMS systems with a user ID derived from the IBM User ID.

 DTF controls access and protects valuable data with superior security
 capabilities. DTF supports the following industry-standard security
 interfaces that run on IBM machines: RACF, CA-ACF2[TM], SAF, and VMSECURE[TM].

 Server Management

 The DTF product includes a management utility to manage the OpenVMS
 /DTF server.

 Event Logging

 DTF for IBM logs events which can be used for historical inquiry or
 accounting. System programmers can easily write specialized account-
 ing and bill-back reports using DTF's logs.

 Components

 There are three components to the Digital SNA Data Transfer Facility
 for OpenVMS product:

 o  Data Transfer Facility server (OpenVMS/DTF server) software

 o  Data Transfer Facility utilities (OpenVMS/DTF utilities) software

 o  Data Transfer Facility for IBM MVS system (DTF for MVS) software

 OpenVMS/DTF Server Software

                                  4

 

 The OpenVMS/DTF server software can be installed on any OpenVMS AXP
 or OpenVMS VAX system in a DECnet network containing an SNA gateway
 or on any OpenVMS VAX system running VMS/SNA. The node that is run-
 ning the OpenVMS/DTF server software is referred to as the server node.
 All DTF file requests go through this server node which communicates
 with the appropriate DTF for IBM system by using an SNA gateway or by
 using VMS/SNA software. The server software also performs text trans-
 lation (DMCS/EBCDIC). However, this can be done optionally by the DTF
 for IBM software. The VAX Common Data Dictionary product is required
 on the OpenVMS/DTF server node for the translation of data types other
 than DMCS/EBCDIC. The OpenVMS/DTF server software includes the Open-
 VMS/DTF utilities software described in the next section.

 OpenVMS/DTF Utilities Software

 The OpenVMS/DTF utilities software is an optional component that can
 be installed on any OpenVMS system where users wish to transfer files
 using the recoverable copy feature. The utilities software should also
 be installed if IBM users will be requesting recoverable copies in-
 volving that OpenVMS node. The utilities software consists of a server
 management utility and a checkpoint/recovery utility (TRANSFER/DTF).
 The OpenVMS/DTF utilities software communicates with the OpenVMS/DTF
 server software to accomplish the data transfer. It is not necessary
 to install the OpenVMS/DTF utilities software on the server node since
 these utilities are included in the OpenVMS/DTF server software pack-
 age.

 DTF for MVS Software

 The DTF for MVS software can be installed on any IBM S/370-class or
 IBM S/390-class machine system running the MVS Operating System. DTF
 for MVS accepts file operation commands from the OpenVMS/DTF server
 software and maps them into MVS file commands to perform the opera-
 tion. It also provides interfaces so TSO users can issue recoverable
 and non-recoverable copy commands in interactive or batch mode. DTF
 for MVS software consists of two parts: a VTAM[TM] application pro-
 gram that controls the communications with the OpenVMS/DTF server nodes
 for the purpose of transferring files, and user interfaces. The three


                                  5

 

 user interfaces are: a TSO command processor; a single-line command
 interface (REXX required); and an ISPF dialog.

 Configuration

 A DTF for IBM component must be installed on each IBM system with which
 users want to communicate. The DECnet network requires one OpenVMS/DTF
 server component installed on a OpenVMS system, and may require mul-
 tiple server component installations depending on the amount of use
 of DTF. All other nodes in the DECnet network, including OpenVMS, UL-
 TRIX, MS-DOS, OS/2, and RSX, do not require any additional software
 since DTF allows users to use standard DECnet file transfer commands
 to access IBM files. The OpenVMS/DTF utilities software is required
 only if a particular OpenVMS system's users need the recoverable copy
 feature or if IBM users desire recoverable copy operations to that Open-
 VMS system. Recoverable copy works only to OpenVMS nodes with the Open-
 VMS/DTF server software or the OpenVMS/DTF utilities software installed.

 Features

 Ease of Use

 The DTF product uses a variety of familiar user interfaces to make users
 more productive. Users do not have to learn new commands and proce-
 dures.

 Users in the OpenVMS environment can issue standard DCL commands, like
 COPY, TYPE, DIRECTORY, and so on. Alternatively, they can use the Record
 Management System (RMS) programming interface or the TRANSFER/DTF util-
 ity for data exchange between DECnet and IBM systems.

 IBM MVS users can access and transfer data by using the TSO DTF com-
 mand processor, the TSO ISPF panels, or the single-line interface. IBM
 VM users can use the CMS DTF command processor, the CMS ISPF panels
 or the single-line interface. The TSO and CMS command processors can
 also be invoked in batch mode.




                                  6

 

 ULTRIX users access files by using the standard DECnet-ULTRIX file trans-
 fer commands. MS-DOS and OS/2 users simply issue the standard PATH-
 WORKS for DOS or PATHWORKS for OS/2 NFT commands.

 DTF Access from OpenVMS Clients

 OpenVMS DTF users can initiate non-recoverable or recoverable, bidi-
 rectional file transfers between IBM DTF clients and themselves. DTF
 supports the following OpenVMS DCL commands.

 Note: Some of the qualifiers associated with these DCL commands are sub-
 ject to restrictions when used with DTF.

 APPEND      DELETE       SEARCH

 BACKUP      DIFFERENCES  REMOTE
             SUBMIT

 CLOSE       DIRECTORY    TYPE

 CONVERT     EXCHANGE     WRITE
             /NETWORK

 COPY        OPEN

 CREATE      READ

 DTF Access from MS-DOS and OS/2 Clients

 MS-DOS and OS/2 DTF users can initiate non-recoverable, bidirectional
 file transfers between IBM DTF clients and themselves. IBM-initiated
 file transfers are supported by MS-DOS and OS/2 systems when the PATH-
 WORKS for DOS or PATHWORKS for OS/2 File Access Listener (FAL) is run-
 ning. DTF supports the following PATHWORKS for DOS and PATHWORKS for
 OS/2 NFT commands.

 Note: Some of these commands are subject to restrictions when used with
 DTF.

 APPEND      DELETE       SUBMIT

 COPY        DIRECTORY    TYPE

 DTF Access from ULTRIX Clients

                                  7

 

 ULTRIX DTF users can initiate non-recoverable, bidirectional file trans-
 fers between DTF for IBM systems and themselves. DTF supports the fol-
 lowing DECnet-ULTRIX commands.

 Note: Some of these commands are subject to restrictions when used with
 DTF.

 DTF Access from IBM Clients

 IBM DTF users can initiate non-recoverable or recoverable, bidirec-
 tional file transfers between OpenVMS DTF clients running the Open-
 VMS/DTF utilities software and themselves. In addition, they can ini-
 tiate non-recoverable, bidirectional file transfer between all other
 DTF clients (including other IBM systems) and themselves. MVS TSO users
 have the following commands available to transfer files to or from other
 DTF clients.

 Checkpoint and Recovery

 Checkpoint and recovery capabilities assure that data remains accu-
 rate and intact, even in the event of system or network failure. When
 OpenVMS users transfer files using the TRANSFER/DTF utility, it au-
 tomatically resumes an interrupted file transfer process with no loss
 of data when communications between sending and receiving systems is
 re-established. Checkpoint and recovery is supported for non-VSAM and
 CMS files that are disk- or tape-resident. Checkpoint and recovery is
 not supported on VSAM files.

 IBM users have a similar checkpoint and recovery feature. A recover-
 able copy operation performed from an IBM system sets environment vari-
 ables (CLIST in MVS). If the transfer terminates with a network er-
 ror, these variables contain information to allow the user to resume
 the transfer.

                                  8

 

 File Backup

 DTF allows OpenVMS users to back up and restore their disks directly
 to IBM tapes or disks using the OpenVMS BACKUP command. ULTRIX users
 can also back up and restore disks to IBM tapes or disks. Users have
 the ability to include an allocation space qualifier when backing up
 files to target IBM disks to insure proper disk space availability.

 Remote Job Submission

 OpenVMS, ULTRIX, DOS, and OS/2 users can submit JCL files on the IBM
 system to be executed by JES or by a batch machine. These users can
 use the standard DECnet file operation commands to initiate the job
 submission. For example, OpenVMS users use SUBMIT/REMOTE and ULTRIX
 users use dcp -S. Users will not get the status of the job completion.
 IBM DTF users can submit jobs by using the post-processing feature de-
 scribed in the next section.

 Post-Processing

 Post-processing is the ability to submit a DCL command procedure or
 MVS JCL procedure after a file transfer is completed. IBM users can
 use the post-processing feature from either the command processor or
 the panel interface. OpenVMS users can use the post-processing fea-
 ture only through the TRANSFER/DTF utility.

 Record-Level Access

 DTF allows an OpenVMS user record-level access to IBM files by means
 of an RMS application, DCL commands, or DATATRIEVE. DTF does not sup-
 port record-level access initiated from IBM to OpenVMS RMS files.

 Supported File Types

 All OpenVMS file types and ULTRIX, MS-DOS, and OS/2 stream files are
 supported. MS-DOS and OS/2 support only stream files. Therefore, all
 files copied to MS-DOS or OS/2 systems result in stream files. All files
 copied from MS-DOS and OS/2 systems result in sequential data sets on
 IBM systems.

                                  9

 

 For IBM MVS systems, supported non-VSAM file types are those with the
 physical sequential data set organization. This includes normal se-
 quential files as well as partitioned data set members. Both disk-resident
 and tape-resident non-VSAM files are supported. Supported VSAM file
 types include entry-sequenced data sets (ESDS), relative-record data
 sets (RRDS), and key-sequenced data sets (KSDS).

 DTF provides an option for users to overcome the null record restric-
 tion by substituting a record containing a character or value chosen
 by the user. A mixed case option supports applications on the IBM side
 that create file specifications that are case sensitive. The case qual-
 ifier supports file specifications that contain lower case characters.

 FTAM/OSI Support

 Users in an OSI network can transfer files defined by FTAM/OSI stan-
 dard file types to IBM MVS using VAX FTAM and DTF software. IBM TSO
 or CMS users can also transfer files to and from systems in an OSI net-
 work using DTF and DAP-FTAM Gateway software. For more information on
 VAX FTAM and DAP-FTAM Gateway software refer to the VAX FTAM Software
 Product Description (SPD 29.86.xx).

 OpenVMS users will access the VAX FTAM user facilities to perform FTAM
 tasks. Users on other operating systems will use an initiator on their
 systems to access VAX FTAM on OpenVMS through the VAX FTAM responder.
 The VAX FTAM responder then, in turn, accesses DTF to perform the tasks
 on the IBM system.

 VAX FTAM users can initiate non-recoverable, bidirectional file trans-
 fer between IBM clients and either themselves or remote OSI FTAM re-
 sponders.

 DTF supports the following OpenVMS FTAM DCL commands.

 Note: Some of the qualifiers associated with these DCL commands are sub-
 ject to restrictions when used with DTF.

 APPEND      COPY         DELETE       DIRECTORY


                                 10

 

 DTF supports the following FTAM document type files:

 o  FTAM-2 String Significant of None

 o  FTAM-1 String Significant of Fixed

 The following FTAM document type files are supported with these re-
 strictions:

 o  FTAM-1 String Significance of Variable. Files can be copied to the
    IBM system but will lose the FTAM-1 file type definition. The file
    is translated as an FTAM-2 NOT significant file when the file is
    pulled back. File contents are not altered.

 o  FTAM-3 String Significance of Fixed. Files can be copied to the IBM
    system but will lose the attributes when the file is pulled back.
    The FTAM-3 file type changes to an FTAM-1 String Significance of
    FIXED when the file is pulled back. File contents are not altered.

 DTF does not support any other FTAM document type files or NBS-9 di-
 rectories.

 HSM Support

 DTF for MVS supports the Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM) facil-
 ity and allows users to recall migrated data sets. IBM system program-
 mers can tailor the number of concurrent outstanding HSM requests as
 well as device recall capability.

 SMS Support

 DTF for MVS supports the MVS Storage Management Subsystem (SMS) fa-
 cility.

 Data Translation

 DTF provides three options for data translation: no data translation
 at all, DMCS (Digital Multinational Character Set, a superset of ASCII)
 to EBCDIC and vice versa, and field-level translation.

                                 11

 

 o  Users can specify that DTF should perform no data translation dur-
    ing a file transfer. This option is useful for transferring image
    files.

 o  By default, DTF performs data translation from DMCS to EBCDIC and
    vice versa on a record-by-record basis. This is the option normally
    used to transfer text files.

 o  Users can specify that DTF use alternate field-level translation.
    In this case, the OpenVMS/DTF server software translates data types
    such as binary, integer, floating point, packed decimal, and nu-
    meric strings using VAX Common Data Dictionary (CDD/Plus) record
    definitions supplied by the user. The semantics of data in the file
    is maintained across a file transfer. The CDD/Plus product is re-
    quired on the OpenVMS/DTF server node for alternate field-level data
    translation.

 By default, data translation is performed on the OpenVMS/DTF server
 node. To decrease the load on the OpenVMS/DTF server, the server man-
 ager can optionally specify that data translation (DMCS/EBCDIC) oc-
 cur on the IBM DTF client.

 Data Security

 Files on the IBM system are accessible only to Digital users who know
 the valid access control information. DTF for IBM provides interfaces
 into the CA-ACF2, RACF, and VMSECURE security systems and a standard
 user exit for other security mechanisms (such as CA-TOPSECRET[TM]) through
 the System Authorization Facility (SAF) interface. For Digital sys-
 tems, security is maintained by using the standard file protection mech-
 anism provided by the base operating system.

 DTF also allows DECnet style proxy information to be stored on the IBM
 system using standard IBM system security packages (CA-ACF2, RACF).

 For ease of use, DTF for IBM allows users to perform file transfers
 without having to provide passwords for their files located on their
 own IBM system.

 Server Management

                                 12

 

 DTF for OpenVMS provides a management utility to manage the server ac-
 count database, the file definition database, and the DTF proxy databases
 on the OpenVMS/DTF server. The server account database allows the server
 to support file transfer requests to many different IBM DTF clients.
 The file definition database allows users to store the IBM file spec-
 ifications for frequently accessed files. The proxy database allows
 the server manager to set up mappings that allow users to enter re-
 quests without specifying their IBM passwords. Refer to the Data Se-
 curity section for more information.

 Event Logging

 DTF for IBM logs events which can be used for historical inquiry or
 for accounting usage. Historical logging can be used to characterize
 the use of DTF for IBM. Such information is necessary for decisions
 involving operating hours, performance tuning, and load analysis of
 the network and operating system. Account logging allows users of DTF
 for IBM functions to be recorded along with the resources they con-
 sume. The granularity of the information is sufficient to provide a
 bill-back capability. Implementation of the accounting and billing ca-
 pability is handled with a user exit and can be customized on a per-
 site basis.
