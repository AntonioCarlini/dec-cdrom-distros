 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC IEZ11 Class Driver for OpenVMS[1], Version 2.1 SPD
 31.41.04

 DESCRIPTION

 The DEC IEZ11 Class Driver is an OpenVMS layered product that is part
 of the IEZ11 option. The IEZ11 option includes the SCSI488/D bus con-
 verter and the IEZ11 software.

 The DEC IEZ11 Class Driver allows an application written in a higher-
 level language or in Macro 32 to monitor, control, and interface with
 IEEE488 devices using OpenVMS QIO system calls. The driver adheres to
 the OpenVMS SCSI device architecture.

 The DEC IEZ11 Class Driver supports most functions of the IEx11 driver.
 The majority of IEx11 applications can be converted to run on the IEZ11
 with only minor modifications.

 Installation Test and Demo Software (ITADS) is included in the soft-
 ware kit. It provides a means of verifying that the IEZ11 hardware and
 software are functioning properly and can be used as an application
 development and debug tool. Also included is the IEZ11 Exerciser Soft-
 ware, which is a DECwindows/Motif[R] application for the execution of
 IEZ11 functions; it can be used to build small test and debugging scripts.

 The SCSI488/D bus converter is an external box that provides the ca-
 pability of connecting an IEEE488 bus to the SCSI bus of a VAXstation
 or a MicroVAX. The SCSI488/D bus converter, software, and license are
 ordered under a single part number.

 The   terms OpenVMS and VMS refer to the OpenVMS operating system.

 The maximum number of SCSI488/D bus converters that can be supported
 on a single SCSI bus is 6. This number is reduced by 1 for every I/O
 unit that resides on the SCSI bus. For example, on a VAXstation 3100
 with dual RZ23s, one TK50, and one RD40, two IEZ11s could be supported.
 As with all SCSI buses, other factors, including cable length and qual-
 ity, can affect the actual number of SCSI devices that can be supported.

 The IEZ11 is supported under the DEC Realtime Integrator (DECrti), which
 is an icon-based graphical programming environment available on VAX
 and RISC platforms. Instead of using a conventional programming lan-
 guage, the DEC Realtime Integrator allows scientists and engineers to
 create and run real-time applications by drawing them graphically as
 flow diagrams.
