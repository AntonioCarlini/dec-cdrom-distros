PRODUCT NAME:  Digital Device Access Software          SPD 55.51.00
               for MODICON Version 1.0

DESCRIPTION

The Digital Device Access Software (DAS) for MODICON allows users to
access MODICON Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) through 
BASEstar Open[1] Device Services, BASEstar Open Data Services or 
DEComni[1] Services.

Via BASEstar Open Device Services the user may configure device and
variable definitions, read and write variable values and configure for
polled data collection.

BASEstar Open Data Services provide device independant access to shop
floor data allowing the user to configure data points, read and write
data point values and generate events based on data changes.

Users can also perform a variety of device access functions for 
MODICON PLCs using the MODICON DAS by interfacing directly to DEComni APIs.

The Digital DAS for MODICON supports the following MODICON PLCs:

o  Modicon Micro 84

o  Modicon 184, 384, 484, 584M, 584L, 884,
   984X, 984A, 984B

The MODBUS[2] protocol is supported on both OSF/1 AXP and OpenVMS VAX
platforms whilst MODBUS PLUS[2] support is limited to the OpenVMS VAX
platform.
