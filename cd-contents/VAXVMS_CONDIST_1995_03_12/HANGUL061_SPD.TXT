              Version 6.1



DESCRIPTION

OpenVMS/Hangul VAX V6.1 is the Korean (Hangul) version of the OpenVMS VAX
V6.1 operating system. OpenVMS/Hangul VAX extends OpenVMS VAX to provide
an operating system environment to support Korean and ASCII characters on
VAX series computers. On top of the basic functions of OpenVMS VAX, 
OpenVMS/Hangul VAX extends and enhances the system  utilities and
environment to process Korean data.

OpenVMS/Hangul VAX supports Korean data representation that conforms to
the Korean Industrial Standard (KS C 5601-1987), Code for Information
Interchange of the Republic of Korea.

This SPD describes only the Korean specific features of OpenVMS/Hangul
VAX which are extensions or additions to OpenVMS VAX. For a description
of the base functionality and supported environment of OpenVMS VAX,
please refer to OpenVMS VAX V6.1 SPD (SPD 25.01.xx).

Utilities

OpenVMS/Hangul VAX provides the following utilities to support Korean
processing in addition to the OpenVMS VAX utilities:


Hdump

HDUMP enhances DUMP utility to display contents of files or volumes
containing both Korean and ASCII characters. Wrapping of Korean
characters at field boundary is handled correctly.


Hedt

HEDT is an interactive Korean text editor, providing many text processing
enhancements to EDT. The following features are provided in addition to
the EDT functions:

  Full DEC Hangul Character Set Support:
   - Full form and half form character conversion
   - Character code input in hexadecimal, octal and Quwei codes

  Korean Text Processing Functions:
   - Automatic horizontal scrolling
   - Column select for cut and paste
   - ASCII/Korean word wrapping
   - Left/center/right justification
   - Set left and right margins
   - Line drawing/table filling
   - Korean date/time
   - Cursor line/column display
   - Editing modes:
     *  absolute insert
     *  absolute overwrite
     *  insert within fixed ruler lines
     *  overwrite within fixed ruler lines


Hmail

HMAIL extends the OpenVMS MAIL utility to support Korean in subjects,
personal names and folder names. Folders can be displayed according to
specified Korean collating sequences. In addition, it supports operations
which involve  searching of strings that contain Korean characters. HMAIL
invokes HTPU as the default editor.


Htpu and heve

HTPU is the Korean extended version of the DEC Text Processing Utility
(DECTPU) providing built-in procedures with enhancement on Korean text
processing. Additional Korean features are:
  Full form and half form character conversion
  Character class classification
  Line drawing capability
  2-byte symbol composition
  2-byte Korean character deletion and cursor movement
  2-byte Korean character wrapping
  Pattern matching including 2-byte Korean characters

(EVE) running on HTPU providing a general-purpose Korean screen editor to
process  Korean and ASCII characters. Extended commands which include
features such as  Korean word manipulation, line drawing, box drawing and
column editing capabilities are available.


Korean SEARCH

The Korean SEARCH utility is an extended version of the SEARCH utility to
support Korean characters in search strings.


Terminal Fallback Facility

The Terminal Fallback Facility (TFF) is extended to  support character
conversions on Hangul terminals which can only display the DOOSAN
Character Set (DOOSAN 2-byte code). It allows these Hangul terminals to
input and output Korean characters (Hanja is not supported) in the KS C
5601-1987 Character Set by converting characters going to and from the
terminal. This character conversion is  performed through a character
table transparent to application software.


Programming Run-Time Library

OpenVMS/Hangul VAX provides the following run-time library to facilitate
development of Korean applications:


Korean Processing Run-time Library

OpenVMS/Hangul VAX provides a Korean Processing Run-Time Library for
program and  application development involving Korean processing. The
Run-Time Library  routines perform a variety of Korean processing
functions such as string manipulation, read/write operations, character
conversion and other Korean  processing operations. These routines can be
called from programs written in  the VAX programming languages listed
below.


Korean Screen Management Facility (SMG)

Korean SMG provides a set of run-time library routines to perform
terminal independent functions on supported Korean terminals.  Both
Hangul and Hanja are supported in Korean SMG.


Language Support

The following VAX language compilers support Korean data input,
output and manipulation under OpenVMS/Hangul VAX:
  VAX MACRO
  VAX BASIC
  VAX BLISS-32
  VAX C
  VAX COBOL
  VAX FORTRAN
  VAX PASCAL
