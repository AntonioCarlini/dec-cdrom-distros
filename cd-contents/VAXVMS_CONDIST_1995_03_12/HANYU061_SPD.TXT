PRODUCT NAME: OpenVMS/Hanyu VAX Operating System,       SPD 25.G7.13
              Version 6.1



DESCRIPTION

OpenVMS/Hanyu VAX V6.1 is the Chinese (Hanyu) version of the OpenVMS VAX
V6.1 operating system. OpenVMS/Hanyu VAX extends the OpenVMS VAX to
provide an operating system environment to support Chinese and ASCII
characters on VAX series computers. On top of the basic functions of
OpenVMS VAX, OpenVMS/Hanyu VAX extends and enhances the system  utilities
and environment to process Chinese data.

OpenVMS/Hanyu VAX supports Chinese data representation that conforms to
the National Bureau of Standards CNS11643, the Standard Interchange Code
for  Generally-used Chinese Characters (SICGCC, 1986) of Taiwan. The EDPC
Recommended Character Set defined by Electronic Data Processing Center of
Executive Yuan of Taiwan is also supported as a standard option.

This SPD describes only the Chinese specific features of OpenVMS/Hanyu
VAX which are extensions or additions to OpenVMS VAX. For a description
of the base functionality and supported environment of OpenVMS VAX,
please refer to OpenVMS VAX V6.1 SPD (SPD 25.01.xx).


FEATURES

OpenVMS/Hanyu VAX provides the following Chinese processing features
in addition to  the base functionality of OpenVMS VAX.


User Environment

following:

  Chinese in passing parameters
  Chinese equivalence names
  Chinese labels in GOTO and GOSUB statements
  Chinese in SUBROUTINE names and in CALL statements
  Chinese in INQUIRE statements
  Chinese in READ/WRITE statements
  Chinese in MESSAGE/REPLY commands

to receive system messages in either Chinese or English.


Utilities

OpenVMS/Hanyu VAX provides the following utilities to support Chinese
processing in addition to OpenVMS VAX utilities:


Hdump

HDUMP enhances DUMP utility to display contents of files or volumes
containing both Chinese and ASCII characters. Wrapping of Chinese
characters at field boundary is handled correctly.


Hedt

HEDT is an interactive Chinese text editor, providing many processing
enhancements to EDT. The following features are provided in addition to
EDT functions:

  Full DEC Hanyu Character Set Support:
   - Full form and half form character conversion
   - Character code input in hexadecimal, octal and internal codes

  Chinese Text Processing Functions:
   - Automatic horizontal scrolling
   - Column select for cut and paste
   - ASCII/Chinese word wrapping
   - Left/center/right justification
   - Set left and right margins
   - Line drawing/table filling
   - Chinese date/time
   - Cursor line/column display
   - Editing modes:
     *  absolute insert
     *  absolute overwrite
     *  insert within fixed ruler lines
     *  overwrite within fixed ruler lines


Hmail

HMAIL extends OpenVMS MAIL utility to support Chinese in subjects,
personal names and folder names. Folders can be displayed according to
specified Chinese collating sequences. In addition, it supports
operations which involve  searching of strings that contain Chinese
characters. HMAIL invokes HTPU as the default editor.


Sort/Merge

SORT/MERGE utility in OpenVMS/Hanyu VAX has been extended to handle
Chinese data.  The following Chinese collating sequences are supported in
SORT/MERGE:

  Radical
  Number of strokes
  Phonetic code
  Internal code

Both ascending and descending order of sorting are supported.

Multiple collating sequences can be specified for the same sort key in a
single sort.

I/O interfaces, namely file interface and record interface, on the above
Chinese collating sequences are supported.

OpenVMS/Hanyu VAX also supports the HSORT/HMERGE utility, which provides
the same features as SORT/MERGE.


Chinese Search

The Chinese SEARCH utility is an extended version of the SEARCH utility
to support Chinese characters in search strings.


Character ManaGeR (CMGR)

CMGR in OpenVMS/Hanyu VAX provides a font editor and a set of commands to
facilitate creation of user-defined character fonts. Collating value can
also be associated with the user-defined characters for sorting.


Htpu and Heve

HTPU is the Chinese extended version of the DEC Text Processing Utility
(DECTPU) providing built-in procedures with enhancement on Chinese text
processing. Additional Chinese features are:

  Full form and half form character conversion
  Character class classification
  Line drawing capability
  Symbol composition
  Chinese character deletion and cursor movement
  Chinese character wrapping
  Pattern matching including Chinese characters

HEVE is the Chinese extended version of the Extensible Versatile Editor
(EVE) running on HTPU providing a general-purpose Chinese screen editor
to process  Chinese and ASCII characters. Extended commands which include
features such as  Chinese word manipulation, line drawing, box drawing
and column editing capabilities are available.


Phrase Input Utility

The Phrase Input Utility facilitates creation and maintenance of
user-defined database for frequently used phrases and input sequences for
those phrases.  Input of these phrases can then be done using the defined
input sequence on supported terminals which provide this facility.


Terminal Fallback Facility

The Terminal Fallback Facility (TFF) in OpenVMS/Hanyu VAX is extended to 
support character conversions on terminals which can only display the 
following character sets:

  MITAC Telex Code
  BIG 5

It allows these terminals to input and output Chinese characters in the
SICGCC (1986) Character Set by converting characters going to and from
the terminal.


Programming Run-Time Library

OpenVMS/Hanyu VAX provides the following run-time library to facilitate
development of Chinese applications:


Chinese Processing Run-time Library

OpenVMS/Hanyu VAX provides a Chinese Processing Run-Time Library for
program and  application development involving Chinese processing. The
Run-Time Library  routines perform a variety of Chinese processing
functions such as string manipulation, read/write operations, character
conversion and other Chinese  processing operations. These routines can
be called from programs written in  the VAX programming languages listed
below.


Chinese Screen Management Facility (SMG)

Chinese SMG provides a set of run-time library routines to perform
terminal independent functions on supported Chinese terminals. Input and
output of characters in the DEC Hanyu character set can be handled by
calling these routines.


Language Support

The following VAX language compilers support Chinese data input,
output and manipulation under OpenVMS/Hanyu VAX:

  VAX MACRO
  VAX BASIC
  VAX BLISS-32
  VAX C
