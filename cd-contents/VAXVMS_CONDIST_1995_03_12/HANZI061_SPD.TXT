PRODUCT NAME: OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX Operating System,       SPD 25.G6.13
              Version 6.1



 DESCRIPTION

 OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX V6.1 is the Simplified Chinese (Hanzi) version of the
 OpenVMS VAX V6.1 operating system. OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX extends  OpenVMS VAX
 to provide an operating system environment to support Chinese and ASCII
 characters on VAX series computers. On top of the basic functions of
 OpenVMS VAX, OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX extends and enhances the system  utilities
 and environment to process Chinese data.  Utilities are provided to
 facilitate the design and maintenance of user-defined characters.  Output
 of user-defined characters is supported on DEC Hanzi terminals and
 printers via On-Demand Loading, a dynamic font loading feature.

 OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX supports Simplified Chinese data representation that
 conforms to the Primary Set of National Standard Code of Chinese Graphic
 Character Set for Information Interchange (GB2312-80) of the People's
 Republic of China. In addition, OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX supports an extension 
 area of 8,836 character positions in the form of user-defined characters.

 This SPD describes only the Chinese specific features of OpenVMS/Hanzi
 VAX which are extensions or additions to OpenVMS VAX. For a description
 of the base functionality and supported environment of OpenVMS VAX,
 please refer to OpenVMS VAX V6.1 SPD (SPD 25.01.xx).

 Hmail

 HMAIL extends the OpenVMS MAIL utility to support Chinese in subjects,
 personal names and folder names. Folders can be displayed according to
 specified Chinese collating sequences. In addition, it supports
 operations which involve  searching of strings that contain Chinese
 characters. HMAIL invokes HTPU as the default editor.


 Sort/Merge

 SORT/MERGE utility in OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX is extended to handle Chinese
 data.  The following Chinese collating sequences are supported in
 SORT/MERGE:

  Radical
  Number of strokes
