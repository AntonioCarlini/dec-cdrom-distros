 PRODUCT NAME:  DECwindows DECnet SNA 3270 Terminal     SPD 31.58.02
                Emulator for OpenVMS, Version 2.0

 This SPD describes DECwindows DECnet SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator for
 OpenVMS, which is available for the OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS AXP plat-
 forms. All information applies to both platforms unless otherwise in-
 dicated.

 DESCRIPTION

 The DECwindows DECnet SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator for OpenVMS (DECwin-
 dows TE) is a software product that allows users of supported, OpenVMS-
 based Digital workstations and servers and X terminals in a DECnet net-
 work to access and use applications running on an IBM[R] mainframe.

 DECwindows TE also provides access to IBM applications for PCs and Ap-
 ple[R] Macintosh[R] users running on Digital's PATHWORKS network op-
 erating system.

 The product runs in the DECwindows Motif[R] environment. Access to the
 IBM host-based applications system from OpenVMS systems is via one of
 the following products:

 o  DECnet SNA Gateway for Synchronous Transport

 o  DECnet SNA Gateway for Channel Transport

 o  DEC SNA Domain Gateway for Channel Transport

                               DIGITAL                   August 1993

                                                         AE-NJ69C-TE

 

 o  VMS/SNA - an OpenVMS VAX layered product that supports users on the
    system where VMS/SNA is running

 Use of DECwindows TE is supported on the following systems and envi-
 ronments:

 o  Digital Workstations/Servers (VAX and AXP)

 o  Digital X-Terminal Product Set (VXT1XXX and VXT2XXX)

 o  PCs and Macintosh(s) within a Digital PATHWORKS network environ-
    ment

 Communicating Between IBM and Digital Systems

 In normal operation, IBM systems transfer a formatted screen much like
 a "form" or "panel" to the IBM 3270 block mode terminal. Terminal users
 fill in required data and the 3270 terminal transmits the completed
 form to the IBM host as a single unit. In contrast to this "block-mode"
 approach, Digital terminals and workstations send data to OpenVMS or
 ULTRIX host systems one character at a time. Using the DECwindows TE
 enables Digital's character-mode terminals to emulate IBM's block-mode
 style of computing by buffering outbound IBM data in the DECnet host
 system's memory before displaying it, as a single block, on the Dig-
 ital terminal. The Digital terminal then transmits the screen form to
 the IBM host system via an SNA gateway or VMS/SNA.

 Translating ASCII and EBCDIC Data

 Digital systems use ASCII code to represent data, while IBM systems
 use EBCDIC. DECwindows TE contains built-in translation tables that
 convert ISO Latin character input (given in ASCII code) to IBM multi-
 national EBCDIC code for transfer through the SNA gateway or VMS/SNA.
 Users of DECwindows TE can modify these translation tables to fit most
 language needs.

 Starting the DECwindows TE

 Users can invoke the DECwindows TE from the OpenVMS command line or
 choose a custom menu selection on FileView or Session Manager.

                                  2

 

 Users invoking DECwindows TE from an OpenVMS command line use the SNATERM
 command, along with DECwindows qualifiers to specify the IBM system
 and system resources to which they want to connect. While the DECwin-
 dows TE utility is running, its display window is formatted in the same
 style as a 3270 display station with the option of 3270, 3279-S3G, or
 3192-G terminal types. Exiting DECwindows TE returns control to the
 OpenVMS Operating System.

    plication programming interface (API).

 o  Copy and Paste support of text within the current DECwindows ses-
    sion and to and from other DECwindows applications

 HELP Feature

 A readily available online HELP facility provides information on key
 functions. The operator information area as implemented on an actual
 3270 display is not supported. However, much of the same information
 is reported by means of status indicators where the status line is dis-
 played. In addition, the user has the ability to redefine certain IBM
 key functions to different keys of the workstation keyboard.

 SOURCE CODE INFORMATION

 Sources of message files are only available for translation to lan-
 guages other than English. Source code will not be distributed for gen-
 eral purposes.

 INSTALLATION

 Only experienced customers should attempt installation of this prod-
 uct. Digital recommends that all other customers purchase Digital's
 Installation Services. These services provide for installation of the
 software product by an experienced Digital Software Specialist.

 Customer Responsibilities

 Before Digital installation of the software the customer must have:

 o  Previously installed all requisite hardware including terminals and
    the SNA gateway or VMS/SNA;

 o  Obtained, installed, and demonstrated as operational any modems and
    other equipment and facilities necessary to interface to Digital's
    communications equipment;

 o  Generated, to Digital's satisfaction, any necessary IBM host soft-
    ware that will be communicating with the SNA gateway or VMS/SNA and
    DECwindows TE;

 o  Made available for a reasonable period of time, as mutually agreed
    by Digital and the customer, all hardware, communications facil-
    ities, and terminals that are to be used during installation.

                                  8

 

 Delays caused by any failure to meet these responsibilities will be
 charged at the prevailing rate for time and materials.

 Successful use of this product requires that:

 o  the customer be prepared to work with both Digital and IBM systems
    personnel to coordinate the preinstallation activities;

 o  the customer be capable of modifying IBM component generation pa-
    rameters to support either the SNA gateway or VMS/SNA, or the DECwin-
    dows TE software.

 PREREQUISITE SUPPORT

 A Network Profile and a DECnet Customer Support Plan (where appropri-
 ate) covering all OpenVMS nodes that wish to access the IBM host-based
 applications environment must be prepared jointly by Digital and the
 customer.

 For DECwindows DECnet SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator for OpenVMS to be Dig-
 ital supported, the customer must have a Digital supported SNA gate-
 way or VMS/SNA configuration.

 To have a Digital supported SNA gateway configuration, purchase of the
 Transport Installation/Orientation Service (QSF0x-SZ) is REQUIRED in
 conjunction with the customer's first purchase of the SNA Gateway or
 VMS/SNA.
