 PRODUCT NAME:  DECnet SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator       SPD 26.84.07
                for OpenVMS, Version 1.5

 This SPD describes DECnet SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator for OpenVMS, which
 is available for the OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS AXP platforms. All in-
 formation applies to both platforms unless otherwise indicated.

 DESCRIPTION

 The DECnet SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator for OpenVMS (3270 TE) is a lay-
 ered software product that allows users of a VTxxx terminal (or other
 Digital terminal or personal computer in VT100, VT200 or VT300 mode)
 on suitably configured OpenVMS systems within a DECnet network to in-
 teractively access IBM[R] host-based applications. These applications
 have been originally developed for IBM 3270 display stations in a Sys-
 tems Network Architecture (SNA) networking environment. Access to the
 IBM host-based applications system from OpenVMS systems is via one of
 the following products:

 o  DECnet SNA Gateway for Synchronous Transport

 o  DECnet SNA Gateway for Channel Transport

 o  DEC SNA Domain Gateway for Channel Transport

 o  VMS/SNA - an OpenVMS VAX layered product that supports users on the
    system where VMS/SNA is running

 In normal operation, an IBM system transfers a formatted screen, much
 like a "form", to the 3270 block mode terminal and the user fills in
 any data required by the "form". When complete, the form is transmit-
 ted to the IBM host as a single unit. This mechanism is emulated with
 a Digital character mode terminal by buffering the "form" in the DEC-
 net host's memory and displaying it on the terminal. When the screen

                               DIGITAL                   August 1993

                                                         AE-EX18H-TE

 

 "form" is complete, it is sent to the IBM host system via the SNA gate-
 way or VMS/SNA product.

 Translation tables on the respective systems convert ASCII terminal
 input (either Digital Multinational Character Set or National Replace-
 ment Character Set) to a subset of IBM multinational EBCDIC code for
 transfer through either the SNA gateway or VMS/SNA product. These trans-
 lation tables may be modified to fit non-standard character sets.

 Users invoke the 3270 utility using the local OpenVMS system's com-
 mand language, including qualifiers to specify the target IBM system
 and system resources. While the emulation utility is operating, the
 terminal screen is formatted like a 3270 display. When the user has
 finished work on the IBM system, the 3270 emulator is dismissed and
 the terminal is "restored" as an OpenVMS command terminal.

 The 3270 Terminal Emulator supports emulation of the following fea-
 tures of an IBM 3270 Display Station when attached to an IBM 3274 1C

 This product has been designed such that it can be used with most IBM
 applications, however, those applications written using features not
 supported by the emulator (e.g. 3270 Extended Data Stream) must be mod-
 ified.

 A readily available on-line HELP facility provides information on keys
 with altered 3270-oriented functions. The status line as implemented
 on an actual 3270 display is not supported, however much of the same

                                  5

 

 information is reported on a special status line which may be over-
 laid on the VT200's 24th line. In addition, the OpenVMS system man-
 ager has the ability to re-map certain IBM key functions onto differ-
 ent locations on the Digital keyboard.

 PREREQUISITE SUPPORT

 A Network Profile and a DECnet Customer Support Plan (where appropri-
 ate) covering all OpenVMS nodes that wish to access the IBM host based
 applications environment must be prepared jointly by Digital and the
 customer.

 For DECnet SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator for OpenVMS to be Digital sup-
 ported, the customer must have a Digital supported SNA gateway or VMS
 /SNA configuration.

 To have a Digital supported SNA gateway or VMS/SNA configuration, pur-
 chase of the Transport Orientation/Installation Service (QSF0x-SZ) is
 REQUIRED in conjunction with the customer's first purchase of the gate-
 way.
