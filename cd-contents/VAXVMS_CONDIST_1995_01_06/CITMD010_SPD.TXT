VAX Computer Integrated					SPD 32.06.00
Telephony Message Desk, Version 1.0

DESCRIPTION:

The VAX Computer Integrated Telephony Message Desk (CITMD) application is a 
software product which is designed to enhance users' interactions with their 
office telephone system, by providing Telephony, Mail and Phonebook Services.

CITMD is run in conjunction with Digital Equipment Corporation's CIT products:

    VAX CIT Applications Interface (SPD No. 29.92.xx)

    VAX CIT Server (SPD No. 29.91.xx).
 
The type of CIT-compatible PBX being used will determine which of the CITMD 
features are available. Refer to the CIT Applications Interface SPD and 
documentation for further details.

CITMD Services

CITMD enables users to access the following features:

-   Dialing Services provide users with dialing features.  They can, for 
    example, make a call and answer a call by using CITMD commands.

-   Message Services provide a means of organizing messages left for or by 
    telephone callers.

-   Phonebook Services provide users with an on-line telephone directory.

User Types

The features required by a user depend on the task that the user must perform.  
Accordingly, CITMD provides two sets of features.  Each set is aimed at one of 
the two groups of CITMD users.  These groups are:

-   Message Attendants

    Attendants answer calls on behalf of other users, taking and passing on 
    messages. An attendant may be a full-time message desk attendant or, for 
    example, a group secretary to whom other users forward their phones.

    Attendants will also maintain the on-line System Phonebook.

-   General Users

    General Users consist of all other users of the application. They will use 
    CITMD to respond to telephone messages left for them, to make calls, and to 
    provide a Personal Phonebook in addition the generally available System 
    Phonebook.
