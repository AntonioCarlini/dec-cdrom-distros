 PRODUCT NAME:  DECnet SNA Remote Job Entry             SPD 26.85.05
                for OpenVMS, Version 1.4

 This SPD describes DECnet SNA Remote Job Entry for OpenVMS, which is
 available for the OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS AXP platforms. All infor-
 mation applies to both platforms unless otherwise indicated.

 DESCRIPTION

 DECnet SNA Remote Job Entry for OpenVMS (RJE) is a layered software
 product that allows suitably configured OpenVMS systems within a DEC-
 net network to function as an SNA/RJE workstation or group of work-
 stations that can transmit batch jobs to an IBM host and receive job
 output. The OpenVMS system user can prepare batch jobs in files, sub-
 mit the jobs, and obtain the job output. Access to the IBM SNA host
 environment is via one of the following products:

 o  DECnet SNA Gateway for Synchronous Transport

 o  DECnet SNA Gateway for Channel Transport

 o  DEC SNA Domain Gateway for Channel Transport

 o  VMS/SNA - an OpenVMS VAX layered product that supports users on the
    system where VMS/SNA is running

 By using batch interaction with the IBM host system, RJE can be used
 to submit data that can be used for periodic update of databases and
 other applications. Easily modified translation tables resident in ei-
 ther the SNA gateway or VMS/SNA convert ASCII code to a subset of IBM
 multi-national EBCDIC for transmission to the IBM host, and from EBCDIC
 to ASCII on reception of job output.

                                                         AE-EX17F-TE

 

 Features

 RJE offers the following features:

 o  Each workstation includes a console interface that an operator can
    use to communicate with the Job Entry System in the IBM host.

 o  RJE can support record sizes of up to 245 characters.

 o  RJE supports data compression on reader streams and data decompres-
    sion on printer and punch streams.

 o  The RJE Server can be run on the OpenVMS system to increase through-
    put of the SNA gateway. When using the DEC SNA Domain Gateway for
    Channel Transport for access to the IBM host system, the RJE Server
    must be run on the OpenVMS system.

 o  ASCII to EBCDIC translation is transparent to the user but can be
    inhibited with /NOTRANSLATE qualifier on the ASSIGN command.

 Sending Jobs to the IBM Host

 Workstation users submit jobs to OpenVMS queues. The workstation trans-
 mits the queued jobs to the IBM host over the input streams associ-
 ated with a queue.

 This queuing technique makes it possible for many RJE users to sub-
 mit jobs at the same time and to do so even if the workstation is in-
 active. When the operator sets the workstation on, the workstation trans-
 mits all the jobs in its queues. For each submitted job, the user spec-
 ifies one or more files containing JCL (Job Control Language) state-
 ments, data, or programs.

 Receiving Job Output

 The IBM host returns job output to a workstation over various output
 streams. Each IBM output stream will have an OpenVMS directory assigned
 to it. As output from jobs is received on an output stream, it is as-
 signed a file name identical to the name given to the job as it is ex-
 ecuted in the IBM system (normally names are specified by user sup-
 plied JCL). This mechanism allows easy identification of a particu-
 lar job when several users share the same job stream. In the SNA gate-
 way environment, job output may be directed to a system on the DEC-
 net network other than the initiating system.

 Managing the Workstation

 OpenVMS users with the required privilege can issue a set of restricted
 commands to manage the workstation. These commands allow the user to
 initialize and control the workstation, and to communicate interac-
 tively with the IBM batch subsystem. The following functions are avail-
 able:

 o  Set the workstation ON and OFF

 o  Stop the transmission of a job

 o  Collect logging information in a disk file

 o  Display status

 o  Obtain on-line help information

 Specifying a Server

 When using an SNA gateway, there is an option of running the RJEServer
 on the SNA gateway (default) or running the RJEServer on the OpenVMS
 node. (When using the Gateway-CT or VMS/SNA as the transport to the
 IBM host, you must run the RJEServer on the OpenVMS node.) By running
 the RJEServer on an OpenVMS node, you can utilize idle OpenVMS resources
 and increase throughput of your SNA gateway.

 INSTALLATION

 Only experienced customers should attempt installation of this prod-
 uct. Digital recommends that all other customers purchase Digital's
 Installation Services. These services provide for installation of the
 software product by an experienced Digital Software Specialist.

 Customer Responsibilities

 Before Digital installation of the software the customer must:

 o  Have previously installed all requisite hardware including termi-
    nals and SNA gateway products;

 o  Obtain, install, and demonstrate as operational any modems and other
    equipment and facilities necessary to interface to Digital's com-
    munications equipment;

 o  Demonstrate equivalence of operation for modems other than Bell Sys-
    tem 201C, 208A or 209A, AT&T 2596 or 2556, Dataphone II (2096A, Dig-
    ital 2500, or equivalent) type modems or, in Europe, PTT approved
    modems;

 o  Have generated, to Digital's satisfaction, any necessary IBM host
    software that will be communicating with the SNA gateway or VMS/SNA
    and the Remote Job Entry product;

 o  Make available for a reasonable period of time, as mutually agreed
    by Digital and the customer, all hardware, communications facil-
    ities, and terminals that are to be used during installation.

 Delays caused by any failure to meet these responsibilities will be
 charged at the prevailing rate for time and materials.

 Successful use of this product requires that:

 o  The customer must be prepared to work with both Digital and IBM sys-
    tems personnel to coordinate the pre-installation activities.


                                  4

 

 o  The customer should be capable of modifying IBM component gener-
    ation parameters to support either the SNA gateway or VMS/SNA and
    the Remote Job Entry software.

 ported, the customer must have a Digital supported SNA gateway or VMS
 /SNA configuration.

 To have a Digital supported SNA gateway or VMS/SNA configuration, pur-
 chase of the Transport Orientation/Installation Service (QSF0x-SZ) is
 REQUIRED in conjunction with the customer's first purchase of the gate-
 way.
