 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

 MAILbus 400[TM] Message Transfer Agent (MTA) for OpenVMS[TM] is a lay-
 ered software product that resides on an OpenVMS VAX[TM] system. MAIL-
 bus 400 MTA provides electronic messaging services in an open network
 environment. These services are used by messaging applications, such
 as user agents and gateways. MAILbus 400 MTA for OpenVMS provides the
 electronic messaging services of an X.400 MTA, designed to conform to
 the 1992 CCITT series of recommendations and the 1988 joint CCITT and
 ISO Message Handling System Standards and their subsequent revisions.
 A messaging network based on MAILbus 400 MTAs can function as all, or
 part of, a Private Management Domain or Administration Management Do-
 main.

 MAILbus 400 MTA for OpenVMS uses DECnet[TM]/OSI[R] for OpenVMS for OSI
 protocol support, and DEC[TM] X.500 Directory Service for directory
 services.

 MAILbus 400 MTA for OpenVMS operates over the OSI protocols, as sup-
 ported by DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS.

 MAILbus 400 MTA can communicate with:

 o  Another MAILbus 400 MTA

 o  A VAX Message Router[TM]/X.400 Gateway

 o  Another vendor's X.400 MTA

 MAILbus 400 MTA for OpenVMS provides management services conforming
 to the Digital Enterprise Management Architecture (EMA), integrated
 with DECnet/OSI. This provides local and remote management of MAIL-
 bus 400 MTA operation.

 MAILbus 400 MTA for OpenVMS supports an interface for messaging ap-
 plications such as user agents and gateways; access to this is pro-
 vided by MAILbus 400 Application Program Interface for OpenVMS.

 MAILbus 400 MTA for OpenVMS provides the following services to col-
 lect information about messages:

 o  Accounting services, to record particular items of information about
    messages.

 o  Archiving services, to retain complete copies of messages.

 o  Message history logging services, to record information about mes-
    sages for tracing purposes.

 MAILbus 400 MTA for OpenVMS provides an Interpersonal Messaging Ser-
 vice (IPMS) bodypart conversion service, based on recipient capabil-
 ities registered in the directory. The set of bodypart converters pro-
 vided with MAILbus 400 MTA for OpenVMS provides a selected set of con-
 versions between the following bodypart types:

 o  IA5

 o  Teletex

 o  ISO/6937

                                  2

 

 o  General text (for ISO IR repertoires covering ISOLatin1, ISO/6937,
    and Teletex)

 o  DEC Multinational Character Set

 o  Message Router Text

 o  WPS-PLUS[TM]

 o  DECdx[TM]

 o  DDIF[TM]

 o  ODIF (for Document Application Profiles Q111, Q112, Q121)

 In addition to providing conversion services, MAILbus 400 MTA for OpenVMS
 supports transfer and receipt of any X.400 IPMS bodypart types, and
 non-IPMS content types.

 MAILbus 400 MTA is typically used in conjunction with other Digital-
 supplied messaging products, such as user agents and gateways. The fol-
 lowing are examples of messaging products that can be used in conjunc-
 tion with MAILbus 400 MTA to provide a complete messaging solution:

 o  MAILbus 400 Message Router Gateway for
    OpenVMS-This provides a gateway between the X.400 environment and
    Message Router systems.

 o  DEC/EDI[TM] for OpenVMS-This provides a wide range of services to
    enable Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between business appli-
    cations.

 o  OpenServer 400[TM] NetWare[R] MHS Gateway to X.400-This provides
    a gateway between MAILbus 400 MTA and NetWare MHS electronic mail
    system.

 o  OpenServer 400 cc:Mail[R] Gateway to X.400 - This provides a gate-
    way between MAILbus 400 MTA and cc:Mail electronic mail system.

 o  OpenServer 400 Microsoft[R] Mail for PC Networks Gateway to X.400-
    This provides a gateway between MAILbus 400 MTA and Microsoft Mail
