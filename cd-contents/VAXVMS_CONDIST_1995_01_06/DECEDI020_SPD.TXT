    DESCRIPTION

    DEC/EDI offers application developers all the facilities necessary to
    EDI-enable Business Applications within an Enterprise. Electronic Data
    Interchange (EDI) enables users to electronically exchange structured
    business documents such as Purchase Orders, Dispatch Advice and In-
    voices with their Trading Partners using International, National and
    Industry-specific EDI standards. Extensive communication options are
    also provided to facilitate inter-enterprise communication via EDI VANs
    or direct with Trading Partners using OSI[R] protocols.

    DEC/EDI uses a Client/Server architecture to provide EDI services to
    local and remote Business Applications hosted on multi-vendor plat-
    forms within an enterprise.

    Note: This release of DEC/EDI cannot be used in conjuction with, or to
    upgrade, DEC/EDI V1.3 software.

    DEC/EDI Application Client

    The DEC/EDI Application Client facilitates the integration of local
    and remote Business Applications to the DEC/EDI Server, to make them
    EDI-capable. ObjectBroker (DEC ACA Services) is used to link the lo-
    cally or remotely installed DEC/EDI Application Clients to the DEC/EDI
    Server, using either TCP/IP or DECnet communication protocols.

    DEC/EDI Clients are available today for the OpenVMS VAX, OpenVMS AXP
    and DEC OSF/1[R] AXP platforms. These DEC/EDI Application Clients can
    interoperate with a DEC/EDI Server running on either OpenVMS VAX or
    OpenVMS AXP platforms.

    The DEC/EDI Application Clients provide both a Command Line Interface
    (CLI) and an Application Program Interface (API). The CLI can be used
    either interactively or run from a suitably coded script file (com-
    mand file).

    The interface provided by the DEC/EDI Application Client is file-based
    and allows for the Business Application to POST and FETCH files to and
    from Trading Partners via the DEC/EDI Server.

    The DEC/EDI Application Client also provides the following functions:

    o  Enables local and remote Business Applications to extract document
       status information via the TRACK Command, from the DEC/EDI Server.

    o  POST and FETCH documents to and from the DEC/EDI Server and by-pass
       the Mapping and Translation functions, for transmission and receipt
       from trading partners via the DEC/EDI Communication Component.

    DEC/EDI Server

    The DEC/EDI Server consists of the following components which reside
    on the same node:

    o  DEC/EDI FileBridge Component

    o  DEC/EDI Translation Component

    o  DEC/EDI Communications Component

                                     2

 



    DEC/EDI for OpenVMS VAX, Version 2.0                  SPD 31.70.04


    o  DEC/EDI Operational Management Component


    FileBridge Component

    FileBridge is a table-driven "MAPPER" with a set of data manipulation
    operators for selected classes of commonly encountered EDI applica-
    tion data. This capability is used to convert data from the Business
    Application format to that required for Translation into the Trading
    Partner format as well as formatting data received from the trading
    partner to the format expected by the Business Application.

    The Mapping Process consists of:

    o  Data Specification

    The customer defines the application file structure, and parameters
    for mapping between the application file and the EDI standard through
    a forms-based user interface. FileBridge then generates a conversion
    table that is used to map data from/to the application file formats.

    o  User Defined Mapping

    FileBridge allows fields to be moved directly to the destination or
    to have built-in mathematical/logical/string operations to be performed
    upon the fields. The user interface guides the user through this pro-
    cess. The user can define and add code through "hooks" for more com-
    plex processing.

    o  Data Definition Extracts

    FileBridge also allows for the extraction of Application file record
    definitions from CDD/Repository.

    Components

    The components of FileBridge are:

    o  FileBridge User Interface (UI)

    The UI consists of a set of menus and forms that allow users to cre-
    ate, modify, and compile FileBridge tables.

    o  FileBridge Run-time

                                     3

 



    DEC/EDI for OpenVMS VAX, Version 2.0                  SPD 31.70.04


    The Run-time process uses the information in a compiled FileBridge ta-
    ble to map data between the Business Application file and the format
    required for transmission to the trading partner.


    Translation Component

    The Translation Component takes data that has come from the Business
    Application and transforms it into the standard EDI formats required
    for transmission to the Trading Partner. It also takes incoming EDI
    data, that has been received from a Trading Partner by the Communi-
    cations Component, and converts it into the format that is suitable
    for the Mapper to decode and pass to the Application Client.

    The Translation Component provides the following features:

    o  Support for multiple versions of messages (transactions) and EDI
       standards

    o  Supports the transmission of 8-bit national character sets

    o  Compliance checking at Trading Partner level

    o  Trading Partner specific Code Translation

    o  User-selectable control number generation

    o  Test transmissions

    o  Event and Error logging

    An editor is provided to enable users to customise the messages de-
    livered with the product to create new messages for industry specific
    and Trading Partner specific messages as well as create new messages
    based on ANSI X12, TDCC, EDIFACT, ODETTE, and TRADACOMS[TM] syntax rules
    supported by this version of the product. The editor also allows for
    the creation of new versions of EDI Standard dictionaries.

    Trading Partner agreement details, including the message formats be-
    ing used, are recorded in the Trading Partner Profiles. The Transla-
    tion Component uses the information in the Trading Partner Profiles
    and the Message Database to perform compliance checking and to check
    the validity of the transaction.

    These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
    sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
    system environment, configuration, and software options.

    Additional disk space is required depending on the number of Mapping
    tables, performance needs, message size and software options.

    The minimum memory supported is 64MB. However, the use of this soft-
    ware in conjunction with increased memory (128MB) and multiple disks
    improves performance.
