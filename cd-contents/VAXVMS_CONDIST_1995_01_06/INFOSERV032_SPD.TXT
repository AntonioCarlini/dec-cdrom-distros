 PRODUCT NAME:  InfoServer Software, Version 3.2        SPD 33.20.09

 DESCRIPTION

 InfoServer Software is the software component of a special-purpose hard-
 ware/software system that makes up an InfoServer Ethernet-based stor-
 age server. This product supports locally attached SCSI CD-ROMs, SCSI
 disk drives, magneto-optical drives, and SCSI tape drives.

 The server contains 4 MB of memory, of which 3 MB can be used for cache.
 The InfoServer 100 and InfoServer 150 system boxes contain either an
 internal RZ23 (104 MB) or an internal RZ23L (121 MB) drive. The Info-
 Server 150VXT contains an internal RZ24 (209 MB), or an internal RZ24L
 (245 MB) drive. All InfoServer 100 and 150 system boxes contain one
 integral RRD42 CD-ROM drive, and some packages may include external
 RRD42 CD-ROM drives (600 MB each). The InfoServer 1000 system box by
 itself does not contain any storage, although certain InfoServer 1000
 system packages will include CD-ROM drives, hard disks or tapes. Note
 that either a directly-connected CD-ROM drive or a CD-ROM drive
 connected to an InfoServer running V3.1 or higher software on the same
 local area network (LAN) is required for software and function updates.

 The rights to connect to the InfoServer are granted with the InfoSer-
 ver system license. Supported clients are listed in Table 1 - Client
 Support Matrix in this Software Product Description (SPD).

 The InfoServer is the server component in a client-server model. To-
 gether, clients and servers form a LAN-based network in which server-
 based storage can be accessed from client systems. Virtual disks, both
 physical disk media and sets of logical disk blocks, can be served to
 the network by the InfoServer. Client systems running appropriate client
 software can connect to virtual disks and tape devices served by the
 InfoServer, and use them as though they were locally attached devices.

                               DIGITAL                 October 1994

                                                         AE-PE58J-TE

 

 All InfoServer systems, with the exception of the InfoServer 150VXT,
 are shipped with the Disk Function Access enabled. With this function,
 clients can access and share CD-ROMs, hard disks, and magneto-optical
 drives attached to the InfoServer. InfoServer 150VXT variants can be
 upgraded to this functionality by purchasing a Disk Function Access
 license and CD-ROM kit as upgrade options. Please refer to the Optional
 Software section of this SPD.

 With the Tape Function Access option, clients can also share SCSI tape
 devices attached to the InfoServer. Clients can use this to perform
 remote incremental backup and software distribution as if they were
 locally attached. For OpenVMS clients, please note, however, that full
 standalone backup is not supported. (This is an OpenVMS client lim-
 itation.) Please refer to the Optional Software section of this SPD.

 Specialized software protocols provide access to the server on the LAN.
 These protocols are Local Area Transport (LAT) for remote management,
 LASTport and LASTport/Disk for virtual disk access, LASTport/Tape for
 SCSI tape access, and Maintenance Operations Protocol (MOP) for down-
 line loading.

 InfoServer operation across low-speed bridges is possible; however,
 the underlying LASTport protocol assumes a low rate of packet loss.
 Therefore, low-speed bridges may cause significant performance degra-
 dation. For this reason, operation of the InfoServer is supported only
 over 10 megabit bridges.

 Features

 Preinstallation of InfoServer Software with Simplified Updating

 Customer or field service installation of InfoServer Software on the
 system is not required. The server boots when powered-on. For the Info-
 Server 100 and 150 models, the InfoServer software is factory-installed
 on the internal RZ23/RZ23L/RZ24/RZ24L disk. For the InfoServer 1000,
 the InfoServer Software is in a FLASH ROM on the system board. A sim-
 ple server command is provided to update the InfoServer Software from
 CD-ROM, locally connected or connected to another InfoServer on the
 same LAN.

                                  2

 

 Network Updating

 Version 3.2 allows InfoServer managers to update an InfoServer sys-
 tem from a compact disc mounted on another InfoServer system on the
 LAN.

 The InfoServer 1000 system FLASH ROM may also be updated by downline
 loading of an appropriate image via MOP. This image is provided on the
 InfoServer kernel distribution CD-ROM. The MOP server may be another
 InfoServer (100, 150, 150VXT or 1000) or an OpenVMS system with an at-
 tached CD-ROM drive in the same LAN.

 All update operations (FUNCTIONS, MOP, SYSTEM, and VXT) are supported
 using the BIND and UNBIND commands and the existing UPDATE com-
 mands.

 Autoconfiguration (Automount)

 The server autoconfigures devices based on the volume label and au-
 tomatically creates service names for media present on the server. The
 InfoServer will recognize the following formats (for both single and
 multi-format CD-ROMs): ISO 9660, High Sierra, ULTRIX UFS, ODS-2, and
 Apple[R] HFS.

 Local and Remote Management Capability

 The server can be managed by either a locally attached console (not
 supplied) or a remote LAT terminal. Local and remote console capabil-
 ities include configuration management, diagnostic information (built-
 in self-test and diagnostic messages), and server control.

 A local console is not required for the default mode of unattended op-
 eration, but may be helpful in diagnosing hardware or software prob-
 lems.

 Password Protected Management Interface

 A password-protected management interface allows control and monitor-
 ing of server activity, with auto-prompting at any point in the com-
 mand sequence, command-line recall, and built-in help.

                                  3

 

 Access Control - Server Access Control

 Every InfoServer, and its corresponding set of clients, is a member
 of a single LASTport group. A LASTport group is a mechanism used by
 the InfoServer Software to logically subdivide the InfoServer network.
 Client systems and InfoServers must belong to the same LASTport group
 for clients to access virtual disks on the InfoServer. Up to 1,024 LAST-
 port groups can coexist in a single LAN.

 Access Control - Management Interface Access Control

 o  Password protection

 o  LAT group codes

 Access Control - Device Access Control

 o  Password protection

 o  Concurrent usage quotas - the number of connections allowed to a
    service or virtual disk can be set. This can be used to manage the
    number of users allowed to access a given application or data.

 Multiple Read/Write Virtual Disks on a Single Physical Disk

 The InfoServer can serve read/write disk partitions. A partition is
 a logical subset of a read/write disk. A single disk can be subdivided
 into several partitions, each of which can be served to the network
 independently as a virtual disk. The access mode supports a single writer
 or multiple readers, but not both concurrently (to prevent acciden-
 tal corruption of data on the disk).

 Read/Write Data Back-Up

 Back-up operations can be performed locally via server commands or re-
 motely using client-specific utilities.

 InfoServer Tape Function for Remote Back-up

 With the Tape Function Access option, customers can perform back-ups
 via SCSI tape devices on the InfoServer.

                                  4

 

 Note: The InfoServer is not meant as an optimal performance controller
 for all tape devices. Rather, use of the tape function with InfoSer-
 ver is provided as a means of convenience for sharing a seldom-used
 and costly device. Many factors, including network load, block size,
 and additional load on the InfoServer contribute to the overall per-
 formance characteristics of any given tape operation.

 One InfoServer client at a time can access an SCSI tape device. Once
 the client has completed the task and disconnects from the device, it
 becomes available to the other clients on the LAN. For supported de-
 vices (see Device Support Table 2), the InfoServer will automatically
 verify firmware revision levels of attached tape devices. InfoServer
 Software, Version 3.2 supports OpenVMS VAX Version 5.4 and above AND makes
 the tape backup capabilities available to OpenVMS VAX users at a min-
 imum of Version 5.4. PLEASE NOTE THAT USERS MUST INSTALL INFOSERVER VMS
 CLIENT QA-GGWAA-HX FOR TAPE FUNCTIONALITY FOR OPENVMS VERSIONS 5.4 THROUGH 
 5.5-N. InfoServer Software Version 3.2 also includes
 the capability of enabling PC clients with tape backup capabilities
 to perform backup to tapes attached to the InfoServer using Symantec[R]'s
 Norton Backup utility (sold separately). InfoServer Client for DOS Ver-
 sion 2.0, along with InfoServer kernel Version 3.2, supports this ca-
 pability.

 CD/R Function Access

 Using the InfoServer 1000 as a network storage server, users can ac-
 cess a CD/R device over the network from a DOS, OpenVMS VAX or AXP,
 Macintosh[R], or ULTRIX environment. They can create (write) their own
 CDs in a file format native to their environments without any addi-
 tional software, or they can use third party formatters to create ISO
 9660 CDs from those native environments.

 The InfoServer 1000 CD/R functionality can be used for several appli-
 cations including: the distribution of volumes of technical manuals,
 updates of databases, replacement of microfiche, or near-term stor-
 age of data.

 A CD/R function access license and media/documentation kit are avail-
 able to use with the InfoServer for compact disc mastering. Additional
 requirements include: a CD/R device, a hard disk for staging data (1
 GB recommended), a CD reader, and formatter software for converting
 files to the ISO 9660 standard.

 File System Independence

 InfoServer is a "virtual device" server. InfoServer does not impose
 a file system on the virtual devices that it serves, instead the client
 system interprets the on-disk structure. Multiple on-disk structures
 can be served on a single InfoServer simultaneously. InfoServer is ca-
 pable of automatically recognizing ODS-2, High Sierra, ISO 9660, UL-
 TRIX UFS, and HFS (Apple) disk formats and creating service names which
 match the volume name. Other disk formats may be named manually through
 the InfoServer management interface.

 Automatic Failover to Duplicate Media

 The LASTport protocol is designed to allow client systems to perform
 automatic failover between duplicate media. Failover means that a user
 connected to a service that becomes unavailable (such as a CD-ROM that
 is removed from the system) will be automatically connected to an iden-
 tical service on the same or another InfoServer. If the service is not
 found, the InfoServer client will return the appropriate message to

                                  6

 

 the user. The implementation of failover varies from client to client.
 Refer to Software Requirements, Table 1 - Client Support Matrix.

 Load Balancing

 InfoServer dynamically calculates a service rating for virtual disks
 based upon load. These ratings are used by some client systems when
 connections are requested. When the same disk is offered more than once
 on the network, load balancing is provided. This includes the abil-
 ity to load balance connections within a single InfoServer when du-
 plicate virtual disks are present, as well as between multiple Info-
 Servers with duplicate media on the network. Client systems will se-
 lect the highest rated service. The implementation of load balancing
 varies from client to client. Refer to Table 1 - Client Support Ma-
 trix. Initial System Load

 Some client systems implement Initial System Load (ISL) using a com-
 bination of server-implemented, down-line load and virtual disk ca-
 pabilities. This feature eliminates the need for locally attached soft-
 ware distribution devices for initial system load on those client sys-
 tems. Please refer to Table 1 - Client Support Matrix in this SPD for
 client ISL capabilities.

 ISO 9660 Support

 InfoServer Software, Version 3.2 contains OpenVMS savesets necessary
 to install support for reading ISO 9660 and High Sierra formatted com-
 pact discs. These savesets can be installed on any system running Open-
 VMS VAX, Version 5.4, at a minimum, allowing access to ISO 9660 for-
 matted CD-ROM discs on the InfoServer. Note that this support only en-
 ables OpenVMS to recognize these formats, not to run any DOS executa-
 bles. Please note that the ISO 9660 support for OpenVMS becomes a na-
 tive utility bundled into OpenVMS VAX Version 6.0 and above, and Open-
 VMS AXP Version 1.0 and above.

 InfoServer Monitor Utility




                                  7

 

 InfoServer monitor is a utility which runs on VMS systems. This util-
 ity monitors devices to ensure they remain available when events, such
 as the following, occur:

 o  A compact disc is replaced with a new disc or volume

 o  Connection is broken between the OpenVMS client and the InfoSer-
    ver system

 o  Data has been written to an InfoServer hard disk (disk must be re-
    mounted)

 Note that the InfoServer Monitor Utility is not a supported program
 at this time.

 Optional Functions Which Increase InfoServer Capabilities

 InfoServer Software, Version 3.2 enables installation of InfoServer
 functional upgrades from CD-ROMs. As new functions become available,
 customers can purchase separately and install each function they wish
 to make available on the LAN. For example, customers can add Tape Func-
 tion Access to their previously installed base packaged systems by pur-
 chasing the InfoServer Tape Function Access license and CD-ROM kit (see
 OPTIONAL SOFTWARE section). They then can install the CD-ROM on their
 InfoServer, which initializes the tape functionality on the InfoSer-
 ver.
