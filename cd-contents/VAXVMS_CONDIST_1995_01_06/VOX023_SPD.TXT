    cabulary

                               DIGITAL                     July 1994

                                                         AE-LZ25F-TE

 

 The telephone network interface can be either analog (tip-ring, RJ11)
 using the DTC04 option or digital (T1, RJ45) using the DTCN5/DTC05 op-
 tions. Refer to the HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS section for details of the
 network interface requirements.

 The text-to-speech synthesis subsystem is comparable to the DECtalk
 family of speech synthesizers. Name pronunciation software enhances
 the pronunciation accuracy of surnames and placenames. A user-defined
 dictionary capability is also provided for alternate pronunciation of
 synthesized text.

 The digitized speech subsystem supports encoding at 64 Kilobits per
 second (Kbps) u-Law, 64 Kbps A-Law, 32 Kbps ADPCM, 24 Kbps ADPCM, 16
 Kbps ADPCM, and 16 Kbps sub-band.

 Note: Not all encoding methods are available in all modes of operation.
 Refer to the HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS section for details.

 The isolated word recognition software, licensed as part of the base
 kit, and the continuous word recognition software, licensed separately,
 are optimized for native speakers of American English. Both the iso-
 lated word recognition subsystem voice recognition standard templates
 and the optional continuous word recognition subsystem voice recog-
 nition templates contain speaker-independent recognition support for
 the digits zero through nine, and the words "yes," "no," and, as used
 as a substitute for zero, "oh."

 Documentation and system routines are provided to allow the creation
 of site and application specific isolated word speaker-dependent tem-
 plates.

 Note: This feature is currently supported on the DTC05 in full-function
 mode, not in multiline mode.

 DECvoice Software provides users with the capability to monitor the
 progress of calls that it originates. Application software can use this
 feature to determine if dial tone, busy signal, ringing, and/or call
 pickup has occurred.

 The DTCN5 option is used to connect the DECvoice system to a maximum
 of three digital DS1 telephone circuits. It consists of a quad Q-bus
 module and a bulkhead adapter assembly used for telephone network con-
 nection and a voice interconnect bus connection.

 The T1 physical interface complies with Section 10 (DSX-1 Intercon-
 nection), LATA Switched System Generic Requirements and "Interconnec-
 tion Specifications for Digital Cross-Connects," CB119, Issue 3. Each
 DSX-1 circuit can be up to 655 feet in length.

 For direct connection to the telephone network a network interface such
 as a CSU is required.

 Direct connections can be made to PBXs that support DSX-1 circuits.
 However, many PBXs have distance limitations of approximately 100 feet.
 This distance can be extended if the T1 connections are made through
 a CSU.

 Connection to Analog circuits can be made through a channel bank.

 Signal framing can be either D3/D4 or ESF compliant selectable under
 software control. Zero-density requirement can be met through either
 Jam Bit 7 or B8ZS techniques selectable under software control.

                                  8

 

 A variety of signaling techniques are available on a per-channel ba-
 sis under software control including E&M, FXO/FXS, and DPO/DPT. Hook-
 flash signaling can be detected and generated. DTMF or pulse dialing
 can be selected on a per-channel basis.

 Automatic Number Identification (ANI) and/or Dialed Number Identifi-
 cation Service (DNIS) can be received (if provided by the PBX/Central
 Office) through DTMF when E&M protocol is used (MF is not supported).

 The DTC05 option is a quad Q-bus module that provides voice genera-
 tion and recognition capability. DECvoice Software allows the DTC05
 option to operate in either full-function mode or multiline mode.

 Multiline mode supports the following functions:

 o  Call Progress Analysis

 o  Automatic Volume Leveling (AVL) of messages

 o  Support for eight voice channels

 o  Digitized record and playback (16, 24, and 32 Kbps)

    Note: 64 Kbps is not supported in this mode.

 o  DTMF tone detection

 Full function mode provides the following features:

 o  Automatic Volume Leveling (AVL) of messages

 o  Support for one voice channel

 o  Digitized record and playback (16, 24, 32 and 64 Kbps)

 o  Call progress analysis

 o  Text-to-speech synthesis

 o  Speaker-dependent isolated word recognition

 o  Limited vocabulary speaker-independent isolated word recognition

 o  Optional speaker-independent continuous word recognition

                                  9

 

 o  Recording algorithm conversions

 Processor Restrictions:

 o  64 KB of Q-bus I/O space is required for each DTCN5 and DTC05 mod-
    ule installed in the system.

 o  One DTCN5 module per system is permitted.

 o  The voice interconnect bus is divided into three physical segments.
    Each segment supports 31 voice channels. A maximum of four DTC05
    options per segment are supported. Although there are 93 voice chan-
    nels, a maximum of 72 phone lines per system is supported. Addi-
    tional voice channels can be used for features such as music-on-
    hold and algorithm conversions. Any combination of multiline and
    full-function modules can be configured.

 o  VAX 4000 Models 100, 100A and 105A systems requires a B400 series
    Q-bus Expansion Box.

 o  Power and bus loading constraints may limit the maximum DTC05 con-
    figuration (e.g., a maximum of 11 DTC05 and 1 DTCN5 can be supported
    on the VAX 4000 Model 300 system, using a BA440 Expansion Box, with
    no other options).

 o  The performance of the realtime portions of the system is sensi-
    tive to processor, VAXcluster, and device-interrupt latency. Degra-
    dations will be noticed if DTCN5/DTC05 interrupts are blocked by
    any other software and/or hardware in the system. It is recommended
    that DECvoice applications are configured to run at elevated pri-
    ority. A dedicated VAX system is recommended for optimal DECvoice
    performance.

 o  Based on typical application performance the following table lists
    the typical maximum recommended number of active voice lines per
    system processor type and does not necessarily correspond to or-
    derable standard products. This table is intended as a guideline
    only.

 o  The DTCN5/DTC05 modules are not distributed, nor shareable, across
    nodes in the VAXcluster. The module must reside locally, that is,
    on the processor that performs the calls to the DECvoice libraries.

 o  A minimum of 1 MB of memory per voice line configured is recommended.

 Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1)

 Disk space required for    30,000 blocks
 installation:              (14.6 MB)

 These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
 sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
 system environment, configuration, and software options.

 If voice recordings are stored on disk, significant disk space can be
 required. As general guideline in planning disk space requirements the
 following information can be used:

 OPTIONAL HARDWARE

 The DTCN5 option is listed as an indirect connect device to the pub-
 lic telephone network. If a direct connection to the telephone net-
 work is desired, then a network interface device such as a CSU is re-
 quired (Digital model DFDO2 or DFDO3 can be used). If an Analog con-
 nection to the network is desired, then a channel bank is required.
