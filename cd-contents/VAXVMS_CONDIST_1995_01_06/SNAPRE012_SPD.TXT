 PRODUCT NAME:  DECnet SNA Printer Emulator             SPD 26.70.06
                for OpenVMS, V1.2

 This SPD describes DECnet SNA Printer Emulator for OpenVMS, which is
 available for the OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS AXP platforms. All infor-
 mation applies to both platforms unless otherwise indicated.

 DESCRIPTION

 DECnet SNA Printer Emulator for OpenVMS (PrE) is an OpenVMS layered
 software product that allows suitably configured OpenVMS systems within
 a DECnet network or running VMS/SNA software to receive printable data
 from IBM[R] host-based applications. These applications will origi-
 nally have been developed to produce output for an IBM 3287 printer
 in system mode that is connected to an IBM 3274 cluster controller in
 a Systems Network Architecture (SNA) networking environment. Access
 from the IBM system to OpenVMS systems is via one of the following prod-
 ucts:

 o  DECnet SNA Gateway for Synchronous Transport

 o  DECnet SNA Gateway for Channel Transport

 o  DEC SNA Domain Gateway for Channel Transport

 o  VMS/SNA - an OpenVMS VAX layered product that supports users on the
    system where VMS/SNA is running

 In an actual IBM 3287 environment, data transfer is one way (from host
 to printer) and generates hard copy. The PrE Access software will al-
 low OpenVMS users to direct the received output either to be printed
 via the OpenVMS Print Symbiont or spooled to a disk file.

 Features

                               DIGITAL                 November 1993

                                                         AE-DE55G-TE

 

 The following is a summary of functions provided by PrE:

 o  PrE is configured and controlled via a Digital Command Language (DCL)
    style interface for ease of use.

 o  PrE can accept data in SNA Character String (SCS) format (LU Type
    1) and 3270 Data Stream format (LU Type 3).

 o  PrE recognizes the following 3270 Data Stream orders:

       CR - Carriage Return
       DUP - Duplicate (converted to a semicolon)
       EM - End Message
       EUA - Erase Unprotected to Address
       FF - Form-feed
       FM - Field Mark (converted to an asterisk)
       GE - Graphics Escape (converted to a hyphen)
       NL - Newline
       PT - Program Tab
       RA - Repeat to Address
       SBA - Set Buffer Address
       SF - Start Fields

 o  PrE supports the following 3270 Data Stream commands:

       WRITE
       ERASE/WRITE
       ERASE/WRITE ALTERNATE
       ERASE ALL UNPROTECTED

 o  PrE will recognize the following SNA Character String orders:

       BS - Backspace
       CR - Carriage Return
       FF - Form-feed
       GE - Graphics Escape (converted to a hyphen)
       HT - Horizontal Tab
       IRS - Inter Record Separator
       LF - Linefeed
       NL - Newline
       SHF - Set Horizontal Format
       SVF - Set Vertical Format

                                  2

 

       TRN - Transparency
       VCS - Vertical Channel Select
       VT - Vertical Tab

 o  PrE accepts but ignores the following SNA Character String orders:

       BEL - Bell
       ENP - Enable Presentation
       INP - Inhibit Presentation
       SLD - Set Line Density

 o  PrE supports the 3287 printer Program Attention (PA1 and PA2) keys
    and the CANCEL PRINT key using commands entered at the user inter-
    face.

 o  PrE does not support the Printer Authorization Matrix feature, and
    it does not emulate the 3287's REPRINT key function.

 o  PrE supports 1-255 copies of the print job to be printed.

 o  PrE supports a maximum of 127 sessions simultaneously.

 o  PrE supports the ability to submit a print job for another user.
    The print job will run exactly as if that user submitted the re-
    quest. Accounting information is logged to that user's account. The
    user name string can be 1 to 12 characters in length and should be
    a valid username on the system.

 o  PrE supports multiple form types. The form type is specified by us-
    ing either a numeric value or a form name. These form types can re-
    fer to the print image width, length or type of paper. Codes for
    these form types are installation-defined.

 o  PrE supports the ability to change queue name, forms, number, num-
    ber of copies, user name and choice of deleting the output stream
    files without stopping the session.

 o  PrE supports the deletion of output files that are spooled to print-
    ers as a user-selectable setting.

 o  PrE provides an option to send an INIT SELF request to the IBM ap-
    plication.

                                  3

 

 o  PrE supports LU security through the ability to specify a password
    for providing additional security to access the LU. This feature
    is supported in the DECnet SNA Gateway for Synchronous Transport,
    the DECnet SNA Gateway for Channel Transport, the DEC SNA Domain
    Gateway for Channel Transport, and VMS/SNA V2.0.

    product and PrE;

 o  Make available for a reasonable period of time, as mutually agreed
    by Digital and the customer, all hardware, communications facil-
    ities, and terminals that are to be used during installation.

 Delays caused by any failure to meet these responsibilities will be
 charged at the prevailing rate for time and materials.

                                  4
