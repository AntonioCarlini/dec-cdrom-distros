 PRODUCT NAME:  PATHWORKS V1.0 for OpenVMS (NetWare[R]) SPD 41.47.00

 DESCRIPTION

 PATHWORKS V1.0 for OpenVMS (NetWare) is an OpenVMS layered applica-
 tion that provides the functions of NetWare V3.x server in a PC LAN
 environment. It is a member of the PATHWORKS family of products which
 provides a framework for integrating personal computers into an or-
 ganization's total information system allowing different types of users
 to share information and network services across the entire organi-
 zation.

 The PATHWORKS family includes PC LAN server products running on Open-
 VMS, DEC OSF/1[R], ULTRIX, SCO[TM] UNIX[R], and OS/2[R] platforms pro-
 viding industry standard Network Operating System (NOS) services that
 use Novell[R]'s NetWare, Microsoft[R]'s LAN Manager, and Apple[R]'s
 AppleShare[R] protocols. The PATHWORKS family also includes client prod-
 ucts providing both clients software for these servers and also en-
 terprisewide support capabilities such as wide area transports (DEC-
 net and TCP/IP) and applications such as Mail and Terminal Emulation,
 allowing DOS, Windows[TM], Windows NT[TM], OS/2, and Macintosh[R] clients
 to participate as full peers in a widely-distributed computing envi-
 ronment.

 Features

 PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) adds a new dimension to general pur-
 pose VAX/OpenVMS systems. In addition to providing traditional sup-
 port for business, scientific, and engineering applications, this prod-
 uct allows VAX/OpenVMS systems to appear to DOS clients as a Novell-
 certified NetWare server.


                               DIGITAL                  January 1994

                                                         AE-PPMGA-TH


 

 The major features of PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) include:

 o  Novell-certified file and print services using Novell's NetWare Core
    Protocol and the IPX/SPX transports.

 o  Access to services provided by PATHWORKS V1.0 for OpenVMS (NetWare)
    available to both PATHWORKS V5.0 for DOS and Windows (NetWare) clients
    as well as for other NetWare clients (with appropriately licensed
    components; see Licensing section for details).

 o  Files are stored on the server in native OpenVMS format, Record Man-
    agement Services (RMS). This allows information stored by the PCs
    via PATHWORKS V1.0 for OpenVMS (NetWare) to be shared with tradi-
    tional OpenVMS users. In particular, this feature allows the shar-
    ing of information between all PATHWORKS clients, even if they are
    not using NetWare.

 o  File and print services management using standard NetWare manage-
    ment utilities, such as FCONSOLE, PCONSOLE, and SYSCON. These func-
    tions, combined with other standard systems and network management
    utilities for OpenVMS, such as Remote System Management (RSM), pro-
    vide a powerful set of tools for total distributed systems manage-
    ment.

 o  Both NetWare-only, or NetWare combined with OpenVMS, security mod-
    els can be applied in this environment providing greater flexibil-
    ity and added security to your system.

 o  A VAX-11 Mail server is provided that works in conjunction with the
    PATHWORKS Mail client to provide clients with access to enterprisewide
    electronic mail over DECnet.

 o  A DECnet tunnel-function for the IPX transport is provided. This
    utility encapsulates IPX packets in DECnet packets thereby allow-
    ing information sent via IPX to be transported anywhere within a
    DECnet network. This allows, for example, existing DECnet-based wide
    area networks (WANs) to be used to transport IPX-based traffic from
    IPX local area networks (LANs) on one side of the wide area net-
    work (WAN) to another.

                                  2


 

 o  Novell Virtual Terminal (NVT) support is provided allowing IPX-based
    terminal emulation software to be used on a PC for direct, inter-
    active connections to the systems where PATHWORKS V1.0 for Open-
    VMS (NetWare) is operating.

 o  Support for NetWare (file and print) Application Programming In-
    terfaces (APIs) are included.

 o  The standard UNIX "Transport Layer Interface" (TLI), is used to pro-
    vide an Application Programming Interface (API) directly to the Open-
    VMS IPX and SPX transports included with this product. This fea-
    ture provides the means for other OpenVMS applications to make use
    of the PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) IPX/SPX transport.

 o  The host-based SCONSOLE Utility provides systems managers and ad-
    ministrators with a single menu-driven tool to configure and to ad-
    minister OpenVMS-specific functions such as starting and stopping
    the file server, the IPX/SPX transports, or the DECnet tunneling
    function for IPX.

 o  License Management software that provides the capability to

    a. distribute PATHWORKS client-based licenses across a network;

    b. validate access by clients with PATHWORKS client-based licenses;
       and

    c. support client access via server-based licenses validated through
       the local LMF database.
    Note that (a) and (b) above are accomplished in conjunction with
    PATHWORKS license management software for the client.

 NetWare Volumes/File Services

 PATHWORKS V1.0 for OpenVMS (NetWare) provides DOS- and Windows-based
 NetWare clients with a remote file system that appears as a transpar-
 ent extension of the client system's local computing environment.

 PATHWORKS V1.0 for OpenVMS (NetWare) services are based on the Nov-
 ell's NetWare NCP (NetWare Core Protocol) protocols and have been cer-
 tified by Novell as a fully compliant implementation of Portable Net-
 Ware, V3.01B.

 There are three types of RMS file formats that are allowed and sup-
 ported on each volume:

 -  Stream

 -  Sequential Fixed Length Record (512 bytes/record)

 -  Sequential Fixed Length Record of a specified record size (from 1
    to 32767 bytes/record)

 Included with PATHWORKS V1.0 for OpenVMS (NetWare) is a feature called
 a hybrid user. This feature allows users who are both interactive Open-
 VMS users and users of PATHWORKS V1.0 for OpenVMS (NetWare) to access
 both their NetWare created information and their interactive OpenVMS
 user directory while logged in as a NetWare user.

 If identified as a hybrid user, when you log in to the file server,
 there is a special volume called HOME created. HOME points to your lo-
 gin directory of your OpenVMS account. You can map drives to this HOME
 volume and/or to directories below it. You have access rights to all
 files in that directory just as if you were logged in to your account
 on OpenVMS.

 Multiple DOS-based NetWare clients can concurrently access files stored
 on the server's disk through the file access modes and byte range lock-
 ing support provided by the server as defined by Novell's NCP proto-
 col.


                                  4


 

 Through the use of the VMS Lock Manager, OpenVMS and PC-based appli-
 cations can control file access.

 Print Services

 PATHWORKS V1.0 for OpenVMS (NetWare) software allows NetWare clients
 to share printers also used by other PATHWORKS clients and other Open-
 VMS users. Printers can be connected to a VAXserver, VAXcluster, or
 LAT-supported terminal servers in a LAN and allow DOS-based NetWare
 clients to send files to these remote printers.

 The system administrator assigns a service name to a OpenVMS print queue
 and can define user access to the print service. DOS-based NetWare client
 software can redirect printer I/O from a client printer port to a de-
 fined print service.

 The system administrator creates, on the host, the physical and generic
 queues as well as defines forms for selected Digital and third-party
 printers using normal OpenVMS commands. The administrator then uses
 the PATHWORKS V1.0 for OpenVMS (NetWare) SCONSOLE utility to associate
 print services with OpenVMS print queues. Refer to the Optional Hard-
 ware section in the SSA for details.

 Multiple print services may be set up for the same printer. For ex-
 ample, a landscape service and a portrait service may be created for
 the same PrintServer 40 Plus printer. In addition, other printer queues
 can be manually set to support additional Digital and third-party print-
 ers that are not listed in the menus.

 NetWare clients can also access other NetWare print services avail-
 able in the network either directly or via the PCONSOLE utility.

 Server Management and Control

 SCONSOLE, an OpenVMS Utility used in conjunction with standard Net-
 Ware client utilities, provides the complete set of tools needed to
 manage the PATHWORKS V1.0 for OpenVMS (NetWare) server.



                                  5


 

 SCONSOLE is used to manage OpenVMS-specific functions related to this
 product. In particular, SCONSOLE is used to:

 -  Start and stop the server, in its entirety or in part

 -  Create, modify, and remove volumes

 -  Associate NetWare print queues with OpenVMS print queues

 -  Modify server security settings

 -  Add and delete hybrid users

 -  Configure and tune server components

 -  Display server specific statistics and information

 Network Connectivity

 IPX/SPX

 The PATHWORKS V1.0 for OpenVMS (NetWare) software includes an Open-
 VMS implementation of the transport protocol's used by Novell's na-
 tive NetWare products

    IPX - Internetwork Packet Exchange
    SPX - Sequenced Packet Exchange

 IPX is delivered as a STREAMS driver in this product and is used for
 all NetWare related client/server functions. Whereas IPX is transmit-
 ted as datagram packets between source and destination, SPX sits on
 top of the IPX protocol tracking series of packets, ensuring that each
 packet is successfully received by its intended destination.

 Novell Virtual Terminal (NVT) Protocol

 NVT consists of a TSR (terminate and stay-resident) program for the
 client and a driver for OpenVMS that communicate over IPX to estab-
 lish a virtual terminal session on the OpenVMS host where the driver
 resides. A maximum of 1000 concurrent NVT sessions can be supported.

                                  6


 

 The NVT TSR is supported by the PATHWORKS V5.0 for DOS and Windows SETHOST
 terminal emulation program and is compatible with many third-party ter-
 minal emulation software packages.

 IPX Tunneling via DECnet

 PATHWORKS V1.0 for OpenVMS (NetWare) includes a capability of connect-
 ing one or more NetWare LANs using DECnet WAN. The tunnel driver en-
 capsulates IPX datagrams within DECnet packets transmitted across the
 DECnet network to the tunnel partner and then de-encapsulates the IPX
 datagram routing it to its intended destination.

 Mail Services

 The mail server component of PATHWORKS V1.0 for OpenVMS (NetWare) pro-
 vides a service that is separate and distinct from the NetWare file
 and print services. This mail utility is based on the OpenVMS MAIL-11
 product and requires DECnet as its communications transport. It al-
 lows PATHWORKS users, using the client PATHWORKS Mail software, to send
 and receive electronic mail messages without having to log in to the
 OpenVMS system as an interactive user.

 A mail account may be established on the OpenVMS server for each user.
 Mail can be sent to this account by other PATHWORKS Mail users as well
 as traditional users of OpenVMS mail software. The mail server then
 routes messages to the appropriate client when the user logs onto the
 server.

 The PATHWORKS V1.0 for OpenVMS (NetWare) mail server provides the PATH-
 WORKS user with folders, distribution lists, and delivery capabili-
 ties. Also, notification of new messages occurs both in realtime (which
 may be optionally disabled) and upon log in to a network MAIL session.

 Installation and Configuration

 PATHWORKS V1.0 for OpenVMS (NetWare) is installed on the VAX using the
 standard VMSINSTAL procedure. An Installation Verification Procedure
 (IVP) is also included, which can be used to confirm that the server
 software has been installed properly.

                                  7


 

 Digital recommends that a customer's first purchase of this software
 product at each site include Digital installation service. This ser-
 vice provides implementation support for customers installing PATH-
 WORKS V1.0 for OpenVMS (NetWare) software and for the integration of
 DOS workstations into the Digital network. Contact your local Digi-
 tal representative for information on the service options available.

 License Management

 PATHWORKS V1.0 for OpenVMS (NetWare) offers several license manage-
 ment capabilities related to both client-based and server-based li-
 censes.

 o  Client-based License Management

 PATHWORKS client licenses are provided as Product Authorization Keys
 (PAKs[1]) for the OpenVMS License Management Facility (LMF). These PAKs
 must an be loaded into the LMF database, using standard LMF procedures,
 on an OpenVMS system that is running the PATHWORKS V1.0 for OpenVMS
 (NetWare) software and which will be used as PATHWORKS License Server
 (see "1." below).

 The PATHWORKS V1.0 for OpenVMS (NetWare) software then provides two
 vital capabilities in support of PATHWORKS client license management:

    1. Included with the PATHWORKS V1.0 for OpenVMS (NetWare) software
       is a PATHWORKS License Server capability which, upon request from
       a client, will acquire a client license from the local LMF database,
       provide it to the client, and record the event. This PATHWORKS
       License Server is also used by the client to occasionally ver-
       ify that its license is still valid.

    2. There is also a PATHWORKS License Manager capability which pro-
       vides a system manager with the ability to monitor client li-
       cense usage. The PATHWORKS License Manager can also be used to
       preallocate licenses to specific groups of users and to reclaim
       a license from a client.

 ____________________

 PAK   stands for "Product Authorization Key"

                                  8


 

 Yet another capability in the server software, known as the License
 Registrar, will "handshake" with clients requesting access to server
 functions. Clients that can successfully "handshake" with the server
 and produce a valid client license will be allowed access to the ser-
 vices offered by PATHWORKS V1.0 for OpenVMS (NetWare).

 o  Server-based License Management

 The PATHWORKS V1.0 for OpenVMS (NetWare) is also capable of allowing
 client access based on a local server-based license. If a client re-
 questing access to the file server fails to present a valid client li-
 cense, the License Registrar software will then check the local LMF
 database for the availability of a PATHWORKS V1.0 for OpenVMS (Net-
 Ware) FPS license. If one is available, and the number of concurrently-
 connected clients allowed by the license has not been exceeded, the
 client will be allowed access.

 Note that both server-based and client-based license management are
 always active simultaneously on PATHWORKS V1.0 for OpenVMS (NetWare)
 servers. However, clients that do have a valid client-based license
 are already licensed to use the server software and, therefore, are
 not counted against the fixed number of clients granted access by the
 server-based FPS license.

 Restrictions and Limitations

 o  Version 3.01B

 This version of this product is an implementation of Portable NetWare,
 V3.01B. As such, certain features currently available in NetWare servers
 from Novell are not included. Among these features are:

    -  RPRINT - In particular, the absence of this feature means that
       interactive OpenVMS users will not have access to NetWare print
       queues.

    -  Packet Burst



                                  9


 

 o  The DOS utilities specific to PC hardware devices such as CHKDSK,
    FDISK, DISKCOPY, DISKCOMP and FORMAT cannot be used with PATHWORKS
    V1.0 for OpenVMS (NetWare) volumes.

 o  Wire Protocols

 Version 1.0 of PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) only supports Ether-
 net and Ethernet drivers. In particular, it does not support Token Ring,
 FDDI, or Arcnet.

 o  Ethernet Frame Type

 Version 1.0 of PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) only supports the Ethernet-
 II frame type. Note that though Novell V3.x and V2.x network clients
 default to use Novell's raw 802.3 frame format for Ethernet LANs, Nov-
 ell highly recommends the use of Ethernet-II frame type for these clients
 when operating in networks that include protocols other than IPX and
 SPX.

 o  The NetWare utility Salvage is not supported since it is not com-
    patible with the OpenVMS file system.

 o  Version 1.0 of PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) supports a maximum
    of 250 users per OpenVMS node.

 o  Version 1.0 of PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) supports a maximum
    of 64 NetWare volumes.

 o  Version 1.0 of PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) supports a maximum
    of 1000 NVT sessions.

 o  Version 1.0 of PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) will not operate with
    OpenVMS systems employing Symmetric Multiprocessing. Refer to the
    System Support Addendum (SSA 41.47.00-x) for exact information re-
    garding supported systems.

 SOFTWARE LICENSING AND ORDERING INFORMATION

 PATHWORKS V1.0 for OpenVMS (NetWare) can be licensed in two differ-
 ent ways.

 1. Client-based licensing (CCS & FPA)

 This product can be licensed for operation and access on any number
 of supported platforms to provide services to clients assigned appro-
 priate client-based licenses.

 See the attached PATHWORKS license terms and conditions for CCS (Sec-
 tion 1) and FPA (Section 2) licenses for a description of the specific
 rights granted.

 See the list below for applicable client license types and ordering
 information.

 2. Server-based licensing (FPS)

 A PATHWORKS FPS license for this product permits its use on a single
 supported platform and allows access by clients that do not have a PATH-
 WORKS client-based license.

 See the attached PATHWORKS License terms and conditions for "FPS" (Sec-
 tion 4) licenses for a description of the specific rights granted.

 See the list below for applicable ordering information.

 Note: These licensing options are not mutually exclusive. Differing lev-
 els of service required by a heterogeneous community of end-users could
 suggest the use of both licensing methods, simultaneously, for some
 environments.

 Clients with client-based licenses for server access do not interfere
 with the access of other clients that rely on server-based licensing
 for access to a particular server. The two licensing methods are de-
 signed to coexist.
