 Product Name:  MAILbus 400 Message Router Gateway      SPD 53.65.00
                for openVMS, Version 1.0

 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

 MAILbus 400[TM] Message Router Gateway (XMR) for OpenVMS[TM] VAX[TM]
 is one of the specialised tools and services required to facilitate
 the migration of users of the Digital[TM] MAILbus[TM] (Message Router)
 based E-Mail systems to MAILbus 400 Message Transfer Agent (MTA) based
 X.400 messaging environment.

 The Gateway is a layered software product that resides on an OpenVMS
 VAX system. XMR provides a direct connection between a MAILbus net-
 work served by Message Router and an X.400 mail system served by a MAIL-
 bus 400 Message Transfer Agent (MTA). It enables MAILbus based appli-
 cations, such as ALL-IN-1[TM] Integrated Office System (IOS), to ex-
 change mail with MAILbus 400 based applications, such as DEC[TM] MAILworks [TM]
 Server for OSF/1[R] AXP[TM].

 The Gateway normally performs address translation between MAILbus and
 O/R addresses using information held in the DEC X.500 Directory Ser-
 vice, which is used by the MTA. XMR is also able to deliver a message
 to a recipient when the originator has supplied, in the recipient's
 address, information specific to the receiving mail system; this ad-
 dress information being supplied in address attribute extensions avail-
 able to the sending system. If this information is not supplied, the
 Gateway will use the supplied address information to search the DEC
 X.500 Directory Service for the address translation for the receiv-
 ing mail system. If XMR is unable to find a translation, the message
 will be non-delivered. When the Gateway is processing non-actionable
 addresses, if a translation is not found in the Directory, the Gate-
 way will generate a replyable address based on the Gateway's own ad-
 dress.

 MAILbus 400 Message Router Gateway                    SPD 53.65.00
 for openVMS, Version 1.0

 The Gateway maps bodypart contents between the outbound bodypart type
 and the associated type in the receiving system. The mapping is based
 on a bodypart mapping table, which is customisable to allow the pre-
 ferred mappings to be modified, or added to, according to the types
 present in the mail system. XMR does not perform any conversion of the
 actual content data. MAILbus bodyparts with contents such as WPS-PLUS[TM],
 RMS (tagged as DDIF[TM]) or a PC format (for example, WordPerfect[TM]
 or Microsoft[R] Word) are transferred to the MAILbus 400 MTA as tagged
 Externally Defined bodyparts. Conversions are initiated by the MTA,
 which calls the appropriate CDA[TM] converter library, if required.
 In the reverse direction, the X.400 bodyparts are mapped into MAIL-
 bus bodyparts and tagged so that the appropriate viewer or converter
 can be automatically invoked by the receiving user agent or gateway.

 The Gateway communicates with the MAILbus 400 MTA using the X/Open[TM]
 XAPI interface, allowing access to all the features of the X.400 stan-
 dard. XMR only communicates with the MAILbus 400 MTA and not X.400 MTAs
 from other vendors. The Gateway communicates with Message Router us-
 ing the Message Router interface as documented in the Message Router
 Programmer's Kit. The Gateway must be located on the same OpenVMS VAX
 system as the MAILbus 400 MTA. The Gateway may be located either re-
 motely or locally to Message Router.

 The Compound Document Architecture (CDA) Converter Library is required
 for the MAILbus 400 MTA to convert the content of Message Router WPS-PLUS
 bodyparts, from ALL-IN-1 IOS, and DECdx[TM] bodyparts (for example,
 from Message Router/S (MRS) and Message Router/P (MRP) Gateways) to
 an X.400 bodypart type; the required CDA converter is currently only
 available on OpenVMS VAX. The DEC ODA Compound Document Architecture
 Gateway is required for the MAILbus 400 MTA to convert the content of
 Message Router RMS bodyparts when they contain DDIF data.

 To communicate with MAILbus and MAILbus 400 environments, the Gate-
 way uses DECnet[TM]/OSI[R] for OpenVMS and DEC X.500 Directory Ser-
 vice for directory services.

 Management

 XMR is managed according to the Digital model Enterprise Management
 Architecture (EMA), in the same way as the MAILbus 400 MTA. It can be
 managed from any DECnet/OSI node equipped with a suitable Director,
 such as NCL.

 Conformance to Standards

 The Gateway communicates with the MAILbus 400 MTA using the X/Open XAPI
 interface which is conformant to the X/Open CAE Specifications.
