          PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER Network Statistics Option, Version 1.4 SPD
                                  (formerly DECmcc Performance Statistics
          39.74.02                Package)

          INTRODUCTION

          POLYCENTER Network Statistics Option is one of several separately
          available packages of POLYCENTER Network Management Modules. These
          products provide management functions and protocol support for
          different network and system management environments. POLYCENTER
          Network Management Module Options can be installed and used
          separately or in any combination with the POLYCENTER Framework. The
          management services provided by newly installed modules are
          automatically enrolled in the POLYCENTER Framework and are available
          to management services already installed.

          POLYCENTER Framework software is the minimum prerequisite software
          product for POLYCENTER Network Management Module Options such as the
          Network Statistics Option. Please refer to the POLYCENTER Network
          Management Services Software Product Description (SPD 37.20.xx) for
          a list of the POLYCENTER Network Management products and module
          packages, and for a description of their relationship to each other
          and to the Digital Enterprise Management Architecture (EMA).

          DESCRIPTION

          The POLYCENTER Network Statistics Option calculates statistics for se-
          lected entity classes such as DECnet Phase IV and DECnet/OSI nodes,
          TCP/IP hosts, and Digital LAN Bridges. Information such as error
          counts, utilization percentages, and other statistical data can be
          collected, processed, and used to track network and device
          utilization. Used with the POLYCENTER Framework Notification Option,
          output from this package can be used to establish alarm thresholds.
          As numeric attributes,

                                        DIGITAL                  January 1995

                                                                  AE-PUBTD-TE

 



          POLYCENTER Network Statistics Option, Version 1.4     SPD 39.74.02
          (formerly DECmcc Performance Statistics Package)

          output from the POLYCENTER Network Statistics Option can be displayed
          as graphs or histograms in the Motif/Iconic Map PM Graph Window, or
          exported to an external relational database (using the POLYCENTER
          Framework Historian Option) for additional processing and report
          generation. The POLYCENTER Network Statistics Option also includes
          sample error and utilization reports for use with the POLYCENTER
          Historian Option.

          NOTE: Setup and printing of the sample reports requires the use of CDD
          /Repository, DATATRIEVE, and DECgraph on OpenVMS VAX systems, and IN-
          GRES[TM] Tools.

          IMPORTANT INTEROPERABILITY INFORMATION FOR OPENVMS USERS ONLY

          Interoperability problems may occur when more than one product con-
          taining DECthreads is installed on a system. This occurs because some
          products overwrite the system version of DECthreads. If a product with
          a different version of DECthreads is installed after POLYCENTER Frame-
          work, problems may occur.

          POLYCENTER Framework V1.4 is linked with DECthreads V1.0-422. Later
          versions of DECthreads have a backwards compatible API. Consequently,
          no problem should result from having a more recent version of
          DECthreads on the system.

          Only SSB versions of DECthreads are supported.

          SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS FOR OPENVMS

          For Systems Using Terminals (no DECwindows Motif interface):

          o  OpenVMS VAX Operating System V5.5-2 to V6.1

          o  POLYCENTER Framework V1.4

          For Workstations Running DECwindows Motif:

          o  OpenVMS VAX Operating System V5.5-2 to V6.1

          o  DECwindows Motif V1.1 for OpenVMS V5.5-2
             DECwindows Motif V1.2 for OpenVMS V6.1

          o  POLYCENTER Framework V1.4

          OpenVMS Tailoring

          For OpenVMS systems, the following OpenVMS classes are required for
