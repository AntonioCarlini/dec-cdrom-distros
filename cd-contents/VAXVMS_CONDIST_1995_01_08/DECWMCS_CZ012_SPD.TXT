           DESCRIPTION

           The DECwindows Motif OpenVMS User Interface/Cesky V1.2, as well as 
           the other language variants of the same product family, provides 
           DECwindows desktop environment (graphical user interface to the 
           OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS AXP operating systems) in the native 
           language.

           This means that all graphical user interface (GUI) components that 
           allow the user to interact with the operating system using the point-
           and-click technique, such as menus, dialog boxes, the messaging sys-
           tem, the help system and on-line documentation, appear in the native
           language.

           At the same time it extends and enhances the use of a base set of 
           desktop tools and desktop productivity applications, by 
           facilitating processing of the native language specific data.

           DECwindows Motif OpenVMS User Interface language variants also pro-
           vide a translated Motif toolkit, which allows users to develop pri-
           vate software applications in their native language.

           It supports a coexistence of different language variants on the same
           computing system, with the possibility of changing easily from one 
           language to another, by setting a user defined language resource.

           Supported Languages

           DECwindows Motif OpenVMS User Interface language variants support the
           following European languages:

           Czech, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Russian, Slovak,
           Spanish, and Swedish.

           DECwindows Motif[R] OpenVMS User Interface/Cesky Version 1.2 
           SPD 47.14.02


           The DECwindows Motif OpenVMS User Interface/Cesky V1.2 consists of 
           four basic components:

           Session Manager

           Session Manager provides the top-level user interface to a DECwindows
           workstation in the native language. From Session Manager, users can
           start applications, customize their session and perform security man-
           agement. On a multiple language variants system, Session Manager also
           allows users to change the user interface language from one to 
           another, making it possible to run applications simultaneously in 
           different languages inside the same DECwindows session.

           The user interface language of the Session Manager itself cannot be
           changed without closing the DECwindows session and opening it again.

           Window Manager

           Window Manager allows the user to control the size and position of 
           windows and to customize the workspace or screen colours. To change
           the Window Manager User Interface language on the multiple language
           variants system, the user should select a language from the Session
           Manager, then restart Window Manager. Window Manager User Interface 
           language will not follow subsequent language changes and will 
           remain in the language chosen until the next restart.

           FileView

           Translated FileView allows the user to interact with the OpenVMS sys-
           tem by navigating inside the file system and performing basic oper-
           ations on files without knowing the command language. It is possible
           to run several FileViews simultaneously inside the same DECwindows 
           session, but not in different languages. The FileView user 
           interface always remains in the language which was current when the
           DECwindows session was opened.

           DECterm Terminal Emulator

           The locale version of DECterm terminal emulator provides the user 
           with a translated DECterm user interface, as well as with the 
           capability to display a native language specific characters.

           Desktop Productivity Applications

           DECwindows Motif OpenVMS User Interface/Cesky provides a translated
           set of integrated desktop applications that employ a common look and
           feel, to help users easily master their computing environment.

           All desktop applications, listed in the DECwindows Motif OpenVMS V1.2
           Software Product Description (SPD 42.19.01), are also available in 
           DECwindows Motif OpenVMS User Interface/Cesky Version 1.2.

           Processors Not Supported

           For performance reasons, DECwindows Motif OpenVMS VAX Version 1.2 is
           not supported on the following processors:

           MicroVAX II, MicroVAX 2000, VAXstation II,
           VAXstation 2000, VAX-11/725, VAX-11/782,
           VAXstation 8000, VAX-11/730, VAX-11/780, VAX-11/785

           Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1)

           The disk space figures specified below refer to the disk space 
           required for Czech language variant installation, assuming that all 
           prerequisite software is already installed. Two different values are
           listed for language variant installations that require a different 
           amount of space when installing on AXP or (VAX). The size of the 
           other language variant kits may vary depending on the language and 
           on the code set supported by the language concerned (some language 
           variant kits must include language specific fonts that are 
           not installed with the standard DECwindows Motif product).

           The following values are required for installation and use of the 
           DECwindows Motif OpenVMS User Interface/Cesky V1.2:

           Disk space required for     54,000 blocks (38,000 blocks)
           installation:

           Disk space required for     53,000 blocks (37,000 blocks)
           use (permanent):

	   In case of multiple installation of LNE1 language variants on the
           same system (LNE1 is the common abbreviation for "Latin Not 
           Equal 1"), the number of disk blocks required during and after 
           installation may vary according to the following table:

           Subsequent LNE1 LV installation:		18,000 blocks

	   Disk space required for use (permanent) 
	   after subsequent installation:		17,000 blocks

           Memory Requirements for OpenVMS AXP and VAX Systems

           Memory Requirements for OpenVMS AXP Systems

           The minimum amount of memory required for a system user to install,
           boot, and log in to an OpenVMS AXP system running DECwindows Motif 
           OpenVMS (AXP) User Interface/Cesky V1.2 is 32 MB. Remote execution 
           of applications requires an additional system to run the 
           application while the application is displayed on the user's 
           workstation.

           The performance and memory usage of OpenVMS AXP systems running
           DECwindows Motif OpenVMS (AXP) User Interface/Cesky V1.2 depend on 
           the system configuration and window and applications usage.

           Memory Requirements for OpenVMS VAX Systems

           The minimum amount of memory required for a system user to install,
           boot, and log in to an OpenVMS VAX system running DECwindows Motif 
           OpenVMS (VAX) User Interface/Cesky is 12MB; 16MB is highly 
           recommended for a more robust performance. Remote execution of 
           applications requires an additional system to run the application 
           while the application is displayed on the user's workstation.

           The performance and memory usage of OpenVMS VAX systems running 
           DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS VAX depend on system configuration and 
           window and applications usage.
