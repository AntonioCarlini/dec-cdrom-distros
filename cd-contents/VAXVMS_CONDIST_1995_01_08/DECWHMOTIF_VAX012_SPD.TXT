           PRODUCT NAME:  DECwindows Motif[R]/Hebrew Version 1.2   SPD 46.55.01
                          for OpenVMS

           This Software Product Description describes the following two 
           products:

           o  DECwindows Motif/Hebrew for OpenVMS VAX Version 1.2

           o  DECwindows Motif/Hebrew for OpenVMS AXP Version 1.2

           The general description section describes features common to both 
           products. Any differences in product functionality are indicated in 
           separate sections that follow.

           DESCRIPTION

           DECwindows Motif/Hebrew for OpenVMS is the Hebrew language variant 
           support for the base DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS. The product 
           provides Hebrew keyboard and font support.

           The DECwindows desktop environment provides a graphical user inter-
           face to the OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS AXP operating systems. DECwindows
           incorporates the Open Software Foundation's Motif user interface as
           the design center for DECwindows applications. OSF/Motif[R] is a 
           graphical user interface widely acknowledged as the industry 
           standard. This interface allows users to interact with the OpenVMS 
           VAX and OpenVMS
           AXP operating systems using a point-and-click technique. DECwindows
           includes a set of integrated desktop applications that demonstrate 
           the ease-of-use of this user interface and provides OpenVMS AXP 
           users with a base set of desktop tools.

           DECwindows Motif/Hebrew Version 1.2 for OpenVMS supports both the 
           DECwindows X User Interface (XUI) and the Motif Window Manager.

           The DECwindows Motif/Hebrew for OpenVMS user environment consists of
           four basic components:

           1. Session Manager
              Session Manager provides the top-level user interface to a 
              DECwindows workstation. From Session Manager, users can start 
              applications, customize their session, and perform security 
              management. Session Manager also lets users specify the language 
              user interface for supported DECwindows applications if they have
              ordered, installed, and are licensed to use the appropriate 
              DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS language variant kit(s). For the 
              supported language variants, refer to the DECwindows Motif 
              OpenVMS User Interface Product SPD.
              Session Manager is not available in Hebrew user interface, but it
              enables activation of Hebrew applications.

           2. Window Manager
              The Window Manager lets users control the size and placement of 
              windows. The OSF/Motif Window Manager is provided as the default 
              window manager; users can choose instead to work with the 
              DECwindows X User Interface (XUI) Window Manager. The window 
              manager can be chosen by an individual user or by a system 
              manager for an entire system.

           3. FileView
              FileView, a graphical interface to the OpenVMS file system, allows
              users to navigate the file system and to perform operations on 
              files.

           4. DECterm Terminal Emulator
              The DECterm terminal emulator provides workstation users with a 
              traditional character-cell interface for existing OpenVMS 
              features and applications. It is a VT320 terminal emulator, which
              simulates also the Hebrew functionality of VT100-, VT220- and 
              VT320-class terminals. It supports ReGIS and sixel, but is not 
              fully VT340 compatible. Programs written for VT52-, VT100-, 
              VT220-, or VT320-class terminals and using OpenVMS terminal 
              driver features operate without modification in this workstation 
              window. DECterm also provides workstation-oriented features, such
              as mouse-based cursor positioning, variable screen sizes, and 
              cutting and pasting of text between DECterm and other DECwindows 
              applications. Many programs can also use these features without 
              modification.

           Desktop Productivity Applications

           DECwindows Motif/Hebrew for OpenVMS provides a set of integrated 
           desktop applications that employ a common look and feel to help 
           users easily master their computing environment.

           The desktop applications, listed in the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS
           V1.2 Software Product Description (SPD 42.19.xx), are also available
           in DECwindows Motif/Hebrew for OpenVMS Version 1.2. However, these 
           applications are not available in Hebrew user interface. Hebrew text
           input is supported only in Cardfiler, Paint and Calendar 
           applications.

           The DECwindows Motif/Hebrew for OpenVMS Help System

           The DECwindows Motif Help System uses the familiar Bookreader inter-
           face to display Help and to retrieve Help information. This Help sys-
           tem includes a Table of Contents and cross-referencing through the 
           use of hotspots.

           Apart from some basic topics which were translated into Hebrew, all
           the help text is in English. The Hebrew help text is available only
           via the help widget, and cannot be used with Bookreader.

           HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

           DECwindows Motif/Hebrew runs on any of the supported processors, but
           requires either a workstation, a DOS-based PC, a Macintosh[R] or an

           Processor Restrictions

           The DECwindows Motif/Hebrew for OpenVMS product runs on any of the 
           supported processors, but requires a display device such as a 
           workstation, a DOS-based PC, or a Macintosh[R] using a supported 
           transport protocol. These display devices must be running an 
           X Window System, Version 11, Release 4 or later compliant display 
           server.

           Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1)

           Memory Requirements for OpenVMS AXP and VAX Systems

           Memory Requirements for OpenVMS AXP Systems

           The minimum amount of memory required for a system user to install,
           boot, and log in to an OpenVMS AXP system running DECwindows 
           Motif/Hebrew for OpenVMS AXP is 32 MB. Remote execution of 
           applications requires an additional system that runs the 
           application while the application is displayed on the local 
           workstation.

           The performance and memory usage of OpenVMS AXP systems running 
           DECwindows Motif/Hebrew for OpenVMS AXP depend on system 
           configuration and window and applications usage.

           Memory Requirements for OpenVMS VAX Systems

           The minimum amount of memory required for a system user to install,
           boot, and log in to an OpenVMS VAX system running DECwindows 
           Motif/Hebrew for OpenVMS VAX is 12MB; 16MB is highly recommended for
           more robust performance. Remote execution of applications requires 
           an additional system that runs the application while the 
           application is displayed on the local workstation.

           The performance and memory usage of OpenVMS VAX systems running 
           DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS VAX depend on system configuration and 
           window and applications usage.

           SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

           DECwindows Motif/Hebrew Version 1.2 for OpenVMS is supported on the
           following operating systems:
              OpenVMS VAX Version 5.5-2, Version 6.0, and Version 6.1
              OpenVMS AXP Version 1.5 and Version 6.1

           and should be installed on top of DECwindows Motif Version 1.2 for 
           OpenVMS, US version.

           GROWTH CONSIDERATIONS

           The minimum hardware/software requirements for any future version of
           this product may be different from the requirements for the current
           version.
