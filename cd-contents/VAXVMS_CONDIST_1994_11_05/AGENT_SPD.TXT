 PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER System Watchdog Agent        SPD 41.43.00
                for OpenVMS[*], Version 1.0

 DESCRIPTION

 The POLYCENTER System Watchdog Agent for OpenVMS is an OpenVMS lay-
 ered product that helps Information Systems personnel manage computer-
 related problems that occur in OpenVMS systems interconnected by a wide
 area network. Operating in conjunction with the POLYCENTER System Watch-
 dog Consolidator for OpenVMS, it gives operators and system managers
 the ability to monitor potential problem conditions from many dispersed
 systems at a single terminal. This enables the operations staff to be-
 come aware of such potential problems quickly and correct them as early
 as possible.

 Each POLYCENTER System Watchdog Agent monitors the system on which it
 resides and may be polled for problem reports by one or more POLYCEN-
 TER System Watchdog Consolidators, which may be located locally or at
 a geographically remote site in a wide area network.

 The POLYCENTER System Watchdog Agent scans periodically for the fol-
 lowing events:

 o  processor stopped

 o  cpu errors

 o  memory errors

 o  ethernet errors

 o  disk errors

 o  hsc problems

 ____________________

 The   terms VMS and OpenVMS refer to the OpenVMS operating system.

 o  ci cable problems

 o  disabled memory

 o  process looping

 o  disk state problems

 o  disk software write-locked

 o  device queue state problems

 o  batch queue state problems

 o  queue manager problems

 The POLYCENTER System Watchdog Agent can also check for the follow-
 ing events when a POLYCENTER System Watchdog Consolidator sends it a
 request that supplies the required thresholds and other parameters:

 o  printer/device queue stalled

 o  disk near full

 o  shadow set problems

 o  missing process

 o  missing batchjob

 o  login limit too low

 The POLYCENTER System Watchdog Agent also adds and deletes "external"
 event messages, i.e., events with user-supplied text that are reported
 to the POLYCENTER System Watchdog Agent by user commands or by soft-
 ware applications running on the node it is monitoring.

 Software Components

 POLYCENTER System Watchdog Agent for OpenVMS consists of the follow-
 ing components:

 o  SNS$WATCHDOG is a detached process that runs on each OpenVMS node
    to be monitored by the POLYCENTER System Watchdog Consolidator. It

                                  2

 

    periodically scans various devices and data structures on that Open-
    VMS system. If it detects a condition that is considered to be ab-
    normal, an event message is generated in a local list of messages.
    If the abnormal condition disappears, the message is removed from
    the list. SNS$WATCHDOG responds with its current list of event mes-
    sages whenever polled by an authorized SNS$CONSOLIDATOR program.

 o  SNS$CONTROL is an interactive process that provides commands to add
    and delete external messages to the local problem list (list of event
    messages) maintained by SNS$WATCHDOG.

 o  SNS$SHR is a shareable image containing the routines SNS$ADD_MESSAGE
    and SNS$DELETE_MESSAGE. SNS$ADD_MESSAGE adds an external message
    to the list of event messages maintained by the SNS$WATCHDOG on a
    specified node. SNS$DELETE_MESSAGE removes an external message from
    the specified SNS$WATCHDOG list.
