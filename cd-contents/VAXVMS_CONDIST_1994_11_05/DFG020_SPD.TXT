 PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER File Optimizer               SPD 36.21.03
                for OpenVMS VAX, Version 2.0

 DESCRIPTION

 The POLYCENTER File Optimizer (formerly named DEC File Optimizer) for
 OpenVMS VAX is a layered software product which reduces both file frag-
 mentation and freespace fragmentation and optimizes file placement on
 disk media. This results in better application performance, better backup
 performance, and more efficient disk utilization. POLYCENTER File Op-
 timizer operates in two modes. In "Defrag PLUS" mode, DEC Rdb Run-Time
 is used as a database of scheduling information, and defragmentation
 jobs can be scheduled using a wide variety of scheduling criteria. In
 normal "Defrag" mode, defragmentation jobs are run when requested by
 the user. "Defrag" mode requires much less disk space than "Defrag PLUS",
 which makes it ideal for workstations or smaller systems which have
 less demanding disk utilization requirements. The user or system man-
 ager can specify which of these two modes should be used when the prod-
 uct is installed.

 The key capabilities of the POLYCENTER File Optimizer for OpenVMS VAX
 are:

 o  Reduces file fragmentation and freespace fragmentation for disk de-
    vices

 o  Provides the ability to defragment specific files or an entire disk

 o  Gives the user the capability to select or exclude specific files
    based on:

    -  User choice

    -  Severity of fragmentation

    -  Whether the file has placement pointers

    -  Whether the files are indexed

 o  Provides event based scheduling of defragmentation jobs

 o  Provides a Monitor function which allows File Optimizer processes
    to be monitored while in operation

 o  Allows pre- and post-processing commands to effect automation of
    tasks before and after defragmentation jobs are executed

 o  Gives the user the ability to classify files as "hot" (frequently
    accessed), or "cold" (infrequently accessed) and to have them placed
    on the disk drive accordingly

 o  Provides two modes of operation to tailor to the specific customer
    environment

 o  Offers a choice of Digital Command Line (DCL) or Motif[R]-based Graph-
    ical User Interfaces. This is available for both Defrag and Defrag
    PLUS modes.
