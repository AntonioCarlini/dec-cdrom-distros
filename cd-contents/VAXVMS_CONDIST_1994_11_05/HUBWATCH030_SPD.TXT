 PRODUCT NAME:  HUBwatch for OpenVMS VAX, Version 3.0   SPD 45.74.02

 DESCRIPTION

 HUBwatch for OpenVMS VAX is a layered product on OpenVMS VAX that is de-
 signed to manage Digital's DEChub family of products. It can be installed 
 in one of two ways:

 o  As an add-on application to POLYCENTER products for OpenVMS VAX

 o  As a standalone application with OpenVMS VAX, DEC TCP/IP Services for
    OpenVMS VAX or TGV MultiNet(R), Bookreader, and OpenVMS VAX DECwindows 
    Motif(R)

 The HUBwatch application is a flexible SNMP management tool that runs in 
 the Motif windows environment.  The graphical user interface (GUI) allows 
 you to configure DEChubs and GIGAswitch, and to view the status and activity 
 of Hub modules and GIGAswitch components. Award winning context sensitive 
 help is available on every screen.

 The enhancements to HUBwatch V3.0 include:
	- Support for these new DEChub Modules: 
		DECrepeater 900GM	DECbridge 900MX
		DECrepeater 900FP	DECconcentrator 900MX
		DECrepeater 90FS
	- GIGAswitch Support
	- "Traps"-based Alarms feature
	- "Find Address" and "Find Duplicate Address" for Ethernet stations
	- FDDI LAN Interconnect support

 The HUBwatch application is invoked either by selecting an icon on a
 POLYCENTER network map or as a standalone application. A DECwindows
 Motif window displays the front panel view of the selected device. 

 The Hub Front Panel window display includes the hub configuration and 
 status of each module and module port. HUBwatch for OpenVMS VAX incorporates 
 both a Physical and Logical hub front panel view. The Physical View depicts 
 an exact representation of the hub's front panel. The Logical Hub View 
 provides the same technical data, but uses a standard module template with  
 labels and icons to distinguish module types. Both views, physical and 
 logical, provide for access to hub module management windows and options. 

 To access hub module management windows, "double click" on a module in 
 the Hub Front Panel window. Both the graphical Physical and Logical hub 
 views have "hot-spots," such as the port connectors. Another window will 
 be opened, containing information and controls that are specific to that 
 module or port.
 
 HUBwatch uses SNMP to manage the DEChub 900MS, DEChub 90, DEChub One and
 GIGAswitch products. These products include:

 	DECrepeater 90C	   	DECserver 90L     DECbridge 90  
        DECrepeater 90T	   	DECserver 90L+    DECbridge 90FL     
	DECrepeater 90T+  	DECserver 90TL    DECbridge 900MX  
	DECrepeater 90FA   	DECserver 90M     DECbrouter 90T1 	
	DECrepeater 90FL   	DECserver 900TM   DECbrouter 90T2
	DECrepeater 90FS   	DECagent 90	  DECbrouter 90T2A
	DECrepeater 900FP  	DEChub 900MS	  DECconcentrator 900MX	
	DECrepeater 900GM  	GIGAswitch
	DECrepeater 900TM	

 HUBwatch uses SNMP agents to manage the DEChub and GIGAswitch products. An 
 SNMP Agent is an entity in a hardware device that executes SNMP requests. 
 The following hardware devices contain integral SNMP Agents that are managed
 by HUBwatch.

		- DEChub 900MS   	- DECrepeater 900TM 
		- DECagent 90		- DECrepeater 900GM
		- DECserver 90TL	- DECrepeater 900FP
		- DECserver 90M		- DECrepeater 90FS
		- DECserver 900TM	- DECconcentrator 900MX
		- DECbridge 900MX	- DECbrouter 90T1, 90T2, 90T2A
		- GIGAswitch

 HUBwatch manages SNMP agents which have been identified in the HUBwatch 
 Agents file. The Agent Summary window allows the user to add and delete 
 SNMP agents and modify operating information for the Agent.

 Management of a DEChub 90 requires a DECagent 90 on the LAN, and a bus
 master services module in the DEChub 90. A bus master services module 
 may be a DECbridge 90, DECbridge 90FL or DECagent 90 running V2.0 firmware.
 Using bus master services, DEChub 90 slot information can be displayed 
 through HUBwatch.
 
 The DECagent 90 SNMP agent is required to provide SNMP interface between 
 HUBwatch for DEChub 90 modules installed in a DEChub 90. The HUBwatch 
 program displays the hub configuration on the Front Panel View, showing
 the status of modules and ports at a glance. HUBwatch uses the infor-
 mation in the DECagent 90's database to display hub configurations. 

 Basic management of the DECagent 90 is also available through its setup 
 port. The setup port of the DECagent 90 further enables the user to turn 
 DECrepeater 90 ports on and off, and remote MOP management of DECbridges, 
 DECservers and DECrepeater 90s (through a DECbridge). MOP management is 
 not available for the DECrepeater 90FS. The DECagent 90 setup can also
 be accessed via a Serial Line IP (SLIP) connection.

 Management of the DEChub 900MS requires an IP Services module to be 
 installed and identified in the DEChub 900MS. Modules that currently 
 provide IP Services are:
	DECrepeater 90FS	DECbridge 900MX	
	DECrepeater 900TM	DECconcentrator 900MX
	DECrepeater 900FP	DECrepeater 900GM

 DEChub 90 repeater modules installed in a DEChub 900MS can be managed either 
 "90 Style" or "900 Style". "90 Style" management emulates DEChub 90 
 management, and requires a DECagent 90 and bus master services. "900 Style" 
 management uses the IETF compliant MIBs and the DEChub 900MS Hub Manager. 
 HUBwatch screens supporting the IETF compliant MIBs are displayed, but the 
 non-applicable functions for the particular DEChub 90 repeater module are 
 disabled. No additional management features are available for the DEChub 90 
 repeater modules managed "900 Style", but the requirement of the DECagent 90 
 and bus master services is eliminated.

 DEChub One, or standalone management, is limited to those products with 
 integral SNMP management agents, and to the DECbridge 90, DECbridge 90FL 
 and DECserver 90L+, providing there is a DECagent 90 on the same extended 
 LAN. 

 The following modules are displayed with a front bezel only. No module 
 management is available for these products.
	DECwanrouter 90		DECmau 900TL
	MUXserver 90      	DECrepeater 900TL
	DECpacketprobe 90	DECrepeater 900SL

 HUBwatch manages the DECbrouter 90 by displaying a module summary screen
 and affording the user an ability to create a Telnet session to the device.

 Full management of modules is available through the Module Summary and 
 associated detail level screens. In general, DEChub module management 
 incorporates a Module Summary screen, and one or more detail level screens. 
 The Summary screen displays administrative information and summary 
 operational status of the module. The user may enter some customized 
 descriptive information, such as location. Some modules display summary 
 operations data, such as traffic summary data. Access to detail level 
 screens is available by double clicking on the appropriate port or button. 

 Full graphical management of the DEChub 900MS is also available through its
 Out-of-Band port. The Out-of-Band management port on the DEChub 900MS 
 requires SNMP to be run over a SLIP (Serial Line IP) connection. The SLIP 
 connection is established by connecting a terminal server that supports SLIP, 
 such as the DEcserver 900TM, to the DEChub 900MS. A SLIP connection from 
 the terminal server port to the out-of-band port on the DEChub 900MS 
 provides the necessary communications path. HUBwatch can communicate  
 out-of-band through the terminal server, which forwards the SNMP packet 
 through its SLIP port to the Hub Manager. HUBwatch for Windows V2.0, a
 companion software product, also provides a SLIP networking capability 
 for MS-Windows users. 

 The addition, deletion and modification of communities is accomplished in 
 the Community Table window.  

 Using the DECagent 90, one to sixty four communities can be managed, one of 
 which will always be the community in which the DECagent 90 resides. However, 
 practical limits are much lower and are performance dependent. For hubs that 
 contain only bridge and repeater modules, Digital recommends that there be 
 one DECagent 90 for every sixteen single hubs or every 8 double hubs. For hubs 
 that contain terminal servers, the maximum number of modules managed by one 
 DECagent 90 should not exceed 64. 

 The DEChub 900MS Hub Manager restricts communities to the local DEChub 900MS
 backplane. A single hub can have one to nine communities. Modules installed 
 in a DEChub 900MS that have their own SNMP agent would also be assigned a 
 unique community name. 

 The DEChub 900MS has multiple flexible channels that can be used to create 
 independent LAN segments. HUBwatch allows you to create and delete the LAN 
 segments from the LAN Interconnect window. LAN segments are assigned a name, 
 and technology type, using a menu. HUBwatch Version 3.0 supports the 
 creation and deletion of additional Ethernet and FDDI LAN segments. At this 
 time, available DEChub 900 modules only utilize 6 Ethernet flexible channels.

 Modules or ports may be connected to different LAN segments by "dragging" 
 (via the mouse) the desired connection to the appropriate LAN segment. 
 Safeguards are implemented to prevent inappropriate LAN connections. Modules
 with the capability to interconnect more than four ports (eg. DECbridge 
 900MX) have an associated Lan Interconnect Expanded View screen to display 
 and connect all ports. The Station Configuration View is used to configure
 ports between the front panel and the DEChub backplane for the DECbridge 900MX
 and the DECconcentrator 900MX. The Grouping View is used with the DECrepeater
 900FP to group ports onto different LANs.

 "Find Address" and "Find Duplicate Addresses" are functions that search 
 across all Agents defined in the HUBwatch Agents file for stations connected 
 to a managed Ethernet repeater. 

 Alarmed Agents that can be monitored by the HUBwatch alarms software may 
 be specified for Trap conditions. Traps occur when the module's firmware 
 monitors the hardware for specific faults and an alarm message is sent to 
 HUBwatch's monitoring software. Alarm management windows allow the user to 
 start and stop the Alarms Poller, display alarms and the alarms log file, 
 and add, delete and modify alarm agents.
	
 Traps supported in HUBWatch V3.0 are described in Table 1.

	   information about a change of an FDDI port. Disabled by default.
 

 HUBwatch manages the GIGAswitch with the same intuitive "look and feel". 
 From the Community Table, the GIGAswitch agent is selected, and the front 
 panel is displayed. Note that there is only a Physical Front Panel View for 
 the GIGAswitch. The eight management windows allow the user to perform 
 full management of the switch. In addition to the Summary Front Panel and 
 System Summary Views, detail screens allow the user to manage line cards, 
 MAC Information and port details.  Other screens enable filtering, and 
 management of line card and bridge functions. Using SNMP, setting filters 
 can be a complex and time consuming task. HUBwatch simplifies this task 
 through the use of an innovative GUI.

 The minimum recommended memory size is 24 Mbytes. The HUBwatch pro-
 gram supports 8-plane color monitors in "pseudocolor" mode only.

 DECagent 90 V2.0 (which serves as SNMP agent for HUBwatch) installed on the 
 LAN  and a Bus Master Device (DECbridge 90, DECbridge 90FL at V3.1 of 
 firmware or DECagent 90 at V2.0 of firmware) installed in the DEChub 90 
 to manage these devices:

 o  DECrepeater 90C, 90T, 90T+, 90FA, 90FL, installed in a DEChub 90 only. 
    The DEChub 900MS integral agent can manage these devices when installed
    in a DEChub 900MS. These devices are not manageable when not installed
    in a hub.

 o  DECserver 90L, 90L+ (Note: The DEChub 900MS Agent will not perform bus
    master for these devices when installed in a DEChub 900MS. A Bus Master
    Device is required to be installed in the same hub as these servers to 
    display slot information. A DECagent 90 is required on the LAN in order 
    to manage these devices. )

 o  DECbridge 90, 90FL (Note: The DEChub 900MS Agent will not perform bus
    master for these devices when installed in a DEChub 900MS. A DECagent 90 
    is required on the LAN in order to manage these devices. )
