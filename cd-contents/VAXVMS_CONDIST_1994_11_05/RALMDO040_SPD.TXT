   PRODUCT NAME:   DEC RALLY Version 4.0 for OpenVMS VAX Systems   SPD
   27.03.12

   DESCRIPTION

   DEC RALLY is Digital's fourth-generation application generator for the
   development of DEC Rdb applications. Applications developed with RALLY
   can be run as time-sharing applications on OpenVMS systems or as client/server
   applications using MS-DOS[R] or Microsoft[R] Windows[TM] clients with
   OpenVMS servers.

   DEC RALLY supports the RAD (Rapid Application Development) style of
   development, where the goal is to develop applications quickly and meet
   end-user needs without rework. Object-based and event-driven, RALLY
   makes it possible for you to develop complex applications with a min-
   imum amount of coding.

   DEC RALLY for OpenVMS VAX provides software for developing and deploy-
   ing RALLY applications on OpenVMS VAX systems. The applications can
   be interchanged with DEC RALLY systems on other platforms using the
   following related Digital software products:

   o  OpenVMS AXP, development and run-time systems-Refer to the DEC RALLY
      for OpenVMS AXP Software Product Description, SPD 51.26.xx.

   o  MS-DOS, run-time client only-Refer to the DEC RALLY for MS-DOS Soft-
      ware Product Description, SPD 37.62.xx.

   o  Microsoft Windows, run-time client only-Refer to the DEC RALLY for
      Microsoft Windows Product Description, SPD 60.32.xx.

   Two development systems are available. The DEC RALLY Motif[R] Devel-
   opment Option provides a high-productivity graphical interface for de-
   velopment of applications. This interface can be used either on Mo-
   tif workstations or on Windows PC clients via Digital's eXcursion soft-
   ware. The DEC RALLY Motif Development Option includes both the Motif
   and the character cell development systems.

   DEC RALLY Implementation Differences

   The database builder tool is available only on the OpenVMS VAX plat-
   form.

   None of the builder tools or utilities, with the exception of the Ver-
   ify utility, can be accessed through the Motif interface. These tools
   and utilities can be run via the character cell development system which
   is included with the DEC RALLY Motif Development Option.

   Internationalization

   DEC RALLY can be tailored for various languages. Conditional form/report
   text can display different labels for different users. Standard er-
   ror messages are provided in English, French, Spanish, German, Dan-
   ish, Swedish, Turkish, Hebrew, Dutch and Italian. Individual users can
   use different languages on the same machine.
