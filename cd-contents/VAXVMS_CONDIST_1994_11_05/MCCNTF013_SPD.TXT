 PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER Framework Notification Option, Version 1.3
 SPD 39.75.01                (formerly DECmcc Notification Package)

 INTRODUCTION

 POLYCENTER Framework Notification Option is one of several separately
 available packages of POLYCENTER Network Management Modules. These prod-
 ucts provide management functions and protocol support for different
 network and system management environments. POLYCENTER Network Man-
 agement Module Options can be installed and used separately or in any
 combination with the POLYCENTER Framework. The management services pro-
 vided by newly installed modules are automatically enrolled in the POLY-
 CENTER Framework and are available to management services already in-
 stalled.

 POLYCENTER Framework software is the minimum prerequisite software prod-
 uct for POLYCENTER Network Management Module Options such as the No-
 tification Option. Please refer to the POLYCENTER Network Management
 Services Software Product Description (SPD 37.20.xx) for a list of the
 POLYCENTER Network Management products and module options, and for a
 description of their relationship to each other and to the Digital En-
 terprise Management Architecture (EMA).

 DESCRIPTION

 The POLYCENTER Framework Notification Option consists of Management
 Modules that provide alarm and notification functions. It enables users
 to define states or conditions that must be monitored for fault man-
 agement.

 Users can write alarm rules for any managed object or, with wildcard-
 ing, multiple objects in the same class, for which there is a corre-
 sponding Access Module (AM). Alarm rules can be based on state changes,
 simple arithmetic expressions, or occurrences (unsolicited events).
 Users can request notifications of events such as alarm firing, DEC-
 net events, SNMP traps, and data collector events. Users can direct
 notification to icons representing devices other than the device gen-
 erating the event.

 There are a number of operator notification methods available, includ-
 ing:

 o  An Event/Alarm Log and a Notification Window that allow users to
    define event or alarm conditions they want to view and save. With
    the Notification Window, users can set up event filters, store and
    display event or alarm messages, and obtain additional detail as
    needed. Users can search for and display messages by specifying sever-
    ity level, date and time, managed object, and keywords.

 o  Map notification within the Motif(R)/Iconic Map PM. This function al-
    lows users to set up notifications within the iconic map that change
    the color of an icon or icons. Users can assign specific colors to
    severity levels and select defaults that display either the most
    recent or the most severe alarms.

 o  Trigger ULTRIX shell scripts or OpenVMS DCL command procedures. With
    such procedures, users can set up notification methods including
    terminal broadcast messages or electronic mail. In addition, fault
    isolation, testing, recovery, and other common operator functions
    can be automated using command procedures triggered by alarm rules.
