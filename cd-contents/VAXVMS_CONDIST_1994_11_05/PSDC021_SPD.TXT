 PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER Performance Data Collector    SPD 36.02.03
                for OpenVMS, Version 2.1

 OVERVIEW OF THE PRODUCT FAMILY

 POLYCENTER Performance Solution is a family of OpenVMS and U*IX lay-
 ered products that reduces the time and effort required to manage and
 monitor system performance, as well as plan for future resource re-
 quirements. The POLYCENTER Performance Solution products can be used
 with standalone OpenVMS, MIPS[TM] ULTRIX, DEC OSF/1[R] AXP, and clus-
 tered systems.

 The POLYCENTER Performance Solution products (formerly known as DECper-
 formance Solution, or DECps) include:

 o  POLYCENTER Performance Data Collector for OpenVMS gathers and man-
    ages OpenVMS system data (described in this SPD).

 o  POLYCENTER Performance Solution for UNIX[R] is Digital Equipment
    Corporation's solution for performance data collection and display
    on heterogeneous UNIX systems (SPD 46.97.xx).

 o  POLYCENTER Performance Advisor for OpenVMS analyzes OpenVMS data
    through the application of expert system technology. It identifies
    specific performance problems, presents detailed supporting evi-
    dence, and makes recommendations to improve system performance (SPD
    36.03.xx).

 o  POLYCENTER Capacity Planner predicts OpenVMS system performance lev-
    els for various workloads and configurations (SPD 36.04.xx).

 o  POLYCENTER Accounting Chargeback for OpenVMS VAX generates a re-
    port of charges based on OpenVMS system resource utilization and
    user specified resource pricing (SPD 36.60.xx).

 POLYCENTER Performance Data Collector for
 OpenVMS

 The POLYCENTER Performance Data Collector provides performance data
 collection, archiving, reporting, PC sampling, and a file activity dis-
 play for OpenVMS systems. Data collected by the POLYCENTER Performance
 Data Collector on VAX and AXP systems can be analyzed by the POLYCEN-
 TER Performance Advisor and POLYCENTER Capacity Planner.

 Data Collection and Storage

 The POLYCENTER Performance Data Collector collects data according to
 a user-defined schedule. The user may specify the classes of infor-
 mation to be collected and the sampling frequency. Any number of col-
 lections can be defined and active on the target system.

 The Data Collector requires sufficient disk space to store performance
 data. In the absence of sufficient space, it automatically suspends
 recording of performance data until space becomes available.

 Dump Report

 The Dump Report displays unanalyzed data from the POLYCENTER Perfor-
 mance Solution database files in user-readable format. The user may
 report any or all of the following data collection categories in this
 report:

 o  Metrics

 o  Parameters

 o  Processes

 o  Disks and disk caches

 o  Tapes

 o  Communications

 o  System configuration and SCS

 o  CPU

 o  Rules

                                  2

 

 o  Hotfiles

 Data Archiving

 The POLYCENTER Performance Data Collector provides data archiving ca-
 pabilities to enable long-term data analysis. Daily Performance So-
 lution data files are archived into history files, which the POLYCEN-
 TER Performance Advisor can use to generate Performance Evaluation Re-
 ports, Analysis Reports, and Graphs.

 The user defines specifically how the data is to be archived and can
 specify the granularity, periodicity, time interval, workload char-
 acterization schema, retention period, schedule, and holiday sched-
 ule. The size of the history file is dependent on the data reduction
 scheme selected.

 System Program Counter Reporting

 System Program Counter (PC) sampling and reporting provides detailed
 CPU analysis for a system, OpenVMS executive module, or process. These
 reports can be used to determine the amount of CPU time spent in:

 o  User, supervisory, executive, and kernel modes

 o  System services

 o  FDT routines

 o  Device drivers

 o  RMS

 o  Interrupt priority level (IPL)

 Histograms provide information on CPU utilization distribution by IPL.

 Event Trace Facility (OpenVMS VAX Version Only)

 The Event Trace Facility (ETF) is a collection of OpenVMS system ser-
 vices that can be used to monitor and record events occurring in the

                                  3

 

 OpenVMS executive. It is especially suited for solving complex per-
 formance data collection tasks for OpenVMS executive routines and de-
 vice drivers. The facility provides the routines needed to initial-
 ize itself, define and activate trace points, pass control to user-
 written data collection routines, and perform buffer and record man-
 agement. Language support for calling ETF system services include BLISS-
 32, VAX C, VAX Pascal, and VAX BASIC, as well as VAX MACRO.

 Disk Space Analysis

 Disk Space Analysis reports on the usage of allocated and available
 space on a disk. This information assists in determining the level of
 file fragmentation and the efficiency of space occupied by the files
 on the disk. This analysis also provides volume information that is
 set during initialization of the disk.

 File Activity Display

 The File Activity Display identifies the files on a disk that are most
 frequently accessed. This real-time display is beneficial in locat-
 ing file related performance problems. The I/O rate, read percentage,
 number of references to the file, and file name are displayed for each
 active file of the selected disk.

 Features

 The POLYCENTER Performance Data Collector has these features:

 o  Support for standalone and clustered VAX and AXP systems

 o  The collected system data can be archived into history data files

 o  DECwindows Motif[R] interface for customizing data collection and
    viewing data collection reports

 o  Conversion of VAX Software Performance Monitor (SPM) history files
    into POLYCENTER Performance Data Collector format

 o  Formatted reporting of the collected data

                                  4

 

 o  The following data collection parameters can be set by the user:

    -  Collection interval

    -  Collection schedule

    -  Number of active collection streams

    -  Classes of data to collect

    -  Location (device and directory) of collection files

 o  System PC sampling and reporting to perform detailed CPU utiliza-
    tion analysis

 o  The Event Trace Facility provides a callable interface for user-
    written data collection for OpenVMS VAX

 o  Dynamic file activity display to monitor busy files

 o  Disk Space Analysis for determining disk fragmentation and effi-
    ciency

 o  Provides the necessary data used by the POLYCENTER Performance Ad-
    visor and Capacity Planner products

 o  Provides data to the POLYCENTER Performance Advisor DECwindows Mo-
    tif and character cell RealTime Displays

 o  Use DECwindows Motif Hyper-Help.
