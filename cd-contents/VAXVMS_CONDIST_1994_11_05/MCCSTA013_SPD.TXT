 PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER Network Statistics Option, Version 1.3 SPD
                         (formerly DECmcc Performance Statistics
 39.74.01                Package)

 INTRODUCTION

 POLYCENTER Network Statistics Option is one of several separately avail-
 able packages of POLYCENTER Network Management Modules. These prod-
 ucts provide management functions and protocol support for different
 network and system management environments. POLYCENTER Network Man-
 agement Module Options can be installed and used separately or in any
 combination with the POLYCENTER Framework. The management services pro-
 vided by newly installed modules are automatically enrolled in the POLY-
 CENTER Framework and are available to management services already in-
 stalled.

 POLYCENTER Framework software is the minimum prerequisite software prod-
 uct for POLYCENTER Network Management Module Options such as the Net-
 work Statistics Option. Please refer to the POLYCENTER Network Man-
 agement Services Software Product Description (SPD 37.20.xx) for a list
 of the POLYCENTER Network Management products and module packages, and
 for a description of their relationship to each other and to the Dig-
 ital Enterprise Management Architecture (EMA).

 DESCRIPTION

 The POLYCENTER Network Statistics Option calculates statistics for se-
 lected entity classes such as DECnet Phase IV and DECnet/OSI nodes,
 TCP/IP hosts, and Digital LAN Bridges. Information such as error counts,
 utilization percentages, and other statistical data can be collected,
 processed, and used to track network and device utilization. Used with
 the POLYCENTER Framework Notification Option, output from this pack-
 age can be used to establish alarm thresholds. As numeric attributes,

 output from the POLYCENTER Network Statistics Option can be displayed
 as graphs or histograms in the Motif(R)/Iconic Map PM Graph Window, or
 exported to an external relational database (using the POLYCENTER Frame-
 work Historian Option) for additional processing and report genera-
 tion. The POLYCENTER Network Statistics Option also includes sample
 error and utilization reports for use with the POLYCENTER Historian
 Option.

 NOTE: Setup and printing of the sample reports requires the use of CDD
 /Repository, DATATRIEVE, and DECgraph on OpenVMS VAX systems, and IN-
 GRES[TM] Tools for ULTRIX/SQL.
