 PRODUCT NAME:   POLYCENTER Security Intrusion          SPD 41.27.01
                 Detector for OpenVMS, Version 1.0

 DESCRIPTION

 POLYCENTER Security Intrusion Detector (ID) for OpenVMS is a security
 tool that constantly monitors suspicious or hostile activity and re-
 ports any activity to the security manager.

 POLYCENTER Security ID operates in realtime, processing security alarms
 from the VMS Audit Server as they occur and notifying the security 
 manager via mail. Furthermore, POLYCENTER Security ID can be configured
 to take countermeasures against intruders without human intervention.

 Security managers can use POLYCENTER Security ID from within the POLY-
 CENTER Security Compliance Manager (CM) for OpenVMS menu system or from
 the DCL command line.

 POLYCENTER Security ID does the following:

 o  Notifies security managers about critical security events occurring 
    on a system, as detected by the VMS Audit Server. The following is a 
    list of these events:

    -  UAF modifications

    -  Proxy modifications

    -  Rights list modifications

    -  Privileged image installations

    -  File access failures

    -  Login successes by hostile users

    -  Break-in events
   
    -  Login failures

 o  Mails summary or detailed reports about the security events. One
    or more security managers specified on the POLYCENTER Security ID
    security manager list receive the reports. Only some reports are
    sent at specified intervals. Most are sent in realtime.
    The following is a list of reports sent in realtime:

    -  Notification of a change in the system time.

    -  Full security reports of UAF, proxy, and rights operations.

    -  Full security reports when audit alarms are modified.

    -  Notification of password modification by users (this is enabled
       by the RID SET REPORT/PASSWORD_SET DCL command).

    -  Monitored local users, remote users or remote nodes become ac-
       tive (these reports are sent when users/remote users/nodes to
       declared to be hostile through the menu interface or through the
       RID MONITOR DCL command).

 The following reports are not sent in realtime:

    -  Daily login failure summary.

    -  Full intrusion notification of break-in, install, and mount alarm
       messages. Repeated triggering of the same alarm by the same user
       causes only one mail message over the period of hours given by
       the MAIL_INTERVAL value.

    -  Excessive account failure activity per day (this is the message
       sent when a user exceeds the total login failure threshold).

o  Initiates countermeasures against hostile users.

       If countermeasures are enabled, POLYCENTER Security ID takes ac-
       tion to counteract the security event. For example, a suspected
       intruder process is deleted or a suspected account is disabled
       after an account exceeds a certain number of events.

       If countermeasures are not enabled, the security manager still
       receives notification of the events; however, no counteraction
       takes place. For example, the suspected account is not disabled.

       Some limited countermeasures are always performed to preserve
       the integrity of POLYCENTER Security ID itself. For example, if
       an unauthorized user disables audit alarms, POLYCENTER Security
       ID re-enables alarms automatically. Also, POLYCENTER Security
       ID protects its own run-time parameter file and recreates it 
       automatically if it is deleted.

 o  Allows security managers to issue commands to POLYCENTER Security
    ID to monitor any suspected user and remote login sources for a 
    specified length of time. For example, this feature is used if a 
    known local account is being used to penetrate a system and it is 
    desired to identify the remote login sources.

 o  Sends security event messages, known as alarm tokens, to a DECnet
    node running POLYCENTER Security Reporting Facility (SRF) for VMS
    software. Upon receipt of the alarm token, POLYCENTER SRF notifies
    the POLYCENTER SRF administrator (via electronic mail) about the
    security event.

 Alarm tokens contain information about the node's security manager,
 target entity, source entity, failure type, and failure limit. Stor-
 ing the alarm tokens, gives the administrator access to current and
 historical information about security events occurring on one or more
 nodes across a network.
