    The POLYCENTER Capacity Planner modeling component is used to predict
    the performance of standalone OpenVMS VAX, OpenVMS AXP, and VMSclus-
    ter systems, and to determine system performance levels for various
    workloads and configurations. Performance calculations are based on
    queuing theory and analytic models.

    The modeling component includes a graphical modeling interface from
    which "what-if" analyses can be performed. A baseline model is cre-
    ated from information collected by the POLYCENTER Performance Data Col-
    lectors. This baseline model becomes the starting point for assess-
    ing the impact of changes to the configuration or the workloads. Users
    can add, delete, or change any hardware component or workload, and ex-
    amine the impact on performance by viewing various performance met-
    rics, such as: utilization, response times, throughput, queue length,
    and service time. Models can be saved for further evaluation. The "what-
    if" analyses form the foundation of capacity plans.

    The POLYCENTER Capacity Planner allows the system manager or planner
    to define the system's total workload in terms of manageable units.
    Workloads are expressed as classes that include groups of processes
    (for both OpenVMS and U*IX with similar characteristics). These classes
    are used in model generation. Workload classes can be defined accord-
    ing to users, UICs, process name, account name, and process mode. Sub-
    classes are a set of transactions under a class. These may be images
    if the images function as transactions. Workloads are thus able to be
    expressed as a class/subclass table for transaction performance statis-
    tics. U*IX subclasses are not supported since a process runs one and
    only one image (command).

    The POLYCENTER Capacity Planner provides performance information for
    each supported CPU, HSC, disk, channel, adapter, bridge, router, and
    interconnect at both current and projected workloads or configurations.
    This includes support for OpenVMS volume shadowing and disk striping
    (but not above RAID-1 level).

    The POLYCENTER Capacity Planner supports the following network pro-
    tocols:

    o  SCS

    o  NSP/DECnet

    o  OSI/DECnet

    o  TCP/IP

    o  UDP/IP

    o  LAT

    The network subsystem, as it pertains to system-based capacity plan-
    ning, is the set of network components and protocols for which com-
    munication of workload traverses selected network path(s) over all ca-
    pacity planning end-node pairs. The modeling focus of the network sub-
    system is to support end-to-end response time modeling, network de-
    vice performance, and client/server capacity planning (extended LAN
             ___             not    support,     WAN).

    Client/server support is provided in that software servers may be de-
    fined to serve one or more clients. Multiple levels of software servers
    are allowed. POLYCENTER Capacity Planner will support capacity plan-
    ning for environments that include applications whose client/server
    components are implemented on multiple CPUs.

    The performance statistics are provided in either summary or detailed
    reports and include:

    o  Resource utilization

    o  Response time

    o  Throughput

    o  Queue length

    o  Service time

    POLYCENTER Capacity Planner provides prediction reporting that indi-
    cates the workload size at which a component will saturate. The re-
    port shows the system performance at incremental increases of work-
    load up to the saturation point. The increment steps are 25 percent
    of initial component utilization. After an increase to 100 percent,
    only the saturation point is shown.

    The saturation analysis identifies bottlenecks before they occur, al-
    lowing the system manager to be proactive in eliminating bottlenecks
    and providing a consistent level of system performance to users.

    Features    Features    Features

    POLYCENTER Capacity Planner provides the user with the capabilities
    to plan effectively for future computer resource needs:

    o  A graphical modeling interface provides an easy-to-use tool for per-
       forming multiple "what-if" analyses.

    o  Work performed by OpenVMS systems can be grouped into meaningful
       categories.

    POLYCENTER Capacity Planner has two portions: the Modeler/Characterizer
    and the Data Integrator. The Data Integrator compresses performance
    data collected from one or more nodes by Data Collectors. The Modeler/Characterizer
    provides the following functions:

    o  Performance modeling is supported for standalone systems with the
       above operating systems and VMScluster systems.

    o  "What-if" analysis provides performance characteristics of the sys-
       tem before actual changes are implemented.

    o  Built-in configuration rules assist in modeling and validating sup-
       ported configurations.

    o  Saturation analysis identifies the workload at which system com-
       ponents will saturate and performance bottlenecks will occur.

    o  Session journaling and recovery is supported.

    o  CPU priority modeling is supported.
