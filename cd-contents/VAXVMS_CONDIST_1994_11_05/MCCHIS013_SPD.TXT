 PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER Framework Historian Option, V1.3      SPD
                         (formerly DECmcc Historical Data Pack-
 39.73.01                age)

 INTRODUCTION

 POLYCENTER Framework Historian Option is one of several separately avail-
 able options to add functionality to the basic POLYCENTER Framework.
 They add specific management functions and are also included in the
 comprehensive POLYCENTER Network Manager products. These add-on op-
 tions offer management functions and protocol support for different
 network and system management environments. POLYCENTER Network Man-
 agement Module Packages can be installed and used separately or in any
 combination with the POLYCENTER Framework. The management services pro-
 vided by newly installed modules are automatically enrolled in the POLY-
 CENTER Framework and are available to management services already in-
 stalled.

 POLYCENTER Framework software is the minimum prerequisite software prod-
 uct for POLYCENTER Management Modules such as the POLYCENTER Framework
 Historian Option Package. Refer to the POLYCENTER Network Management
 Services Software Product Description (SPD 37.20.xx) for a list of the
 POLYCENTER products and module packages, and for a description of their
 relationship to each other and to the Digital Enterprise Management
 Architecture (EMA).

 DESCRIPTION

 The POLYCENTER Framework Historian Option enables users to collect,
 time stamp, and store management data. This data is then available to
 users or to other POLYCENTER management services, such as the POLY-
 CENTER Notification Option and the POLYCENTER Network Statistics Op-
 tion. The POLYCENTER Framework Historian Option also includes a data

 export function that enables users to write historical data, or other
 attribute data, to an external relational database for additional pro-
 cessing and report generation. The data export functions of the POLYCENTER
 Framework Historian Option require the use of ULTRIX/SQL on RISC/ULTRIX
 systems or Rdb Runtime on OpenVMS systems. The ULTRIX/SQL database will
 be included with the ULTRIX version of this product.

 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

 figurations with an Ethernet controller as specified in the System Sup-
 port Addendum (SSA 39.73.01-x).

 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

 For OpenVMS:

    -  OpenVMS VAX Operating System

 o  For Workstations Running Motif:

    -  OpenVMS VAX Operating System
       (and necessary components of Motif)

    -  POLYCENTER Framework and prerequisites

 For RISC/ULTRIX:

 o  For Systems Using Terminals (no Motif interface):

    -  ULTRIX Operating System

 o  For Workstations (both with and without Motif):

    -  POLYCENTER Framework and prerequisites

                                  2

 

    -  ULTRIX/SQL database must be installed on the system to which data
       is exported using the Export FM

       NOTE: ULTRIX/SQL V2.0 has entered product phasedown. Support for
       ULTRIX/SQL will be discontinued after December 31, 1993. Because
       ULTRIX/SQL is no longer bundled with the ULTRIX operating sys-
       tem, this database is now included separately in the POLYCEN-
       TER Framework Historian Option kit. You must install this database
       on an ULTRIX system to use the POLYCENTER Historian and Exporter
       functions. After December 31, 1993, these functions will require
       a separate license for INGRES[TM]/SQL.

 Refer to the System Support Addendum (SSA 39.73.01-x) for availabil-
 ity and required versions of prerequisite/optional software.
