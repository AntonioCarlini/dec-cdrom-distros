 PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER System Watchdog Consolidator SPD 41.42.02
                for OpenVMS[*], Version 1.0

 DESCRIPTION

 The POLYCENTER System Watchdog Consolidator for OpenVMS is an Open-
 VMS layered product that helps Information Systems personnel manage
 computer-related problems that occur in OpenVMS systems interconnected
 by a wide area network. Operating in conjunction with the POLYCENTER
 System Watchdog Agent for OpenVMS, it gives operators and system man-
 agers the ability to monitor potential problem conditions from many
 dispersed systems at a single terminal. This enables the operations
 staff to become aware of such potential problems quickly and correct
 them as early as possible.

 The POLYCENTER System Watchdog Consolidator for OpenVMS has a database
 (called a "Profile") of systems to be monitored, and polls the POLY-
 CENTER System Watchdog Agents on these systems at specified intervals.

 There are three broad categories of events that may be monitored by
 the POLYCENTER System Watchdog Consolidator. These categories are:

 o  "network" category

    -  node unreachable

    -  node out of resources

    -  node unknown

    -  no server/agent

    -  connection problems

 ____________________

 The   terms VMS and OpenVMS refer to the OpenVMS operating system.

 Software Components

 POLYCENTER System Watchdog Consolidator consists of the following com-
 ponents:

 o  SNS$CONSOLIDATOR is a detached process that periodically polls the
    SNS$WATCHDOG Agents and requests the currently active event mes-
    sages. SNS$CONSOLIDATOR maintains a composite list of event mes-
    sages from all of the SNS$WATCHDOG Agents that are polled. SNS$CONSOLIDATOR
    invokes action routines, and VMS mailbox output for new, updated,
    and removed event messages (when these actions are enabled in the
    Consolidator's Profile). It similarly invokes DECtalk actions for
    new and updated event messages (when DECtalk is enabled in the Pro-
    file). It logs event status changes and notification operations to
    a file. SNS$CONSOLIDATOR also responds to maintenance and display
    requests from one or more SNS$CONTROL programs.

 o  SNS$CONTROL is an interactive process started with the SENSE WATCH-
    DOGS command at the DCL prompt. SNS$CONTROL provides the operator
    interface to display event messages, maintain (edit) the POLYCEN-
    TER System Watchdog Consolidator Profile, add and delete external
    messages, and start, reconfigure, select, and stop SNS$CONSOLIDATOR
    processes. The operator interface display does not require a work-
    station, but can instead be used from any standard terminal. Sep-
    arate scrollable lists of high priority and low priority event mes-
    sages are shown, each with a time stamp and a one-line description
    of the source and nature of the detected problem. The editing of
    the Profiles may be accomplished from either a DCL command line in-
    terface or a DECwindows Motif(R) editor if a workstation with DECwin-
    dows is available.

 o  SNS$SHR is a shareable image containing the routines SNS$ADD_MESSAGE
    and SNS$DELETE_MESSAGE. SNS$ADD_MESSAGE adds an external message
    to the list of event messages maintained by the SNS$WATCHDOG Agent
    on a specified node. SNS$DELETE_MESSAGE removes an external mes-
    sage from the specified SNS$WATCHDOG Agent's list.

 o  SNS$PROFILE.DAT is a data file that defines which System Watchdog
    Agents to poll, which conditions to ask each Agent to monitor (in-
    cluding threshold values where appropriate), and the types of no-
    tification and actions to be performed on the occurrence of an event
    (an event is the detection of one of the specified conditions). SNS$PROFILE.DAT
    is a default profile provided with the kit. The user must customize
    the profile using SNS$CONTROL's EDIT PROFILE command. Each invo-
    cation of SNS$CONSOLIDATOR with the START or RECONFIGURE command
    may specify a different named profile to be used.
