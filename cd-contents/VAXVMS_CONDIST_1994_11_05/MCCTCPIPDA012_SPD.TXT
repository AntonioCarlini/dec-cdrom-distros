 PRODUCT NAME:  DECmcc Fault Diagnostic Package, Version 1.2     SPD
 39.72.00

 INTRODUCTION

 DECmcc Fault Diagnostic Package is one of several packages of DECmcc
 Management Modules that can be used in conjunction with a prepackaged
 DECmcc Product Family Management System. The DECmcc Module Packages
 provide management functions and protocol support for generic and spe-
 cific network and system-managed object environments.

 DECmcc Module Packages can be installed on a DECmcc Director and used
 individually or in combination with one another. The management ser-
 vices provided by a newly installed module or module package are en-
 rolled as part of the DECmcc Director Software and are available to
 management services already installed.

 DECmcc Director software is the minimum prerequisite software prod-
 uct for DECmcc Management Module Packages such as the Fault Diagnos-
 tic Package. The Fault Diagnostic Package can also be installed on a
 DECmcc Basic Management System (BMS) and is available in OpenVMS VAX
 and RISC/ULTRIX versions.

 Refer to the DECmcc Management Services Software Product Description
 (SPD 37.20.xx) for a list of the DECmcc products and module packages
 and a description of their relationship to each other and the Digital
 Enterprise Management Architecture (EMA).

 DESCRIPTION

 The DECmcc Fault Diagnostic Package is a troubleshooting tool designed
 to simplify the process of isolating and quickly resolving some of the
 most frequently occurring TCP/IP network problems, minimizing down-
 time and maximizing network efficiency. It uses common UNIX(R) Utili-
 ties and Bourne Shell scripts to retrieve information about a TCP/IP
 network.

 The DECmcc Fault Diagnostic Package is comprised of ten diagnostic rou-
 tines, a load check utility, a path trace utility, and a ping util-
 ity. The diagnostic routines are:

 o  Diagnose host_unknown

 o  Diagnose host_unreachable

 o  Diagnose inetdaemon

 o  Diagnose network_unreachable

 o  Diagnose nfs_problem

 o  Diagnose rcp_denied

 o  Diagnose rlogin_denied

 o  Diagnose rsh_denied

 o  Diagnose telnet_refused

 o  Diagnose telnet_timeout

 These routines are designed to help users isolate network faults such
 as component failures, improperly set parameters, and improper file
 protections. When a diagnostic routine is executed, the Fault Diag-
 nostic software determines the tests to execute. After the tests are
 executed, it produces a report containing test results and the rec-
 ommended actions an operator should take to troubleshoot or repair the
 problem.

 The DECmcc Fault Diagnostic Package can diagnose problems between the
 station on which DECmcc resides and a remote host, or between two hosts
 that are remote from the DECmcc station (i.e., the DECmcc station re-
 sides on a third host which is not involved in the reported problem).
