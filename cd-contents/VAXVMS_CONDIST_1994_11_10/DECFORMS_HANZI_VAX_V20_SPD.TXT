PRODUCT NAME: DECforms/Hanzi for OpenVMS VAX, V2.0      SPD 26.D3.02




DESCRIPTION

DECforms/Hanzi for OpenVMS VAX V2.0 is the simplified Chinese (hereafter
referred to as local language) version of standard DECforms V2.0 which
offers a set of software development tools and a run-time environment for
implementing powerful yet user-friendly human interfaces. DECforms/Hanzi
extends standard DECforms to support local language characters under the
OpenVMS/Hanzi VAX operating system.

DECforms is DIGITAL's OpenVMS implementation of the proposed ANSI/ISO
standard for Form Interface Management System (FIMS). One of the most
powerful principles reflected in the DECforms architecture is complete
separation of forms and functions. With DECforms, user interface
processing is completely removed from the application program and totally
isolated within the form itself. The application program is only concerned 
with the processing of data, not with the gathering and display of data at 
the user interface. This makes application programs much simpler to develop 
and easier to maintain.

DECforms/Hanzi supports simplified Chinese data representation that
conforms to the Primary Set of National Standard Code of Chinese
Characters Set for Information Interchange (GB-2312) of the People's Re
public of China.

This SPD describes the local language specific features of the software
product. For details of the DECforms V2.0 features, please refer to
DECforms V2.0 Software Product Description (SPD 29.90.xx).
