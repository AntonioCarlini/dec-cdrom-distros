           The DECwindows Motif OpenVMS User Interface/Svenska V1.2-3 consists
           of the following basic components:

           Session Manager

           Session Manager provides the top-level user interface to a DECwindows
           workstation in the locale language. From Session Manager, users can
           start applications, customize their session and perform security man-
           agement. On a multiple language variants system, Session Manager also
           lets users specify the language user interface for supported 
           DECwindows applications if they have ordered, installed and are 
           licensed to use the appropriate DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS 
           language variant kit(s).

           The user interface language of the Session Manager itself cannot be
           changed without closing the DECwindows session and opening it again.

           Window Manager

           Window Manager allows the user to control the size and placement of
           windows. The OSF/Motif Window Manager is provided as the default win-
           dow manager; users can choose instead to work with the DECwindows XUI
           Window Manager. The window Manager can be chosen by an individual 
           user or by a system manager for an entire system.

           To change the Window Manager user interface language on the multiple
           language variants system, the user should select a language from the
           Session Manager, then restart the Window Manager. Window Manager user
           interface language will not follow the subsequent language changes 
           inside the same session and will remain in the language chosen 
           until the next restart.
           FileView

           FileView, a graphical interface to the OpenVMS file system, allows 
           users to navigate the file system and to perform operations on files.

           The user interface language of the FileView itself cannot be changed
           without closing the DECwindows session and opening it again.

           DECterm Terminal Emulator

           The locale version of DECterm terminal emulator provides the user 
           with a translated DECterm user interface, as well as with the 
           capability to display, or to cut and paste a text containing local 
           language specific characters.

           Processors Not Supported

           For performance reasons, DECwindows Motif OpenVMS VAX Version 1.2-3
           is not supported on the following processors:

           MicroVAX II, MicroVAX 2000, VAXstation II,
           VAXstation 2000, VAX-11/725, VAX-11/750, VAX-11/782,

           Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1)

           The disk space figures specified below refer to the disk space 
           required for Swedish language variant installation, assuming that 
           all prerequisite software is already installed. The figures are 
           approximate and common to installation on VAX or Alpha. The size of
           the other language variant kits may vary depending on the language 
           and on the code set supported by the language concerned (some 
           language variant kits must include language specific fonts that are
           not installed with the standard DECwindows Motif product).

           Memory Requirements for OpenVMS Alpha and VAX Systems

           Memory Requirements for OpenVMS Alpha Systems

           The minimum amount of memory required for a system user to install,
           boot, and log in to an OpenVMS Alpha system running DECwindows Motif
           OpenVMS Alpha User Interface/Svenska V1.2-3 is 32 MB. Remote execu-
           tion of applications requires an additional system that runs the ap-
           plication while the application is displayed on the local 
           workstation.

           The performance and memory usage of OpenVMS Alpha systems running 
           DECwindows Motif OpenVMS Alpha User Interface/Svenska V1.2-3 depend
           on the system configuration and window and applications usage.

           Memory Requirements for OpenVMS VAX Systems

           The minimum amount of memory required for a system user to install,
           boot, and log in to an OpenVMS VAX system running DECwindows Motif 
           OpenVMS (VAX) User Interface/Svenska is 12MB. 16MB is highly 
           recommended for a more robust performance. Remote execution of 
           applications requires an additional system that runs the application 
           while the application is displayed on the local workstation.

           The performance and memory usage of OpenVMS VAX systems running 
           DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS VAX User Interface/Svenska V1.2-3 
           depend on system configuration and window and applications usage.

           Supported Multiscreen Configurations

           DECwindows Motif supports workstations with multiple screens. On the
           Alpha operating system, a multiscreen configuration consists of a 
           single DEC 2000 or DEC 3000 series workstation that supports multiple
           graphics options. A graphics option consists of a graphics controller
           and a monitor.

           The DEC 3000 Model 400 workstation supports up to three monitors. The
           DEC 3000 Model 500 workstation supports up to six monitors (integral
           graphics plus five HX options). The HX is a TURBOchannel-based, 2D 
           accelerated graphics option that supports 66 or 72 Hz monitors with
           1280 x 1024 screen addressing.
