PRODUCT NAME:  AAF01/VMS Subroutine Library, Version 2.0          SPD 27.49.01
               (for VMS Operating Systems)


DESCRIPTION

The AAF01/VMS Subroutine Library provides user with a simple FORTRAN
interface to the AAF01-A Digital-to-Analog Converter. 

The AAF01-A is a high speed, multichannel Digital-to-Analog Converter. It is
connected to a UBA (UNIBUS adapter) via the DRE11-C or to Q-bus (MicroVAX II)
via the DRQ11-C. 

The device has 16 single ended analogue output channels. Triggering of
conversions by the AAF01-A can be initiated by either an internal
programmable clock or by a user-supplied external clock. For each conversion,
the channel number and the control mode are contained in one of 1024 entries
in the AAF01-A Control Table.  The Control Table can thus be set up to
perform a large, fixed sequence of conversion operations. 

The Subroutine Library contains calls such as:

^  To set up/release the AAF01 device:

   AAF$FAINIT    initialize system

   AAF$FREAST    read status of the device

   AAF$FRESET    reset device

   AAF$FSETCH    set channel (multiple AAF01s)

   AAF$FAEXIT    release device

   AAF$FAAFID    identify Subroutine Library

   AAF$STATUS    read status of DRE11-C/DRQ11-C device

^  To enable/disable AAF01 functions:
  
   AAF$FSTSBE    enable sequence break

   AAF$FCLSBE    disable sequence break

   AAF$FENECE    enable external clock

   AAF$FDSECE    disable external clock

   AAF$FENMET    enable control word transfer

   AAF$FDSMET    disable control word transfer

^  To load or read AAF01 registers:

   AAF$FRECTA    read from Control Table Address register

   AAF$FLOCTA    write into Control Table Address register

   AAF$FSTPCR    load Programmable Clock Register

   AAF$FLOCWT    load Control Word Table registers

   AAF$FRECWT    read Control Word Table registers

   AAF$FREACO    read command output bit of the Control and Status register

   AAF$FSETCO    set command output bit of the Control and Status register

^  To start conversions and convert values:
 
   AAF$FCVERT    start conversion

   AAF$CONLAR    start large buffer conversion

   AAF$FCVCOD    calculate converter code

   AAF$FUNSOL    enable/disable attention AST's

In addition to the subroutines above, the package includes a set of indirect
command procedures to generate the AAF01/VMS Subroutine Library, to generate
a Control Word  Table and to link a user program, the Control Word Table and
the Subroutine Library. The package also includes example programs and test
programs, the latter being used for calibrating the system. 

PERFORMANCE

The highest conversion rate depends highly on the VMS Operating System
configuration/load and on the way, how the outgoing data are prepared/read
from a mass storage. The maximum transfer rate of 400K words/sec from memory
can be achieved in burst mode on all valid VAX/MicroVAX systems with the
standard DRX11-C/VMS Driver (SPD 26.64.xx). 

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

VAX, MicroVAX or VAXstation configuration as specified in the System Support 
Addendum (SSA 27.49.01-x)

^  One DRE11-C or DRQ11-C interface
^  One AAF01-A Interface
^  Hardware capable of reading one of the distribution media upon which this 
   product is offered.
