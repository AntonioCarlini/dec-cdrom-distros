  SPD 46.55.02
  
  This Software Product Description describes the following two 
  products:
  
  o  DECwindows Motif/Hebrew for OpenVMS VAX Version 1.2-3

  o  DECwindows Motif/Hebrew for OpenVMS Alpha Version 1.2-3

  DESCRIPTION
  
  DECwindows Motif/Hebrew for OpenVMS is the Hebrew language variant sup-
  port for the base DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS. The product provides
  Hebrew characters input/output support.
  
  The DECwindows desktop environment provides a graphical user inter-
  face to the OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha operating systems. 
  DECwindows incorporates the Open Software Foundation's Motif user 
  interface as the design center for DECwindows applications. OSF/Motif[R] 
  is a graphical user interface widely acknowledged as the industry 
  standard. This interface allows users to interact with the OpenVMS VAX 
  and OpenVMS Alpha operating systems using a point-and-click technique. 
  DECwindows includes a set of integrated desktop applications that 
  demonstrate the ease-of-use of this user interface and provides OpenVMS 
  Alpha users with a base set of desktop tools.
  
  DECwindows Motif/Hebrew Version 1.2-3 for OpenVMS supports both the
  DECwindows X User Interface (XUI) and the Motif Window Manager.
  
  It supports a coexistence of different language variants on the same
  computing system, with the possibility of changing easily from one lan-
  guage to another.
  
  Language Variants Coexistence
  
  On the same system with DECwindows Motif V1.2-3 for OpenVMS Hebrew lan-
  guage variant it is possible to install the following DECwindows 
  Motif V1.2-3 for OpenVMS language variants:

  For more information about software prerequisites required to install
  these language variants, refer to the appropriate SPD, Release Notes
  and Installation Guide.
  
  The DECwindows Motif/Hebrew for OpenVMS user environment consists of
  the following basic components:
  
  1. Session Manager
  
  Session Manager provides the top-level user interface to a DECwindows
  workstation. From Session Manager, users can start applications, cus-
  tomize their session, and perform security management. Session 
  Manager also lets users specify the language user interface for supported
  DECwindows applications if they have ordered, installed, and are li-
  censed to use the appropriate DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS language
  variant kit(s). For the supported language variants, refer to the 
  DECwindows Motif OpenVMS User Interface Product SPD.
  
  Session Manager is not available in Hebrew user interface, but it en-
  ables activation of Hebrew supported applications.
  
  2. Window Manager
  
  The Window Manager lets users control the size and placement of win-
  dows. The OSF/Motif Window Manager is provided as the default window
  manager; users can choose instead to work with the DECwindows X User
  Interface (XUI) Window Manager. The window manager can be chosen by
  an individual user or by a system manager for an entire system.

  DECwindows Motif[R]/Hebrew Version 1.2-3 for OpenVMS    SPD 46.55.02
  
  
  3. FileView
  
  FileView, a graphical interface to the OpenVMS file system, allows users
  to navigate the file system and to perform operations on files.
  
  4. DECterm Terminal Emulator

  The DECterm terminal emulator provides workstation users with a tra-
  ditional character-cell interface for existing OpenVMS features and
  applications. It is a VT320 terminal emulator, which simulates also
  the Hebrew functionality of VT100-, VT220- and VT320-class terminals.
  It supports ReGIS and sixel, but is not fully VT340 compatible. Pro-
  grams written for VT52-, VT100-, VT220-, or VT320-class terminals and
  using OpenVMS terminal driver features operate without modification
  in this workstation window. DECterm also provides workstation-oriented
  features, such as mouse-based cursor positioning, variable screen sizes,
  and cutting and pasting of text between DECterm and other DECwindows
  applications. Many programs can also use these features without mod-
  ification.
  
  Desktop Productivity Applications
  
  DECwindows Motif/Hebrew for OpenVMS provides a set of integrated desk-
  top applications that employ a common look and feel to help users eas-
  ily master their computing environment.
  
  All desktop applications listed in the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS
  V1.2 Software Product Description (SPD 42.19.01), except LinkWorks 
  Manager, are also available in DECwindows Motif/Hebrew for OpenVMS 
  Version 1.2-3. However, these applications are not available in Hebrew
  user interface. Hebrew text input is supported only in Cardfiler, Paint
  and Calendar applications.
  
  The DECwindows Motif/Hebrew for OpenVMS Help System
  
  The DECwindows Motif Help System uses the familiar Bookreader inter-
  face to display Help and to retrieve Help information. This Help sys-
  tem includes a Table of Contents and cross-referencing through the use
  of hotspots.
  
  Apart from some basic topics which were translated into Hebrew, all
  the help text is in English. The Hebrew help text is available only
  via the help widget, and cannot be used with Bookreader.
  
  HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
  
  DECwindows Motif/Hebrew runs on any of the supported processors, but
  requires either a workstation, a DOS-based PC, a Macintosh[R] or an X
  terminal for display. These display devices must be running an 
  X Window System, Version 11, Release 4 (R4) or Release 5 (R5) compliant 
  display server.
