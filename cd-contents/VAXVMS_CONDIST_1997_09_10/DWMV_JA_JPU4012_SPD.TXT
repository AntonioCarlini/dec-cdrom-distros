PRODUCT NAME: DECwindows Motif[R]
Japanese Version 1.2-4 for OpenVMS                               SPD 28.A8.03

This Software Product Description describes the following two products:

o  DECwindows Motif[R]/Japanese Version 1.2-4 for OpenVMS VAX

o  DECwindows Motif[R]/Japanese Version 1.2-4 for OpenVMS Alpha

The Description section describes features common to both products. Any
differences in product features are explicitly indicated.

1  DESCRIPTION

The DECwindows desktop environment provides a graphical user interface to
the OpenVMS/Japanese VAX and OpenVMS/Japanese Alpha operating systems.
This interface allows users to interact with OpenVMS/Japanese VAX and
OpenVMS/Japanese Alpha using a point-and-click technique. DECwindows includes
a set of integrated desktop applications that demonstrate the ease of use
of this user interface and provides OpenVMS users with a base set of desktop
tools.

DECwindows Motif/Japanese Version 1.2-4 for OpenVMS Alpha delivers the
New Desktop environment for OpenVMS Alpha systems, which is derived from
the CDE (Common Desktop Environment) technology. CDE provides and defines
a consistent user interface for end users and a consistent development
environment for application developers across multiple platforms.

The graphical user interface that was provided in previous versions of
DECwindows Motif is still available and is referred to as the DECwindows
desktop. The DECwindows desktop is the only desktop provided for OpenVMS
VAX. On OpenVMS Alpha, the installation procedure gives users the choice
of installing one or both desktops and asks which desktop should be started
by default. If both desktops are installed, the user can switch desktops by
restarting DECwindows.

 DECwindows Motif[R]   Japanese Version 1.2-4 for OpenVMS        SPD 28.A8.03



Both the New Desktop and the DECwindows desktop are based on OSF/Motif[R].
Motif is a graphical user interface that is widely acknowledged as the
industry standard.

The DECwindows desktop provides two window managers: the Motif Window Manager
and the XUI Window Manager. Users can switch easily between the two window
managers. The DECwindows desktop productivity applications use the Motif
toolkit, but they also work with the XUI Window Manager.

The DECwindows Motif/Japanese Version 1.2-4 layered product provides both
run-time and programming support for the CDE Motif 1.0 toolkit (OSF/Motif
Release 1.2.5) and the X Consortium's specification for the X Window
System[TM], Version 11, Release 5 (X11 R5), and provides run-time support
for the OSF/Motif Release 1.1.3 and XUI toolkits and X11 R4.

Programs developed for the OSF/Motif Release 1.2.2 and 1.2.3 toolkits that
were provided in previous versions of DECwindows Motif can be run under
the CDE Motif 1.0 toolkit. This means that users can run XUI and Motif
applications, including native applications and, on OpenVMS Alpha systems,
translated applications. (See the Translated Image Environment section of
this SPD for more information about running translated applications).

X Window System standards supported as part of DECwindows Motif include
the X11 network protocol, a base set of workstation fonts, the C language
binding for the Xlib programming library, and the C language binding for the
X Toolkit library.

Support of the X11 network protocol in the client library and display server
components provides the OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha operating systems with
the ability to interoperate with other X11-compliant systems in a distributed
fashion.

DECwindows supports the client/server distribution inherent in the X Window
System. This client/server model allows X Window System clients to run on
one node and display output to another node, using a transport to communicate
between the nodes. The DECwindows Motif/Japanese Version 1.2-4 for OpenVMS
product provides four transport interfaces: local shared memory, DECnet,
TCP/IP (using Digital's TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS product or third-party
products such as MultiNet[R] and Wollongong), and LAT. Users can also provide
their own transport subsystems and transport interfaces.

product or X application runs on or can communicate with DECwindows Motif
for OpenVMS VAX or OpenVMS Alpha systems, consult the application's Software
Product Description.


2  THE NEW DESKTOP

Packaged with DECwindows Motif/Japanese Version 1.2-4 for OpenVMS Alpha
is the New Desktop environment, which is derived from CDE (Common Desktop
Environment) technology. CDE provides a complete desktop environment based on
the CDE Motif 1.0 toolkit (OSF/Motif Release 1.2.5) and X11 R5.

The New Desktop focuses on the user interface and end-user aspects of
CDE technology. The New Desktop requires OpenVMS Alpha Version 6.2 or
higher, which means that the Japanese version of New Desktop requires
OpenVMS/Japanese Alpha Version 6.2 or higher.

The installation procedure asks users to select the preferred desktop.
This choice determines whether the DECwindows Motif login box or the New
Desktop login box appears at startup. After installation, the user can switch
desktops anytime.

Existing OSF/Motif R1.2.3 applications do not need to be recompiled or
relinked to run in the CDE environment. In addition, it is possible to
achieve basic integration of existing applications into the CDE environment
without making changes to the application source code.

The following CDE components are included in this release of the New Desktop:

o  Applications

   -  dtlogin: Login Manager, dtgreet

   -  dthello: Screen between Login Manager and Window Manager

   -  dtscreen: Screen saver displays

2.1  Basic Components

The DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS user environment consists of four basic
components:

o  Session Manager

   Session Manager provides the top-level user interface to a DECwindows
   workstation. From Session Manager, users can start applications, customize
   their session, and perform security management. Session Manager also lets
   users specify the language of the user interface for supported DECwindows
   applications if they have ordered, installed, and are licensed to use the
   appropriate DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS language variant kits.

   For more information about which DECwindows Motif desktop applications
   have translated user interfaces, refer to the SPD for that language
   variant. The DECwindows Motif language variant SPDs also contain
   information on specific local hardware and software support provided in
   the language variant kits.

o  Window Manager

   The Window Manager lets users control the size and placement of windows.
   The OSF/Motif Window Manager is provided as the default window manager;
   users can choose instead to work with the DECwindows XUI Window Manager.
   The window manager can be chosen by an individual user or by a system
   manager for an entire system.

o  FileView

   FileView, a graphical interface to the OpenVMS file system, allows users
   to navigate the file system and to perform operations on files.

o  DECterm

   The DECterm terminal emulator provides workstation users with a
   traditional character-cell interface for existing OpenVMS features and
   applications. It is a VT320 terminal emulator. It supports ReGIS and
   sixel but is not fully VT340 compatible. Programs written for VT52-
   , VT100-, VT220-, or VT320-class terminals and using OpenVMS terminal
   driver features operate without modification in this workstation window.
   DECterm also provides workstation-oriented features, such as mouse-based
   cursor positioning, variable screen sizes, and cutting and pasting of text
   between DECterm and other DECwindows applications. Many programs can also
   use these features without modification.

2.3  Spyglass Enhanced Mosaic Version 2.1 Browser

DECwindows Motif Version 1.2-4 for OpenVMS includes Spyglass Enhanced Mosaic
Version 2.1, a state-of-the-art World Wide Web browser that replaces the NCSA
Mosaic browser.

Mosaic is a World Wide Web browser that lets users navigate and access
information on the Internet. With Mosaic, you can search, retrieve, display,
store, and forward data using the Internet. Mosaic functions in conjunction
with the World Wide Web environment, which is a collection of information
servers.

Mosaic is installed as part of the DECwindows Motif Version 1.2-4 for OpenVMS
systems product installation. Spyglass Enhanced Mosaic Version 2.1 is a fully
supported component and installs in SYS$SYSTEM. Spyglass Enhanced Mosaic
Version 2.1 runs only on OpenVMS Version 6.1 and higher.

Together with the Spyglass Enhanced Mosaic Version 2.1 browser, an NCSA
sample implementation of Mosaic is provided on the VAX VMSINSTAL kit. It
only installs on systems prior to Version 6.1. The NCSA Mosaic browser is
provided as sample, "as is" software to introduce the Internet and help users
get started using a World Wide Web viewer. Because the NCSA Mosaic browser is
only a sample implementation, it is placed with the other sample software in
the DECW$UTILS directory.

To access the Internet with Mosaic, you must install Digital TCP/IP Services
for OpenVMS. If Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS is not installed, you
can display the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS Home Page, but you cannot access
topics on other Internet servers.

Note that Mosaic products supplied by DECwindows Motif V1.2-4 for OpenVMS VAX
and Alpha do not support Japanese.

Library from the MIT X11 Release 4 and 5 distribution are included in the
DECW$UTILS directory of the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS layered product. The
sources and images for a subset of these MIT utilities are included. The XPR
(X Print) utility, which allows users to capture and print the contents of
windows, is provided with DECwindows Motif Version 1.2-4 for OpenVMS Alpha
and OpenVMS VAX. A complete list of available MIT programs is included in the
DECwindows Motif Version 1.2-4 for OpenVMS Release Notes.

2.6  DECwindows Motif/Japanese for OpenVMS Help System

The DECwindows Motif/Japanese help system uses the familiar Bookreader
interface to display help and retrieve help information. This help system
includes a table of contents and cross-referencing through the use of
hotspots.

The DECwindows desktop applications use the DECwindows Motif help system.
When invoking help, either from a help menu or from context-sensitive help,
Bookreader is started and a help topic is displayed.

1.1.3, Release 1.2.2, Release 1.2.3, and XUI programming support are not.

Three categories of libraries are provided:

o  Standard X Window System libraries, such as Xlib and the Intrinsics (X
   Toolkit)

o  CDE Motif 1.0 Toolkit support for developing applications using the Motif
   user interface style

o  Digital added-value libraries that give users additional capabilities:

   -  Digital Extensions to OSF/Motif (DXm)

   -  CDA support

   -  Porting tools for changing applications from the XUI interface to the
      OSF/Motif user interface

Components from each of these areas can be used in any combination to address
the needs of applications. These components can also use the tools from a
variety of programming languages.

DECwindows Motif[R]   Japanese Version 1.2-4 for OpenVMS        SPD 28.A8.03



Motif language bindings are provided for the following programming languages:

o  Digital Fortran for OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha

o  DEC Pascal for OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha

o  DEC C for OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha

In addition, C header files supplied by the OSF have been modified to work
with DEC C++. Pascal and Fortran bindings are included in the DECwindows
Motif kit; OSF/Motif "strongly typed" language bindings for Ada are available
in the DEC Ada for OpenVMS (VAX and Alpha) layered product.

For additional programming support, the
DECW$EXAMPLES_JA_JP directory includes some programming examples.

Programming Support Libraries

The following sections describe the programming support libraries.

X Window System (X) Programming Support

The X Window System compatible X programming library (Xlib) provided by
DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS supplies basic resource management (windows,
color maps, input devices) and bitmap graphics services. It defines a mapping
of the X network protocol to a procedure library.

X Window System Intrinsics Support

The X Window System Intrinsics library support contains the X Consortium
Release 5 (R5) Intrinsics (X Toolkit). The X Toolkit provides low-level
routines that allow the creation of user interface objects called widgets.

OSF/Motif User Interface Programming Support

OSF/Motif is the user interface for Digital and third-party software tailored
for the DECwindows environment. It establishes the conventions and styles
for graphical applications. Applications use Motif components to build user
interfaces that look and feel alike.

 DECwindows Motif[R]   Japanese Version 1.2-4 for OpenVMS        SPD 28.A8.03



The OSF/Motif Style Guide describes the principles, philosophy, and
components used to build consistent and well-integrated OSF/Motif
applications. In addition, the DECwindows Companion to the OSF/Motif Style
Guide provides additional information concerning the style of OSF/Motif
user interfaces. This manual also provides guidelines concerning additional
features that Digital provides in the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS offering,
and includes a Digital preferred terminology list for a number of supported
languages for developers producing OSF/Motif applications in these languages.

The OSF/Motif style concepts are implemented by the OSF/Motif Toolkit.
DECwindows Motif contains both the OSF/Motif and XUI Toolkits; application
run-time support is provided for CDE Motif 1.0 (OSF/Motif Release 1.2.5)
and OSF/Motif Release 1.2.3, Release 1.2.2, and Release 1.1.3 Toolkits, as
well as for the XUI Toolkit. The OSF/Motif toolkit is based on the X Toolkit
Intrinsics and contains three components:

o  OSF/Motif widgets and gadgets for implementing common user interface
   objects, such as scroll bars, menus, and push buttons

o  Utility routines that provide applications with functions for performing
   common tasks, such as cutting and pasting

o  Resource manager routines for loading user interface definition files and
   creating widgets and gadgets based on the contents of the definition files

The OSF/Motif Toolkit is used in conjunction with the OSF/Motif User
Interface Language (UIL) compiler. The user interface definition files
produced by this compiler contain the data that describes the form of
DECwindows applications. These UIL files also allow OSF/Motif Toolkit widget
and gadget information, such as menu item labels, to be stored separately
from the toolkit and application run-time code. This capability allows
application developers to prototype and easily modify user interface designs,
to separate form from function in applications, and to support translatable
products that do not require recompilation of source files.

Digital Extensions to OSF/Motif

DECwindows Motif[R]   Japanese Version 1.2-4 for OpenVMS        SPD 28.A8.03



The DECwindows Motif/Japanese product adds value to the standard OSF/Motif
Toolkit by including a library that contains a set of Digital developed
widgets and run-time routines not available from OSF. The following widgets
provide a common DECwindows interface for some commonly used DECwindows
functions:

o  A Color Mix widget that enables users to select and mix colors using a
   variety of color models.

o  A Compound String Text widget that provides support for international
   right-to-left character sets as well as left-to-right character sets.

o  A Help widget that allows applications to display appropriate Help text in
   a consistent manner. This widget is provided for backward compatibility
   with DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS Version 1.0 and has been superseded by
   the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS help system (hyperhelp).

o  A Print widget that allows applications to print files in a consistent
   manner.

The run-time routines include:

o  Three DECwindows Motif/Japanese for OpenVMS help system calls that enable
   users to display online help files using Bookreader.

o  DECimage run-time support for applications developed using DECimage
   Application Services. This support includes the Image Services Library,
   Image Display Services, and X Image Extensions.

Translated Image Environment for DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS Alpha

DECwindows Motif/Japanese for OpenVMS Alpha provides an array of services
to allow the operation of programs that have undergone binary translation
from DECwindows Motif Version 1.1 or XUI VAX images. These programs can
perform virtually all user-mode functions on DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS
Alpha systems. However, DECwindows Motif/Japanese for OpenVMS Alpha
shareable images that are used with translated images are different from
and incompatible with the shareable images used for native images. Native
and translated images that use DECwindows Motif/Japanese for OpenVMS Alpha
software cannot be used together in a process.

 DECwindows Motif[R]   Japanese Version 1.2-4 for OpenVMS        SPD 28.A8.03



Without requiring special source code, the Translated Image Environment (TIE)
automatically resolves differences between the VAX and Alpha architectures,
including floating-point registers, condition codes, exception handling,
ASTs, and others.

The Translated Image Environment included with DECwindows Motif/Japanese
for OpenVMS Alpha is sufficient to run images that have been translated
elsewhere. The DECmigrate layered product can be used to translate images
linked with the OSF/Motif Release 1.1.3 Toolkit (shipped with DECwindows
Motif/Japanese Version 1.1 for OpenVMS VAX) for running on an OpenVMS Alpha
system. For additional information about the precise characteristics of
programs suitable for binary translation, refer to the DECmigrate Software
Product Description (SPD 39.44.xx for VAX; SPD 39.45.xx for Alpha).

XUI to Motif Porting Tools

Digital provides tools to aid programmers in porting applications to Motif.
These tools replace occurrences of XUI names in the input source file with
the correct Motif names.

3  HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

DECwindows Motif/Japanese runs on any of the supported processors but
requires either a workstation, an MS-DOS[R] based PC, a Macintosh[R], or an
X terminal for display. These display devices must be running an X Window
System, Version 11, Release 4 (R4) or Release 5 (R5) compliant display
server.

3.0.1  Supported VAX and Alpha Processors

DECwindows Motif supports all the AVX and Alpha processors listed in the
OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha operating system Software Product Descriptions

the user the option of installing any or all of the following components:

o  DECwindows Motif run-time support files (base kit) - 24,000 blocks.
   This section provides support for running DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS
   VAX applications on VAX compute servers, and is a required part of
   the installation. It includes the DECwindows desktop applications and
   libraries.

o  Keymaps-200 blocks. This option provides support for Japanese specific
   keyboards.

o  75 DPI fonts-16,800 blocks. Japanese display fonts for 75 DPI (Dots Per
   Inch) display.
