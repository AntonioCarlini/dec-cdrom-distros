     PRODUCT NAME:  DEC RdbAccess for VAX RMS on VMS, Version 1.0 SPD
     32.88.00

     DESCRIPTION

     DEC RdbAccess for VAX RMS on VMS (RdbAccess for VAX RMS) is a
     member of the DEC RdbAccess family of database interoperabil-
     ity products. It permits transparent, read-only access to VAX
     RMS files via the VAX implementation of the Structured Query
     Language (VAX Rdb/VMS SQL). It also permits SQL read-only ac-
     cess to data sets on IBM[R] MVS systems via the DECnet/SNA Data
     Transfer Facility (DTF). RdbAccess for VAX RMS retrieves the
     data definitions for the information contained in these files
     from VAX CDD/Plus. RdbAccess for VAX RMS emulates a relational
     database, and enables SQL access by combining the source data
     and its associated definitions.

     RdbAccess for VAX RMS can be used in conjunction with products
     such as VAX TEAMDATA, DECdecision, and Rdb/VMS utilities in-
     cluding interactive SQL. It can also be used in conjunction with
     VAX Data Distributor and VAX Rdb/VMS SQL/Services as well as 3GL
     applications with embedded SQL.

     Components

     Non-SQL Data Server

     The Non-SQL Data Server is the component which brings data and
     their definitions (metadata) together and makes them appear
     relational. The Non-SQL Data Server enables applications to
     access this non-relational data in a relational manner using
     VAX Rdb/VMS SQL. The Non-SQL Data Server supports read-only
     operations.

     VAX RMS Driver

     The VAX RMS driver contains the code specific to accessing
     VAX RMS files and IBM MVS data sets. It utilizes optimization
     techniques in accessing the data when appropriate.

     Features

     o  RdbAccess for VAX RMS provides direct read-only SQL access to
        VAX RMS files, and to certain IBM MVS data sets (including
        VSAM) via the DECnet/SNA Data Transfer Facility. For more
        information, refer to the DECnet/SNA Data Transfer Facility
        Software Product Description (SPD 27.85.xx).

     o  VAX CDD/Plus is used as the source of data definitions (meta-
        data). Users either enter the definitions directly into VAX
        CDD/Plus, or instruct RdbAccess for VAX RMS to use existing
        definitions that have been created (for example, by products
        such as VAX DATATRIEVE).

     o  Users can perform relational operations such as joins, se-
        lects, sorts, and projects. These operations can be done on
        multiple VAX RMS files, or on multiple IBM MVS data sets.

     o  VAX RMS indexed, sequential and relative files are supported.

     o  VAX RMS record formats (one type per file) are supported as
        follows:

        -  fixed-length: fully supported

        -  variable-length with fixed length control: **

        -  variable-length: **

        -  stream: **

        -  undefined: not supported

        ** support for the fixed portion of each record that is
           defined in VAX CDD/Plus

     o  Using RdbAccess for VAX RMS with VAX Data Distributor, VAX
        RMS data and IBM MVS data sets can be extracted and stored in
        VAX Rdb/VMS relations. For more information, refer to the VAX
        Data Distributor Software Product Description (SPD 27.76.xx).

     o  By means of VAX Rdb/VMS SQL/Services application programming
        interface (API), applications on VMS, ULTRIX, OS/2[R], Mac-
        intosh[R] and MS-DOS[R] can access VAX RMS files and IBM MVS
        data sets. For more information, refer to the VAX Rdb/VMS
        Software Product Description (SPD 25.59.xx).

     o  VAX RMS files and IBM MVS data can be accessed directly
        from VAX-based third generation language (3GL) programs
        using the VAX Rdb/VMS data access sublanguages, embedded
        SQL, SQL module language, or dynamic SQL. These data access
        sublanguages are the same sublanguages used to access VAX
        Rdb/VMS data relations and views. The VAX Rdb/VMS development
        option is required to develop 3GL applications that use
        RdbAccess for VAX RMS. VAX Rdb/VMS provides SQL precompiler
        support for languages such as Ada, C, COBOL, FORTRAN, and
        PL/I. SQL module language can be used with any language that
        supports the VMS calling standard. Refer to the VAX Rdb/VMS
        Software Product Description (SPD 25.59.xx) for a complete
        description of programming language support.

     o  When RdbAccess for VAX RMS is used with VAX TEAMDATA or
        DECdecision, end users can access VAX RMS and IBM MVS data
        directly, join it with Rdb/VMS tables, store the results in
        TEAMDATA, or DECdecision folders, etc. for use in decision
        support and other personal and departmental applications.

     o  RdbAccess for VAX RMS provides a facility that can trace file
        access activity, log errors, and help to isolate problems.
