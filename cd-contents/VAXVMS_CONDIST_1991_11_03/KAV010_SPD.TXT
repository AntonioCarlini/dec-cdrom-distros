           PRODUCT NAME:  VAXELN KAV Toolkit Extensions   SPD 34.18.00
                          for VMS, Version 1.0

           DESCRIPTION

           The VAXELN KAV Toolkit Extensions for VMS is a VMS layered
           product. It can be used in conjunction with the VAXELN Toolkit
           to develop dedicated realtime systems to run on the KAV30
           module

           The KAV30 is a VMEbus based, VAX realtime single board com-
           puter that runs a user's ELN system. It is based on the rt-
           VAX300 processor daughter module which contains a 2.7 VUP
           CMOS processor, a CMOS VAX floating-point coprocessor, a CMOS
           second generation Ethernet coprocessor, VSB, optional SCSI
           controller and 4 MB or 16 MB of memory.

           With the KAV30, a user can now put a VAX on the VMEbus, in-
           tegrating the application into Digital Equipment Corpora-
           tion's extensive computing and networking environment. Data
           can be communicated to and from devices on a DECnet or TCP/IP
           network providing a means of total integration from the re-
           altime device to the data center.

           For the KAV30, the user develops the application on a VAX
           VMS Host Development System using the VAXELN Toolkit and the
           VAXELN KAV Toolkit Extensions. The application can then be
           built into an ELN Target System, which can be down-line loaded
           into a KAV30 over an Ethernet, booted from SCSI disk, or booted
           from EPROM.

           VAXELN KAV Toolkit Extensions for VMS,      SPD 34.18.00
           Version 1.0

           Since the VAXELN KAV30 Toolkit Extensions are an extension
           to the VAXELN Toolkit, users have the features and benefits
           standard with VAXELN. In addition, the VAXELN KAV30 Toolkit
           Extensions provides software to simplify the programming of
           the KAV30 module. It provides kernel procedures to initial-
           ize the KAV30 module, set up and control access to VME and
           VSB devices, set up and control communication FIFOs, write
           and read Non Volatile RAM, utilize ASTs in user written de-
           vice drivers and initialize the KAV30 module. The KAV30 soft-
           ware also includes asynchronous event notification (ASTs)
           for the realtime clock and timers.
