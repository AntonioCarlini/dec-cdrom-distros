           PRODUCT NAME:  OSI Application Developer's  SPD 34.98.00
                          Toolkit, Version  1.0
          

           DESCRIPTION

           OSI Applications Developer's Toolkit enables users to write
           distributed applications that communicate over open networks
           and use the OSI services provided by DECnet-VAX and DECnet
           /OSI for ULTRIX.

           The Toolkit provides an application development environment
           which consists of the following:

           o  An interface to FTAM (File Transfer, Access and Manage-
              ment).

           o  Interfaces to the ACSE and Presentation layers (VMS only).

           o  ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) tools (VMS only).

           o  Example programs.

           The Toolkit permits the application writers to use the ser-
           vices of the OSI upper layers in their applications.

           The Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provide ac-
           cess to the OSI services supported by the underlying DEC-
           net system.

           The ASN.1 tools provide a compiler and a library of encode
           /decode routines.

           The Toolkit supports application development on both VMS and
           ULTRIX for applications to be run on:

           o  DECnet-VAX (with the DECnet-VAX Extensions options), or

           Version 1.0 


           o  DECnet/OSI for ULTRIX

           DECnet-VAX

           The OSI components of DECnet-VAX Extensions support APIs for:

           o  FTAM

           o  Application Control Service Element (ACSE)

           o  Presentation

           DECnet/OSI for ULTRIX

           The OSI components of DECnet/OSI for ULTRIX support APIs for:

           o  FTAM

           Standards Supported

           FTAM

           FTAM supports the OSI standard:

           o  ISO 8571 - Information Processing Systems - Open Systems
              Interconnection - File Transfer, Access and Management

           The FTAM API provides the interface to the FTAM protocol ma-
           chine provided in DECnet/OSI. Communications between the ap-
           plication code and the FTAM protocol machine are carried out
           using ASN.1 encoded data structures. The API supports the
           following functions:

           o  Abort

           o  Begin-Group

           o  Cancel

           o  Change-Attributes

           ACSE

           The Application Control Service Entity (ACSE) supports the
           OSI standards:

           o  ISO 8650 - Information Processing Systems - Open Systems
              Interconnection - Protocol Specification for the Asso-
              ciation Control Service Element.

           o  ISO 8649 - Information Processing Systems - Open Systems
              Interconnection - Service Definition for the Association
              Control Service Element.

           The ACSE API provides the interface to the associate and re-
           lease services. The services provided are:

           o  Associate

           o  Release

           o  Abort

           o  Redirect

           The redirect service is not an ACSE service. It allows ap-
           plications to redirect an incoming association to another
           process on the local system.

           Presentation

           Presentation supports the OSI standards

           o  ISO 8823 - Information Processing Systems - Open Systems
              Interconnection - Connection Oriented Presentation Pro-
              tocol Specification

           o  ISO 8822 - Information Processing Systems - Open Systems
              Interconnection - Connection Oriented Presentation Ser-
              vice Definition

           o  ISO 8327 - Information Processing Systems - Open Systems
              Interconnection - Basic Connection Oriented Session Pro-
              tocol Specification

           o  ISO 8326 - Information Processing Systems - Open Systems
              Interconnection - Basic Connection Oriented Session Ser-
              vice Definition

           The Presentation API provides the interface to the Presen-
           tation layer services and, by pass through, to the equiv-
           alent Session layer services. The API supports the follow-
           ing services:

           o  Alter-Context

           o  Data

           o  Capability-Data

           o  Expedited-Data

           The Session layer supports ISO Session, Version 1 and Ver-
           sion 2. ISO Session Version 1 allows up to 512 octets of user
           data on a service. ISO Session Version 2 supports the re-
           strictions imposed by the National Institute of Standards
           and Technology allowing up to 10,240 octets of data on a ser-
           vice.

           ASN.1

           The Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) tools are based on
           the following OSI standards:

           o  ISO 8824 - Information Processing Systems - Open Systems
              Interconnection - Specification of Abstract Syntax No-
              tation One (ASN.1)

           o  ISO 8825 - Information Processing Systems - Open Systems
              Interconnection - Specification of Basic Encoding Rules
              for Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)

           ASN.1 tools provide an ASN.1 compiler (or syntax generator)
           and a library of encode/decode routines.

           Version 1.0 


           The compiler takes an ASN.1 source file describing a tar-
           get syntax and generates either a C format syntax table or
           an object format syntax table. The syntax table describes
           the grammar in a format that the ASN.1 library routines can
           use.

           The ASN.1 library provides routines that process data en-
           coded in the target syntax. The routines can read a data stream
           encoded in the target syntax, or generate a data stream in
           the target syntax.

           ASN.1 tools also include the following:

           o  Syntactic and semantic analysis of ASN.1 data syntax spec-
              ification

           o  Encoding of default values in the generated syntax ta-
              bles

           o  Support of all ASN.1 UNIVERSAL data types

           o  Macro support, as defined by ISO 8824 Annex A
