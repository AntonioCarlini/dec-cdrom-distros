     PRODUCT NAME:  PDP-11 C for VMS, Version 1.1        SPD 31.54.01

     DESCRIPTION

     PDP-11 C is a reliable language processor for Digital Equipment
     Corporation's proprietary operating systems on the PDP-11. It
     is highly compatible with the ANSI standard for the C language.
     PDP-11 C can be used to develop code for inclusion into resident
     libraries, and other low level system routines.

     PDP-11 C for VMS consists of a compiler, a Run-Time Library
     (RTL) and documentation.

     The compiler produces machine code optimized for execution speed
     and memory efficiency. It is highly compatible with the ANSI
     C standard, X3J11/90-013 February 14, 1990, and extends beyond
     ANSI requirements with several extensions for the PDP-11 family
     of central processors.

     The compiler runs in native mode, as a cross compiler, on the
     host VMS environment and produces PDP-11 object code compatible
     with all the supported target systems. These target systems
     are RSX-11M, RSX-11S, RSX-11M-PLUS, Micro/RSX, RSTS/E, RT-11
     (SJ, FB, XM), VAX-11 RSX, and VAX CoProcessor/RSX. The Run-Time
     Library is provided in object form.

     The Run-Time Library provides run-time support that allows the
     user to perform many needed functions not provided from within
     the compiler itself. These features include:

     o  Native Standard I/O (STDIO) for each supported PDP-11 operat-
        ing system

     o  Arithmetic Operations

     o  Character Handling

                                  DIGITAL                January 1991

                                                          AE-NY61B-TE

     o  Localization

     o  Signal Handling

     o  Variable Arguments

     o  String handling

     To build and run a task in the VMS environment requires that
     VAX-11 RSX or VAX CoProcessor/RSX be installed. In the case
     where the user does not wish to link or run on VMS, either
     DECnet or a physical media copy may be used to transport the
     generated object code to the target PDP-11 system. Each RTL
     furnished with the VMS kit is transportable to the supported
     target system.

     Features

     o  Compatible with the ANSI C Standard (February 1990)

     o  Function prototypes for declaring and checking function
        argument count and types

     o  Structured programming control flow constructs:

        -  if...else construct for simple selection

        -  switch statement for multi-choice selection with an arbi-
           trary number of case statements

        -  while, do, and for statements for iterative execution

     o  Flow modification statements:

        -  break

        -  continue

        -  goto

     o  Data type for numeric, non-numeric, and systems programming:

        -  Byte, word, and longword signed and unsigned integers

        -  Integer constants in decimal, octal, and hexadecimal
           radices
