           PRODUCT NAME: DEC X.25gateway 100/500,      SPD 32.97.00
                         Version 1.0

           DESCRIPTION

           Introduction

           The DEC X.25gateway 100/500 is a software product that runs
           on either the DEC MicroServer (DEMSA) or DEC MicroServer-
           SP (DEMSB) hardware unit. It provides both Digital and non-
           Digital X.25 systems with connections to X.25 Packet Switched
           Data Networks (PSDNs) and provides X.25 relay and switch-
           ing capabilities locally for both Digital and non-Digital
           X.25 systems. The combined hardware/software packages are
           known as the DEC X.25gateway 500 and DEC X.25gateway 100 re-
           spectively.

           Overview

           When used with the DEC MicroServer-SP or DEC MicroServer hard-
           ware, the DEC X.25gateway 100/500 software operates either
           as an X.25 Connector system or as an X.25 Relay system.

           o  X.25 Connector system

              The DEC X.25gateway 100/500 connects any suitably con-
              figured Digital X.25 Client systems in the DECnet/OSI net-
              work to X.25 Packet Switched Data Networks (PSDNs).

           o  X.25 Relay system

              The DEC X.25gateway 100/500 allows X.25 systems on the
              same Local Area Network (LAN) to access PSDNs using the
              ISO Logical Link Control Type 2 (LLC2) protocol. In X.25

           DEC X.25gateway 100/500, Version 1.0        SPD 32.97.00


              Relay mode, the DEC X.25gateway 100/500 acts as a CONS
              LAN/WAN Relay in accordance with ISO TR 10029.

           The DEC X.25gateway 100/500 software also provides local switch-
           ing facilities to allow DTEs connected directly to a DEC X.25gateway
           500 to communicate as though they were linked across a PSDN.

           Note: When operating as an X.25 Relay, the DEC X.25gateway
           100/500 software does not allow DTEs on one public PSDN to
           be switched to DTEs on another PSDN. However, in the case
           of private PSDNs, this may be possible, depending on the con-
           figuration of the PSDN.

           System Overview

           The system is a combination of hardware and software. The
           DEC X.25gateway 100 hardware package combines the DEC MicroServer-
           SP (DEMSB) communications server and the DEC X.25gateway 100
           /500 software license; the DEC X.25gateway 500 hardware pack-
           age combines the DEC MicroServer (DEMSA) communications server
           and the DEC X.25gateway 100/500 software license.

                 from suitably configured systems using DECnet/OSI NCL.

           Network and Configuration Management

           The network manager can create and modify the configuration
           file by using utilities that are part of the load host soft-
           ware. The configuration file is loaded into the DEC X.25gateway
           100/500 during system initialization.

           DEC X.25gateway 100/500, Version 1.0        SPD 32.97.00


           The network manager controls the running system by using the
           DECnet/OSI Network Control Utility (NCL) from any DECnet/OSI
           Phase V systems.

           The NCL utility provides three basic functions:

           o  Controls the DEC X.25gateway 100/500 (for example, start-
              ing and stopping lines, setting parameters, and loading
              the software)

           o  Display statistics and error information for the DEC X.25gateway
              100/500 (for example, statistics on line usage or errors)

           o  Tests the components of the network (for example, loop
              messages through all or part of a communications path to
              isolate a defective component)

           In addition, the DECnet/OSI CTF tracing utility assists problem-
           solving by tracing information at various stages in its path
           through the DEC X.25gateway 100/500.

           Host Systems

           The DEC X.25gateway 100/500 has no file storage of its own
           and requires one or more host systems to:

           o  Load the software

           o  Configure the system with the software

           o  Log events

           o  Receive any memory dumps

           The minimum requirement is for one load host. Event-logging
           and dump reception facilities can be used at the discretion
           of the network manager. Although any suitable DECnet Phase
           IV system on the same LAN can be a load host or dump receiver,
           only a DECnet/OSI Phase V End System on the same LAN can be
           used to configure and manage the DEC X.25gateway 100/500;
           DECnet Phase IV systems are not supported for configuration
           and management.

           DEC X.25gateway 100/500, Version 1.0        SPD 32.97.00


           Digital recommends that DEC X.25gateway 100/500 software is
           installed on a number of load hosts. This helps to protect
           against loss of service if a single load host is unavail-
           able or unable to load the system for any other reason. Each
           load host must be on the same LAN, but not necessarily in
           the same DECnet/OSI area as the DEC X.25gateway 100/500.

           Supported Public Networks

           The System Support Addendum (SSA 32.97.00 ) lists the pub-
           lic PSDNs that are supported by the DEC X.25gateway 100/500.
           The product is supported only on the public PSDNs in the coun-
           tries shown. Connections to public networks not listed are
           not supported by Digital at the time of publication of this
           SPD. Please consult your local Digital office for any ques-
           tions you have concerning other public PSDNs.

           In addition to the public PSDNs listed in the SSA, certain
           private PSDNs are supported by the DEC X.25gateway 100/500,
           and the appropriate profiles are included in the DEC X.25gateway
           100/500 product.

           Conformance to Standards

           The DEC X.25gateway 100/500 conforms to the following in-
           ternational standards:

           o  CCITT Recommendation X.25 (1978, 1980, or 1984) using the
              LAPB or LAPBE variants of the X.25 packet level and data
              link protocols

           o  ISO 8208 - X.25 Packet Level Protocol for Data Terminal
              Equipment

           o  ISO 7776 - HDLC Procedures: X.25 LAPB compatible DTE Data
              Link Procedures

           o  ISO 3309 - HDLC frame generation and structure[1]

           _________________

         [1] HDLC protocol and BSC framing are not supported

           DEC X.25gateway 100/500, Version 1.0        SPD 32.97.00


           o  ISO 8881 - Use of X.25 Packet Level Protocol in Local Area
              networks (LLC2)

           o  ISO TR 10029 - Operation of an X.25 Interworking Unit (CONS
              LAN/WAN Relay)

           The hardware can operate with a number of electrical inter-
           face standards (refer to Table 1). The DEC X.25gateway 100
           /500 provides only the electrical interface of a DTE rather
           than a DCE, and does not provide clock signals. An exter-
           nal clock source (such as a modem) is required for each syn-
           chronous connection.

           Optional X.25 Facilities

           The X.25 recommendation covers a wide range of optional fa-
           cilities. Table 3 lists these facilities and indicates whether
           the DEC X.25gateway 100/500 supports each of them. The cen-
           ter column is the paragraph number in CCITT Recommendation
           X.25 (1984) that defines the facility.

           The features in Table 3 are those that the DEC X.25gateway
           100/500 provides across its service interface. Each of these
           features is available to connected DTEs. Performance and Con-
           figuration

           The DEC X.25gateway 100/500 can be set up in a number of ways.
           The number of synchronous links supported on the system de-
           pends on the maximum line speed in use. Line speeds from 1200
           bps to 256 Kbps are supported. On the four-line DEC MicroServer
           (DEMSA), line speeds may be mixed and matched providing the
           aggregate line speed does not exceed the total capacity of
           the box (512 Kbps).

           Table 1 shows the number of lines supported for each com-
           bination of line speed and electrical interface type.

           For the DEC X.25gateway 100, the concurrent number of SVCs
           refers to the number of SVCs the system is capable of sup-
           porting concurrently without affecting data transmission.
           This is also equivalent to the maintainable and maximum num-
           bers of SVCs supported. For the DEC X.25gateway 500, the main-
           tainable number of SVCs refers to the number of SVCs the sys-
           tem is capable of supporting while sustaining an acceptable
           data transmission rate, while the maximum number of SVCs refers
           to the number of SVCs the system is physically capable of
           supporting at a significantly reduced data transmission rate.

           Performance

           The actual packet rate may be less than that indicated by
           the aggregate synchronous line speed, and is determined by
           such factors as:

           o  Type of traffic and data rates

           o  Communications line characteristics

           o  Frequency and type of errors on the synchronous links

           o  DECnet/OSI Network topology

           o  Protocol overhead

           o  Call setup rate

           sure that they understand and adhere to these controls for
           each and every network.

           Before the software is installed, the customer must:

           o  Previously have installed all requisite software and hard-
              ware (including terminals needed for the installation).

           o  Obtain, install, and demonstrate as operational any modems
              and other equipment and facilities necessary to inter-
              face to Digital's communication equipment.

           DEC X.25gateway 100/500, Version 1.0        SPD 32.97.00


           o  Demonstrate where necessary that modems used meet the ap-
              propriate interface standards.

           o  For connection to PSDNs: subscribe to the Open User Group
              and to at least two SVCs to be able to complete the prod-
              uct's installation checkout (this test loops information
              from the DEC X.25gateway 100/500 to the PSDN and back to
              the DEC X.25gateway 100/500). Systems that use PVCs or
              Closed User Groups only, or where the PSDN does not sup-
              port calls to the same DTE address, require specially ne-
              gotiated arrangements for Digital installation of the prod-
              uct.

           o  Make available for a reasonable period of time, as mu-
              tually agreed by Digital and the customer, all the hard-
              ware (including terminals), software, and communications
              facilities needed during the installation.

           Delays caused by failure to fulfill any of these responsi-
           bilities will be charged at the then prevailing rate for time
           and materials.

           Courtesy Installation Service

           This software product will be installed by Digital at no ad-
           ditional charge if you purchase it concurrently with a Startup
           Service Package that includes installation service. This ser-
           vice may not be available in all countries.

           SOFTWARE LICENSING

           A separate license is needed for each DEC MicroServer or DEC
           MicroServer-SP unit on which the software is used (except
           as otherwise specified by Digital).

           The licensing provisions of Digital Equipment Corporation's
           Standard Terms and Conditions provide, in part, that the soft-
           ware and any part thereof (but excluding those parts spe-
           cific to the load hosts) may be used only on the single DEC
           MicroServer hardware unit on which the software is operated,
           but may be copied, in whole or in part (with the proper in-
           clusion of Digital's copyright notice and any proprietary
           notices on the software) between multiple load hosts on the
           same LAN.

           This software is furnished under the licensing provisions
           of Digital Equipment Corporation's Terms and Conditions. For
           more information about Digital's licensing terms and poli-
           cies, contact your local Digital office.

           Notes:

           1. This is not applicable to a DTE. This product does not
              support the reception of a level 3 Reject packet, and will
              not generate one.

           2. Each DTE must be assigned a unique address independent
              of the hunt group address. The DEC X.25gateway 100/500
              can then ignore the hunt group. Alternatively, each line
              can be configured as if it were connected to a separate
              PSDN with each line having the same DTE address. In ei-
              ther case, all the lines must be connected to the same
              DEC X.25gateway 100/500.

           3. This product does not generate these statistics. However,
              an X.25 Client system can obtain statistics supplied by
              the PSDN through the programming interface.

           /782

           Processor Restrictions:

           Processor Restrictions (VMS and ULTRIX Load Host Systems):

           A TK50 tape drive is required for standalone MicroVAX 2000
           and VAXstation 2000 systems.

           Each load host on which the DEC X.25gateway 100/500 soft-
           ware is installed must contain:

           o  A valid system configuration for the relevant operating
              system and for the appropriate DECnet product (refer to
              the DECnet and appropriate operating system SPDs).

           o  A supported connection on the same LAN as the DEC X.25gateway
              100/500.

           o  An appropriate device available to read the software dur-
              ing installation.

           o  MT9 MAGNETIC tape drive or TK50 magnetic tape drive.

           Other Hardware Required

           The DEC X.25gateway 100/500 software requires the DEC Mi-
           croServer (DEMSA) or DEC MicroServer-SP (DEMSB) hardware unit,
           available as follows:

           o  DEMSA-AA for use with 120 V AC power supplies

                                       3

 



           DEC X.25gateway 100/500, Version 1.0      SSA 32.97.00-A


           o  DEMSA-AB for use with 240 V AC power supplies

           o  DEMSB-AA for use with 120 V AC power supplies

           o  DEMSB-AB for use with 240 V AC power supplies

           The DEC MicroServer and DEC MicroServer-SP have a built-in
           LAN controller, however, a suitable connection to connect
           to the customer's LAN is necessary, together with any nec-
           essary extension cables. Adapter cables are used to provide
           the necessary interchange circuits at the appropriate elec-
           trical interface types and ISO standard connections for each
           synchronous line. A cable is needed for each line used. The
           following table shows the cable numbers for each of the elec-
           trical interface types.

           Note: The DEC MicroServer-SP is provided with a V.28/V.24
           cable as standard.

           The BS19D-02 cable provides the V.28/V.24 (RS232-D) inter-
           face, but is supplied with an adapter that allows it to be
           used for RS232-C as well.

           The DEC X.25gateway 100/500 synchronous ports do not pro-
           vide clock signals; an external clock source (such as a mo-
           dem) is required.

           Block Space Requirements

           Disk space requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1) for VAX and
           MicroVAX Operating Systems:

           Disk space required    2,700 blocks
           for installation       (1382 Kbytes)

           Disk space required    7,700 blocks
           for operation          (3942 Kbytes)

           Disk space requirements for ULTRIX Operating Systems:
