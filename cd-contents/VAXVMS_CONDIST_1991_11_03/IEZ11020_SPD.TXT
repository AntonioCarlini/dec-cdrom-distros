           PRODUCT NAME:  DEC IEZ11 Class Driver for VMS,        SPD
           31.41.01                Version 2.0

           DESCRIPTION

           The DEC IEZ11 Class Driver is a VMS layered product that is
           part of the IEZ11 option. The IEZ11 option includes the SCSI488
           /D bus converter and the IEZ11 software.

           The DEC IEZ11 Class Driver allows an application written in
           a higher level language or in Macro 32 to monitor, control,
           and interface with IEEE488 devices using VMS QIO system calls.
           The driver adheres to the VMS SCSI device architecture.

           The IEZ11 driver supports most functions of the IEx11 driver.
           The majority of IEx11 applications can be converted to run
           on the IEZ11 with only minor modifications.

           Installation Test and Demo Software (ITADS) is included in
           the software kit. It provides a means of verifying that the
           IEZ11 hardware and software are functioning properly and can
           be used as an application development and debug tool. Also
           included is the IEZ11 Exerciser Software, which is a DECwin-
           dows/Motif® application for the execution of IEZ11 functions;
           it can be used to build small test and debugging scripts.

           The SCSI488/D bus converter is an external box that provides
           the capability of connecting an IEEE488 bus to the SCSI bus
           of a VAXstation or a MicroVAX. The SCSI488/D bus converter,
           software, and license are ordered under a single part num-
           ber.

           DEC IEZ11 Class Driver for VMS,             SPD 31.41.01
           Version 2.0

           The maximum number of SCSI488/D bus converters that can be
           supported on a single SCSI bus is 6. This number is reduced
           by 1 for every I/O unit that resides on the SCSI bus. For
           example, on a VAXstation 3100 with dual RZ23's, one TK50,
           and one RD40, two IEZ11's could be supported. As with all
           SCSI buses, other factors including cable length and qual-
           ity can affect the actual number of SCSI devices that can
           be supported.

           The IEZ11 is supported under the DEC Realtime Test Integra-
           tor (DEC RT Integrator), which is an icon-based graphical
           programming environment available on VAX and RISC platforms.
           Instead of using a conventional programming language, the
           DEC RT Integrator allows scientists and engineers to cre-
           ate and run real-time applications by drawing them graph-
           ically as flow diagrams.

           HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

           VAX, MicroVAX, VAXstation, or VAXserver configuration as spec-
           ified in the System Support Addendum (SSA 31.41.01-x).
