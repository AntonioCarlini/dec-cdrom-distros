PRODUCT NAME:  VAXELN KMV1A Tool Kit, Version 1.1          SPD 29.17.01

DESCRIPTION

The VAXELN KMV1A Tool Kit is designed to allow the development of KMV1A
control programs for KMV1As in MicroVAX VAXELN systems.  This package
includes software that is used to create KMV1A control program images on a
VAX host system, VAXELN KMV1A Load and Dump Programs, and a KMV1A 
network Debug package that allows the testing and debugging of KMV1A control 
programs from a VAX host system. 

The VAXELN KMV1A Tool Kit is designed to operate with the VAXELN Toolkit and
the VMS RSX Emulation products. 

Features

^  Automated KMV1A control program image generation

^  VAXELN KMV1A Load Program

   - Load KMV1A control programs from local or network mass storage

   - Load KMV1A Debugger into KMV1A

   - Optionally Master Clear KMV1A

^  VAXELN KMV1A Dump Program

  - Application program commands stopping and dumping of KMV1A for real-time 
    snapshot of KMV1A state

  - KMV1A dump stored on local or network mass storage

  - KMV1A dump examined with standard VMS Dump/Analyze Program

^  Remote Debug

  - Network debugging.  The host VAX must have an Ethernet connection to 
    MicroVAX with KMV1A installed.  Debug strategy follows VAXELN Network 
    Debug model.

  - Operator interface program that executes on VAX/VMS host system

  - VAXELN Debug Server Program that operates communications channel through 
    MicroVAX in which a KMV1A is installed.  Debug Server connects an operator 
    interface on Ethernetted VAX/VMS system through Ethernetted MicroVAX to 
    KMV1A.

  - KMV1A Debug Service Module executes in KMV1A to provide ODT-type 
    debugging.  Debug Service Module may be linked into KMV1A control 
    program or loaded into KMV1A independently.
