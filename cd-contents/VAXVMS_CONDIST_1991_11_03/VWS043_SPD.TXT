     PRODUCT NAME:  VMS Workstation Software, Version 4.3SPD 28.06.11

     DESCRIPTION

     VMS Workstation Software (VWS) is a VMS layered product that
     provides windowing and graphics support for the VAXstation
     II, VAXstation II/GPX, VAXstation 2000, VAXstation 3100 Models
     30/40/38/48 with GPX graphics and VAXstation 3200/3500.

     VWS supports VAXstations with windowing, VT200 series ter-
     minal emulation with technical character set, TEK4014[R] and
     TEK4125[R] terminal emulation, a simple mouse-based human inter-
     face for window manipulation, a graphics programming interface,
     Hard Copy (HCUIS) for applications requiring hardcopy output,
     VWS/SIGHT, an easy-to-use tool that enables the user to create
     graphics, and a Migration Tools kit to assist users in migrating
     UIS applications to the DECwindows platform.

     Features

     o  Multiple Overlapping Windowing System-Via the mouse, multiple
        windows can be created, moved, overlapped and resized at
        will. Windows can be popped to the top of the screen or
        pushed to the bottom of the screen stacking order. Windows
        can also be created and manipulated under program control.

     o  VT200 series terminal and TEK4014,
        TEK4125 Emulation-Multiple VT200, series terminals, TEK4014
        or TEK4125 windows can be present on the screen at the same
        time.

     o  ReGIS Color Support-Provides VT240-compatible subset of
        video-ReGIS graphics. Hardcopy output is provided only
        through the UIS print screen service.

     o  Simple User Interface-Via the mouse, the keyboard can be
        switched to an alternate window, new VT200-series windows
        created, or the screen printed to an LA100, LA120, LA210,
        LA324, LA50, LA70, LA75 or LJ250 hardcopy devices.

     o  Workstation Setup-Enables the workstation characteristics to
        be configured to customer requirements.

     o  On-line Help is available on the user interface.

     o  Programming Interface-For workstation application develop-
        ment, a graphics and windowing programming interface called
        User Interface Service (UIS) is provided.

     o  Device Driver Interface-For applications with special re-
        quirements, a device driver interface to the graphics hard-
        ware is provided.

     o  Hardcopy Graphics Support-For applications requiring the
        generation of hardcopy output of graphics, Hardcopy UIS
        (HCUIS) is provided. HCUIS enables applications to translate
        UIS display lists to the formats needed to print them on a
        variety of hardcopy devices. The HCUIS routines also enable
        applications to create UIS files from the UIS display list.
        The HCUIS DCL interface also enables users to translate UIS
        files to the formats needed to print them on a variety of
        hardcopy devices.

     o  SIGHT (Simple Interactive Graphics Handling Tool)-Enables the
        user to create graphics on a workstation. These graphics are
        stored in files for graphic output to hardcopy devices. These
        files can then be updated and/or transferred/copied to other
        supported VAXstations.

     VWS to DECwindows Migration Tools

     VAXuisx Run_Time Library for VMS, Version 1.0-allows most appli-
     cations written for the VWS windowing system to run under the
     DECwindows windowing system. VAXuisx accomplishes this by pro-
     viding a new run-time library that uses the Xlib program inter-
     face for drawing and input services. UIS routines are redirected

                                     2

 






     to the new UISXSHR run-time image. Therefore, most applications
     do not need to relink or install native VWS Support.

     Features

     o  Emulates most UIS routines by using X11 (Does not emulate
        DOP's, common video QIO interfaces, or tablets).

     o  Emulates UIS virtual color maps by using X11 routines.

     o  Supports all of the UIS writing modes.

     o  The standard UIS patterns are built into VMS/UISX.

     o  Provides the standard UIS fonts in DECwindows format.

     UIS to DDIF Converter, Version 2.0-This tool allows the conver-
     sion of .UIS files, created by Hardcopy UIS (this includes SIGHT
     files) into any output format supported by the CDA Converter
     Library.

     DECwindows X11 Server, Version 2.0-Enables the user running VWS
     to create a VWS window that is an entire monochrome DECwindows
     environment. The user can then cycle between this window and
     other VWS windows offering the ability to run applications in
     both environments without rebooting.

     UIS Source Code Annotator, Version 2.0-The UIS Source Code An-
     notator helps you migrate UIS applications to DECwindows. It
     gives you information you can use in porting your UIS applica-
     tions to DECwindows. By running a UIS application through the
     Annotator, you can learn which UIS routines have equivalent Xlib
     routines and what those routines are. You also can learn which
     UIS routines have no equivalent Xlib routines. You should use
     the Annotator along with A Guide to Migrating VWS Applications
     to DECwindows.

     A Guide to Migrating VWS Applications to DECwindows, Version 2.0
     - This document provides information to aid software developers
     and architects in migrating existing UIS applications to the
     DECwindows platform by pointing out the differences between the

                                     3

 






     two platforms and by providing programming examples in a ported
     application written specifically for this purpose.
