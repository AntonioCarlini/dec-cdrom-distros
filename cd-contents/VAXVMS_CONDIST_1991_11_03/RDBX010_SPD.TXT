     PRODUCT NAME:  DEC RdbExpert for VMS, Version 1.0   SPD 31.72.00

     DESCRIPTION

     DEC RdbExpert is a DECwindows and command-line-based expert
     system database tuning tool that is designed to reduce the
     time and effort required to produce tuned VAX Rdb/VMS physical
     database storage designs. DEC RdbExpert is intended to help
     database designers and administrators during the initial design
     and subsequent maintenance phases of database development.
     DEC RdbExpert should expand the tuning capabilities of less
     experienced database administrators while improving overall DBA
     tuning productivity.

     DEC RdbExpert gathers information of importance encompassing
     logical level input related to physical design. DEC RdbExpert
     bases its design recommendations on this logical schema infor-
     mation, as well as the system environment, database record vol-
     umes, and transaction workload information. DEC RdbExpert makes
     extensive use of import functions which enables users to quickly
     provide the required data. For example, DEC RdbExpert can im-
     port DECtrace transaction workload data captured directly from
     running VAX Rdb/VMS databases for use in the design process,
     thus creating designs based upon the actual workload executing
     against existing databases. The DBA then reviews this input and
     modifies it where necessary to ensure that it is an accurate
     reflection of the actual run-time requirements.

     DEC RdbExpert generates storage designs in the form of the SQL
     Data Definition Language statements for VAX Rdb/VMS. It also
     generates executable storage design creation procedures as well
     as the VAX Rdb/VMS RMU/LOAD and UNLOAD scripts used to unload
     existing data and reload it into the redesigned database. In

     addition, DEC RdbExpert generates design reports to educate the
     DBA about the design process and the database tuning rules.

     The DEC RdbExpert knowledge base is cognizant of the VAX Rdb/VMS
     database system internals, tuning rules, and run-time optimizer
     heuristics. DEC RdbExpert uses this knowledge to help the DBA
     arrive at the performance tuned design.

     Features

     DEC RdbExpert provides a DECwindows interface, taking advantage
     of the advanced user interface capabilities of that environ-
     ment. DEC RdbExpert also provides a full-function, command-line
     interface for non-DECwindows environments.

     Using DEC RdbExpert, a database designer/administrator can:

     o  Import VAX Rdb/VMS database schemas into the DEC RdbExpert
        design repository

     o  Enter the database transaction workload information by one or
        more of the following methods:

        -  Using workload information captured by DECtrace

        -  Through a text file containing the VAX SQL like Physical
           Design Language (PDL) created by the DBA

        -  Through SQL MODULE language files

        -  Through the DECwindows interface

     o  View and edit the workload data modifying or entering cycle,
        frequency, and importance information for the various work-
        load elements of the database applications, that is, appli-
        cations, programs, and transactions with their accompanying
        data manipulation language (DML) requests

     o  Enter the database volume and occurrence information by one
        or more of the following methods:

        -  From the VAX Rdb/VMS root file and tables

        -  Through a text file containing the volume information
           created by the DBA

        -  Through the DECwindows interface

     o  Apply volatility ratings - how frequently the data is added,
        modified, or deleted, to the schema at both the relation
        (record) and column (field) levels

     o  Define system environment for the target database

     o  Catalog multiple logical designs, each with one or more
        physical designs associated with it

     o  Generate the design reports that identify the input assump-
        tions and design information for the recommended parameters
        and database design as well as educate the user regarding the
        design rules and choices

     o  Create VAX Rdb/VMS physical designs consisting of SQL physi-
        cal DDL, and creation and run-time parameters, as well as the
        .COM procedure to execute these designs

     o  Create RMU/UNLOAD - LOAD scripts to unload and load the VAX
        Rdb/VMS data into the redesigned databases
