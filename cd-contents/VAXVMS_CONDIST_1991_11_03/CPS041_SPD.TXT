           PRODUCT NAME:  DECprint Printing Services     SPD 32.41.03
                          for VMS, Version 4.1 

          DESCRIPTION

           DECprint Printing Services for VMS is a layered product re-
           quired by suitably configured VMS systems to access 
           PostScript[R][1] based print devices. (See the SOFTWARE WARRANTY 
           section for non-Digital PostScript device exclusions.)

           DECprint Printing Services software consists of the follow-
           ing components:

           o  A print symbiont that processes print requests from the
              host on which it resides.

           o  Communication software to transmit the request and as-
              sociated data over the Ethernet to a remote PrintServer
              printer via DECnet.

           o  Translators to convert ANSI Text and Sixel Graphics, ReGIS,
              HP[R] PCL level IV, Tektronix[R] 4010/4014, and DDIF Bitonal
              Image files into the PostScript language.

           o  A collection of optional ALL-IN-1 Scripts and a WPS-PLUS
              Printer Table file that enhances compatibility between
              ALL-IN-1, WPS-PLUS, and Digital PostScript printers. ALL-IN-1
              /WPS-PLUS users can access the many unique features of
              these printers, such as duplex printing on the PrintServer
              20. PrintServer printer performance is greatly improved
              for ALL-IN-1 multiple selection and print operations. Sup-
              port for LN03 font cartridge emulation is also included.

           DECprint Printing Services for VMS,         SPD 32.41.03
           Version 4.1

           o  A series of PostScript tools for creator software sup-
              port. These include a PostScript error handler and Font
              Encoding Vectors for the ISO Latin Alphabet Number 1 (ISO
              8859/1) and Digital Multinational Character Set for all
              of the built-in PostScript fonts except the Symbol font.

           DECprint Printing Services software must be installed on each
           system that provides print services to its users of PostScript
           printers.

           LN03 Image Printers are direct-connected to specific work-
           station configurations only. Refer to the LN03 Image Sup-
           port Software Software Product Description (SPD 31.52.xx)
           for LN03 Image Printer requirements.

           A system running DECprint Printing Services software can trans-
           mit print requests to any PrintServer printer on the net-
           work that is defined in its network database. A system run-
           ning DECprint Printing Services software can transmit print
           requests to any desktop PostScript printer in the local area
           network that is connected to a LAT based terminal server.

           Note: VAX PrintServer Supporting Host Software (SPD 27.68.xx)
           is a companion product to this software for PrintServer de-
           vice operation.

           Features

           Print Symbiont

           All VMS systems require the installation of this software
           product to process print requests to the supported print-
           ers.

           The /PARAMETERS qualifier in the PRINT command passes printer
           specific parameters to the print symbiont for processing.
           Not all parameters are supported on all print devices. These
           parameters are as follows:

           Version 4.1

           o  Data_Type - Specifies the type of data in the print job.
              If necessary, the print symbiont uses a translator to con-
              vert the data to PostScript data syntax.

           o  Messages - Specifies the disposition of messages gener-
              ated by the print job as either saved in a log file or
              printed at the end of the job.

           o  Layup_Definition - Specifies the name of a file that con-
              tains all of the page layup features (Borders, Margins,
              Margin Alternation, Pages Per Sheet, First Page, Page Or-
              der and Page Grid) except Number_Up.

           o  Number_Up - Specifies the maximum number of pages that
              should be printed on a sheet.

           o  Page_Limit - Specifies the first and last pages of the
              job to be printed.

           o  Page_Orientation - Specifies the orientation of printed
              output on the page (portrait or landscape).

           o  Page_Size - Specifies the size of the logical pages be-
              ing printed.

           o  Sheet_Size - Specifies the physical size of the sheets
              to be printed.

           o  Sheet_Count - Specifies the number of times each sheet
              is to be printed (uncollated copies only).

           o  Input_Tray - Specifies the printer input tray that will
              supply the paper or medium for this job.

           o  Output_Tray - Specifies the printer output tray where the
              printed output will be deposited.

           o  Sides - Specifies whether the layout of a page is sim-
              plex, duplex or tumble.

           o  Fonts_Used - Specifies the soft font module(s) to be loaded
              before the LN03 ANSI file containing font selection com-
              mands is submitted to the ANSI Translator.

           Version 4.1

           o  Tab - Specifies emulation of the LN03 Set Terminal/Tab
              command.

           The /SETUP qualifier may be used to send specified modules
           from a device control library to the printer. These modules
           may be encoded in ANSI, PCL, or PostScript.

           The print symbiont also supplies accounting information for
           each print job as follows: sheets of paper printed, the num-
           ber of RMS Gets, and the number of QIO Writes.

           LN03 Emulation Features

           LN03 Emulation applies only to printing ANSI files and has
           two major components:

           1. LN03 Font Cartridge Emulation is intended to emulate font
              cartridges on the LN03 printer. The file must contain font
              selection commands, and the FONTS_USED parameter spec-
              ifies the soft font module(s) to be loaded into the printer
              in order to print the file.

           2. PRTSMB Emulation provides further LN03 printer emulation.
              These functions emulate VMS PRTSMB, including the fol-
              lowing:

              o  Margins, as specified by DEFINE/FORM/MARGIN

              o  Page setup, as specified by DEFINE/FORM/PAGE_SETUP

              o  Wrap and truncate, as specified by options to DEFINE
                 /FORM

              o  Page headers, as specified by PRINT/HEADER

              o  Double spacing, as specified by PRINT/SPACE

           Translators

           DECprint Printing Services for VMS,         SPD 32.41.03
           Version 4.1

           Translator software allows users to print documents with graphic
           protocols other than the native language of the printer by
           translating the designated protocol into PostScript. The trans-
           lators are invoked by the print symbiont at print time through
           the /PARAMETERS switch of the PRINT command or by submis-
           sion to a translator-specific queue.

           The translators provided convert the following data types
           into PostScript:

           o  ANSI

           o  ReGIS

           o  Tektronix 4010/4014

           o  DDIF (Bitonal Image subset only)

           o  HP PCL Level IV

           ANSI text and Sixel graphics are compatible with the LN03.
           Documents containing LN03 font cartridge commands will be
           properly translated if the system also has the appropriate
           optional LN03 Soft Font kit installed, and the appropriate
           Fonts_Used parameter is provided, or by submitting to a queue
           associated with that parameter.

           Note: The ScriptPrinter and DEClaser printers contain less
           PostScript virtual memory than the PrintServer printers. Files
           utilizing LN03 downline loadable font storage may experi-
           ence differences in output between a PrintServer printer,
           the ScriptPrinter printer, and the DEClaser printer.

           PostScript Tools

           PostScript tools consist of the following:

           o  A PostScript error handler which prints the last partial
              page of output as well as information to help identify
              the error. This information includes the error name, the
              PostScript operator that encountered the error, the operand

              stack, and the graphics state of the machine at the time
              of the error.

           o  Font Encoding vectors for the ISO Latin Alphabet Number
              1 (ISO 8859/1) and Digital Multinational Character Set
              are provided for all of the built-in fonts.
