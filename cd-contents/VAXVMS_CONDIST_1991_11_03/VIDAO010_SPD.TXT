          PRODUCT NAME:  DEC RdbAccess for ORACLE on VMS, Version
          1.0                                                 SPD 32.80.00

          DESCRIPTION

          DEC RdbAccess is a family of database interoperability prod-
          ucts which provide direct, transparent access from VAX Rdb/VMS
          applications to non-VAX Rdb/VMS databases and files. DEC RdbAc-
          cess servers are specialized VAX Rdb/VMS run-time systems which
          can be accessed by most applications and tools which work with
          VAX Rdb/VMS. DEC RdbAccess for ORACLE[R] on VMS (referred to as
          RdbAccess for ORACLE) provides direct, transparent, read-only
          access to ORACLE databases residing on VAX/VMS systems from
          applications developed using products such as VAX RALLY, VAX
          DATATRIEVE, VAX TEAMDATA, and DECdecision.

          RdbAccess for ORACLE also supports access from the VAX Rdb/VMS
          interactive utilities, SQL and RDO, from precompiled 3GL appli-
          cations with embedded SQL or RDML, and from desktop applications
          using SQL/Services. VAX Data Distributor can be used to ex-
          tract data from ORACLE and replicate the information across the
          network in VAX Rdb/VMS.

          RdbAccess for ORACLE runs under VMS on VAX, MicroVAX, VAXserver,
          and VAXstation systems.

          Features

          o  RdbAccess for ORACLE provides direct database access to VMS-
             based ORACLE tables and views. The user application accesses
             ORACLE data the same way it would access Rdb/VMS data. Data
             retrieved from ORACLE can be displayed at a user's terminal,
             printed, or copied to another database or file.

          DEC RdbAccess for ORACLE on VMS, Version 1.0        SPD 32.80.00



          o  RdbAccess for ORACLE does not require users to create a copy
             of the ORACLE database in order to make the data available to
             VAX Rdb/VMS applications. Creating VAX Rdb/VMS extracts of
             ORACLE data is a matter of user preference and convenience.

          o  RdbAccess for ORACLE is a specialized VAX Rdb/VMS run-time
             system. All requests for ORACLE data are processed by the VAX
             Rdb/VMS run-time system. A user or programmer makes requests
             to ORACLE using exactly the same commands as would be used to
             access VAX Rdb/VMS.

          o  RdbAccess for ORACLE supports most of the same user inter-
             faces that can be used with VAX Rdb/VMS.

          o  ORACLE data can be accessed directly from precompiled 3GL
             programs using embedded SQL, SQL module language, dynamic
             SQL, callable RDO, or RDML. These data access sublanguages
             are the same sublanguages used to access VAX Rdb/VMS data
             tables and views. Reference VAX Rdb/VMS (SPD 25.59.xx) for a
             complete description of programming language support.

          o  ORACLE data can be accessed interactively using the VAX
             Rdb/VMS interactive utilities, SQL and RDO.

          o  ORACLE data can be accessed through SQL/-Services directly
             from desktop applications running on MS-DOS[R], OS/2[TM],
             Macintosh[TM], ULTRIX or VMS. Reference VAX Rdb/VMS (SPD
             25.59.xx) for a complete description of SQL/Services.

          o  ORACLE data can be extracted and stored in Rdb/VMS tables us-
             ing VAX Data Distributor. Data from multiple ORACLE databases
             can be rolled up into a single Rdb/VMS table.

          o  When RdbAccess for ORACLE is used with VAX DATATRIEVE, users
             can generate DATATRIEVE queries and reports that include data
             from both ORACLE tables or views and Rdb/VMS tables or views.

          o  When RdbAccess for ORACLE is used with DECdecision or VAX
             TEAMDATA, end users can access ORACLE data tables and views
             directly, join them with Rdb/VMS tables, store the results
             in folders, download the data to a PC-based spreadsheet,

                                          2

 


          DEC RdbAccess for ORACLE on VMS, Version 1.0        SPD 32.80.00



             etc., for use in decision support and other personal and
             departmental applications.

          o  VAX RALLY can use RdbAccess for ORACLE to retrieve informa-
             tion directly from ORACLE at application execution time.

          o  When a user attaches to the ORACLE database, RdbAccess for
             ORACLE retrieves metadata from the ORACLE catalog and con-
             verts the definitions into Digital relational data defi-
             nitions. These definitions can be integrated into CDD/Plus
             using the RDO or SQL INTEGRATE commands. 3GL programs can be
             compiled against data definitions in CDD/Plus.

          o  When a request is made for ORACLE data, the VAX Rdb/VMS
             runtime system passes the request to RdbAccess for ORACLE.
             RdbAccess for ORACLE converts the request into ORACLE SQL
             and submits it to ORACLE using dynamic SQL. RdbAccess for
             ORACLE performs any necessary data translations and returns
             the results to the calling program.

          o  RdbAccess for ORACLE supports remote access to ORACLE data
             using either VAX Rdb/VMS remote data access capabilities or
             ORACLE remote data access capabilities. RdbAccess for OR-
             ACLE must be installed on the same node as an ORACLE DBMS
             instance. Applications on a remote node can access ORACLE
             provided that the remote node is running VAX Rdb/VMS. Rd-
             bAccess for ORACLE can direct a request to a remote ORACLE
             database using ORACLE's SQL*Net[R].

          o  RdbAccess provides a logging facility that can trace communi-
             cations activity, log errors, and help isolate problems.

          Limitations

          RdbAccess for ORACLE provides read-only access to ORACLE
          databases running on VAX systems.

          HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

          VAX, MicroVAX, VAXstation, or VAXserver configuration as speci-
          fied in the System Support Addendum (SSA 32.80.00-x).

             *  NOTE. At least one VAX Rdb/VMS full development license
                must be installed on the network, although VAX Rdb/VMS
                does not need to be installed on the same node as RdbAc-
                cess for ORACLE. RdbAccess for ORACLE must be installed
                on the same node as an ORACLE DBMS instance. To access
                ORACLE data from nodes in a network other than a node
                on which RdbAccess is installed, either VAX Rdb/VMS De-
                velopment Option, VAX Rdb/VMS Interactive Option, or VAX
                Rdb/VMS Run-Time Only Option software must be installed on
                the node from which the user initiates the access. Refer-
                ence VAX Rdb/VMS (SPD 25.59.xx) for more information on
                runtime, interactive, and full development options.

          Other Software

          RdbAccess for ORACLE does not include a user interface. Refer to
          the Optional Software section for choices.
