     PRODUCT NAME:  DECvoice Software, Version 2.0       SPD 29.97.02

     DESCRIPTION

     The DECvoice Software provides a programming interface to the
     DECvoice hardware (DTCO4 and DTCN5/DTCO5 options). The DECvoice
     hardware and software has been designed to allow access to the
     North American telephone network by voice applications on a VAX
     platform.

     DECvoice Software supports the following functionality:

     o  Answers telephone calls

     o  Originates telephone calls

     o  Generates hook-flash signaling that can be used to control
        certain PBX features such as call-transfer capability

     o  Detects and generates DTMF tones (Touch-Tone)

     o  Records and plays digitized messages in a variety of stan-
        dardized formats

     o  Synthesizes messages from ASCII text

     o  Performs speaker-independent voice recognition of a prede-
        fined vocabulary

     o  Performs speaker-dependent voice recognition of a user-
        defined vocabulary

     The telephone network interface can be either analog (tip-ring,
     RJ11) using the DTCO4 option or digital (T1, RJ45) using the
     DTCN5/DTCO5 options. Refer to the System Support Addendum (SSA
     29.97.02-x) for details of the network interface requirements.

     The text-to-speech synthesis subsystem is comparable to the
     DECtalk family of speech synthesizers. Name pronunciation soft-
     ware enhances the pronunciation accuracy of surnames and place-
     names. A user defined dictionary capability is also provided for
     alternate pronunciation of synthesized text.

     The digitized speech subsystem supports encoding at 64 Kilobits
     per second (Kbps) u-Law, 64 Kbps A-Law, 32 Kbps ADPCM, 24 Kbps
     ADPCM, and 16 Kbps subband.

     The isolated word recognition software, licensed as part of
     the base kit, and the continuous word recognition software, li-
     censed separately, are optimized for native speakers of American
     English. Both the isolated word recognition subsystem voice
     recognition standard templates and the optional continuous
     word recognition subsystem voice recognition templates con-
     tain speaker-independent recognition support for the digits
     zero through nine, and the words "yes," "no," and, as used as a
     substitute for zero, "oh."

     Tools are provided to allow the creation of site and application
     specific isolated word speaker-dependent templates.

     DECvoice Software provides users with the capability to monitor
     the progress of calls that it originates. Application software
     can determine if dial tone, busy signal, ringing, or call pickup
     has occurred.

     SOURCE CODE INFORMATION

     The following DECvoice source code modules are provided on
     magnetic distribution media:
