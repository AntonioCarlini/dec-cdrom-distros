     PRODUCT NAME:  DEC VUIT[TM] (Visual User Interface Tool),    SPD
     32.09.00
                    Version 1.0 for VMS Systems

     DESCRIPTION

     DEC VUIT is an interactive WYSIWYG-style (What-You-See-Is-What-
     You-Get) editor for building Motif[R] application interfaces. It
     is intended for developers experienced in constructing inter-
     faces using Motif or similar windowing systems.

     DEC VUIT provides a direct manipulation interface to the
     OSF/Motif[R] Release 1.1 User Interface Language (UIL). DEC
     VUIT also provides an environment that supports rapid devel-
     opment of graphical user interfaces that are compliant with
     OSF/Motif. Prototype interfaces can be tested, quickly modified
     based on end-user input, and fed directly into the development
     stream. Since DEC VUIT generates industry-standard OSF/Motif
     UIL, not a proprietary presentation description language, the
     interface built using DEC VUIT is portable to any other platform
     that supports the OSF/Motif environment.

     DEC VUIT enables developers to build the interface visually
     instead of writing code. During editing, it uses inherent knowl-
     edge of widget properties and parent-child relationships to
     reduce runtime errors.

     DEC VUIT[TM] (Visual User Interface Tool),         SPD 32.09.00
     Version 1.0 for VMS Systems


     Features

     o  Based on industry standards: OSF/Motif Release 1.1 UIL and
        X11[TM]/R4 intrinsics; not a proprietary presentation de-
        scription language.

     o  Runs on multiple platforms: VMS and ULTRIX on VAX, and ULTRIX
        on RISC. UIL generated by DEC VUIT can run on any vendor
        platform that supports Motif, allowing the developer to have
        Digital Equipment Corporation hardware as the development
        platform with multiple targets.

     o  Widget Tree Browser presents the widget hierarchy of the
        interface under construction, allowing the developer to
        navigate and access specific portions of the interface for
        editing purposes.

     o  Uses real widgets, not graphical representations, allowing
        developers to see the actual runtime appearance while cre-
        ating or editing interfaces. Developers are constrained to
        legal widget resources.

     o  Offers the advantages of UIL-based interface design:

        -  Provides support for resource lists, named values, and
           runtime variables (identifiers).

        -  Enforces legal parent-child relationships to avoid runtime
           errors.

        -  Allows developers to build the interface and the applica-
           tion separately, without relinking after every change.

        -  Allows developers to design interfaces that incorporate
           their own user-defined widgets.

     o  Contains editors for all data types supported by the Motif
        toolkit, including color, font, and icon.

     o  Contains comprehensive, context-sensitive on-line help. This
        is the major source of reference information on the product.
