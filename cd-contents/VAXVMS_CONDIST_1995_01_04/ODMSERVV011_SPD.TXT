           PRODUCT NAME:  OpenDATA Manager, Version 1.1                    SPD
           51.12.01

           DESCRIPTION

           The OpenDATA Manager software product is a component of Digital 
Equip-
           ment Corporation's product data and document management strategy, de-
           signed to manage product information throughout the product life cy-
           cle at the department and enterprise levels of an organization. Open-
           DATA Manager provides data sharing across multiple work groups and 
across
           multiple disciplines within an organization. OpenDATA Manager manages
           files, documents, product data structures, versions, revisions, con-
           figuration information, and associated descriptive data relating to
           the information being managed. OpenDATA Manager tracks, stores, and
           controls this information using formal data management procedures for
           security to create, access, and modify the information.

           FEATURES

           OpenDATA Manager offers the following features:

           Data Modeling

           OpenDATA Manager provides a methodology for representing the logical
           model that describes the product data, documents, and files that are
           generated during the product life cycle. This logical representation
           is a data model that allows the user to define objects, attributes,
           and relationships that represent the product data and documents.

           For example, a simple office data model could consist of user-defined
           objects such as cabinets, folders, and files. A more complex product
           development data model might consist of user-defined objects such as
           project, product, assembly, part, documents, drawings, engineering 
notes,
           specification, and files.

                                                                   AE-Q1FTB-TE

 



           OpenDATA Manager, Version 1.1                          SPD 51.12.01


           The attributes for each object type can represent information crit-
           ical to the product, such as status, part number, revision number, 
owner
           name, plant location, quantity, or effectivity date.

           Object relationships allow objects to be connected together. 
Relation-
           ships can be used to build a hierarchy of objects, which can show de-
           pendencies, derivations, and collections for use in product structure
           or bill of material applications. This object hierarchy enables the
           creation of specific configurations of product information, for ex-
           ample, as-designed, as-built, or as-supported.

           Configuration Management

           OpenDATA Manager provides the ability to create a version of an ob-
           ject, where a version represents a state of an object at any point in
           time. Once a set of objects is configured together using object re-
           lationships, then this configuration can also be versioned to estab-
           lish a baseline revision.

           The ability to create and manage versions and revisions allows for 
dif-
           ferences to be tracked so changes over time can be determined and 
man-
           aged.

           File Management

           OpenDATA Manager provides controlled access to the product data, 
draw-
           ings, and documents by managing the files generated by the tools and
           applications used during the product life cycle.

           OpenDATA Manager provides a project vault, which is the collection of
           files being managed by the server in a secure storage area, and a 
work-
           in-process area, which is the collection of files that are in the lo-
           cal client environment.

           OpenDATA Manager provides file operations to reserve (request that a
           file from the vault be checked out and copied to the work-in-process
           area), replace (request that a work-in-process file that was previ-
           ously reserved be checked back into the vault), and fetch (request 
that
           a read-only copy of a vault file be copied to the work-in-process 
area).

           OpenDATA Manager, Version 1.1                          SPD 51.12.01


           OpenDATA Manager provides the ability to create users with OpenDATA
           Manager usernames and passwords, thus providing user authentication
           within the environment. As users are created, they can be placed into
           groups that identify the extent to which a user can access objects,
           activities, and functions.

           OpenDATA Manager data security features offer the ability to define
           object-level protection such as read, write, delete, relate, admin-
           istration, and reserve/replace for various classes of users, such as
           superuser, user, group, or world. The ability to define Access Con-
           trol Lists (ACLs) is also included.

           The combination of user authentication and object-level protection 
en-
           ables a controlled, secured environment.

           Notification

           OpenDATA Manager provides the ability for team members to communicate
           via electronic mail, allowing users to define distribution lists; to
           select, read, delete, and send messages; and to create and delete 
mail
           folders.

           OpenDATA Manager provides the ability for users to assign distribu-
           tion lists to objects, so when a pre-defined event occurs to the ob-
           ject then the users on the distribution list can be notified. The no-
           tify events include create (an object is created); replace (a file is
           replaced); set (an object's attributes were modified); checkpoint (an
           object was checkpointed); review (an object has entered a review pro-
           cess); end review (an object has completed a review process); insert
           (an object has been related to other objects); and remove (an object
           has been unrelated from other objects).

           OpenDATA Manager can also attach a message to an object. For example,
           when a user is reading a message that includes an attached object, 
the
           user can immediately locate the object in the environment based on 
the
           message.

           With OpenDATA Manager, users can place an object or group of objects
           into a review and approval process. When the object is in review, a
           review team (consisting of a list of reviewers and a review team 
leader)
           is requested to vote on the status of the object under review.

           The review process is a defined sequence of steps consisting of re-
           view teams that can be reviewing the object sequentially (as one team
           completes, the next team starts) or in parallel (multiple teams re-
           view the object at the same time).

           The review process is monitored by OpenDATA Manager. As actions need
           to occur, notification messages are sent to review team members to 
start
           a review, to remind them if they are late in voting based on a time
           limit set by the review leader, and to review leaders when a review
           is completed. The messages can contain comments from the team members
           explaining why and how they voted.

           Archive and Restore

           OpenDATA Manager provides the ability to archive object information
           and the associated files from the vault to the archive area. The se-
           lection of objects is based on configuration information.

           If required, OpenDATA Manager also provides the ability to restore 
in-
           formation that was previously archived from the archive area back 
into
           the vault.

           History

           OpenDATA Manager provides an audit trail by logging user actions to
           the database. This allows the system administrator to access the 
database
           and to query the history information to track user actions such as 
how
           many objects a user has created, or to understand how the environment
           is being used and by whom.

           Distributed Client/Server Configuration

           OpenDATA Manager software components run on client and server 
machines
           that communicate through Digital's ObjectBroker (formerly known as 
DEC
           ACA Services). This configuration provides for a distributed and 
scal-
           able environment for enterprise-wide integration of applications.

           OpenDATA Manager, Version 1.1                          SPD 51.12.01


           OpenDATA Manager includes, window-based, graphical client 
applications
           for the users to invoke the OpenDATA Manager operations and a second
           application for the MS Windows environment, the Data Model Editor, to
           establish the data models that represents the data, objects, users,
           documents, and files that need to be managed.

           The server software components include the data management server, 
which
           provides the metadata operations and controls access to the OpenDATA
           Manager database; the event server, which provides the distribution
           of notification messages based on events in the environment; the his-
           tory server, which logs the audit trail to the database, the storage
           area, where the managed files are stored, and the database, which is
           the repository for information tracked by OpenDATA Manager.

           Customization

           OpenDATA Manager environments can be customized by using,

           o  the Data Model Editor to create a customer-specific data model 
with
              customer-defined objects, attributes, and relationships.

           o  the method refinement capabilities to modify the behavior of the
              data management server.

           o  the client development environment which provides an application
              programming interface to develop customer-specific applications.

           INSTALLATION

           Digital recommends that the customer's initial installation of this
           software be performed by Digital Software Services. These services 
pro-
           vide for installation of the software product by an experienced Dig-
           ital Software Specialist.
