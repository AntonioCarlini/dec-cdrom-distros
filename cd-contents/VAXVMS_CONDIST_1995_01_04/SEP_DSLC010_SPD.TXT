 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC Distributed Server Library for OpenVMS, Version 1.0
 SPD 39.64.00

 DESCRIPTION

 The DEC Distributed Server Library (DSL) is a set of tools to build
 client applications and application-specific servers in heterogeneous
 operating environments. DSL functions within a client/server archi-
 tecture.

 The DSL has the following components:

 o  DEC Distributed Server Library Server for OpenVMS[*]

 o  DEC Distributed Server Library Client for OpenVMS

 o  DEC Distributed Server Library Client for Windows[TM]

 Features

 DSL features are described according to the following:

 o  DSL Client/Server Architecture

 o  Tools to Build Clients and Servers

 o  Development Environment

 o  Documentation

 o  Sample Application

 ____________________

 The   terms OpenVMS and VMS refer to the OpenVMS Operating System.

 DSL Client/Server Architecture

 Applications use the DEC Distributed Server Library within a client
 /server architecture. Client processes (on separate, remote machines)
 send requests to a server process. The server process performs each
 request and may send back a reply to the client.

 DSL supports a large number of simultaneous client processes, limited
 only by the number of logical connections allowed by DECnet. Further-
 more, all communications are asynchronous, so each client process can
 issue concurrent requests to many remote servers.

 There is one server to handle incoming client requests that has a built-
 in multiplexer for managing a set of subprocesses. Each subprocess is
 a request handler. When a new request arrives, the server passes the
 request to one of the request handlers, which may send a reply to the
 client. The number of handler subprocesses is variable and can be tuned
 to maximize server performance.

 Tools to Build Clients and Servers

 DSL provides the following:

 o  A network communications interface for clients to exchange requests
    and replies with a server

 o  A multiplexer to optimize server transaction rates

 o  Libraries for:

    -  Writing a client application that uses synchronous or asynchronous
       routines to establish and terminate connections, send requests,
       and process replies

    -  Writing a single process or multiprocess server

 o  Database independence
    DSL applications can use any database or programming language that
    conforms to the VAX or the MIT C[TM] calling standard

                                  2

 

 Development Environment

 DSL provides an application programming interface (API) and support
 libraries. The interface allows programmers to write DSL client and
 server programs without requiring knowledge of network communications.

 Supports Use of Native Windowing Systems:

 DSL is compatible with DECwindows and Motif(R) on OpenVMS and Microsoft(R)
 Windows on MS-DOS(R).

 Nonblocking Execution:

 DSL clients support nonblocking programs. In event-driven processing
 environments, such as Microsoft Windows, programs may be structured
 to include an event-dispatching mechanism and a collection of proce-
 dures. These procedures are invoked by the dispatching mechanism when
 an event occurs.

 DSL client services allow an application to release control to the event-
 dispatching mechanism without waiting for a response from the DSL server.
 This is particularly important in cases where network delays exist or
 a large amount of processing is being performed by the DSL server.

 Windows, Memory Models, and Modes:

 DSL requires Microsoft Windows running in enhanced mode. DSL supports
 small, medium, large, and huge memory models.

 Documentation

 The DSL documentation set includes the following manuals:

 o  Programmer's Reference Manual
    This manual describes how to develop and test client programs that
    use DSL servers. It includes detailed information on DSL components
    and functions, design and development guidelines, system manage-
    ment and interface reference information.

 o  Installation Guide for OpenVMS
    This guide describes how to install the DSL Client and the DSL Server
    process on OpenVMS, and explains how to run the Installation Ver-
    ification Procedure (IVP).

 o  Installation Guide for Windows
    This guide describes how to install the DSL Client software on a
    PC-based system running MS-DOS.

 Release Notes are available on-line as part of the media package. The
 Release Notes contain information specific to each release of DSL and
 information added after the production date for the DEC Distributed
 Server Library's documentation set.

 Sample Application

 A complete sample application is provided, including client programs
 and DSL server code. The sample application includes all necessary prod-
 uct executable images as well as source code modules. Inclusion of the
 source code allows the customer to use the sample program as a tem-
 plate for developing custom client programs.

 INSTALLATION

 Only experienced customers should attempt installation of this prod-
 uct. Digital recommends that all customers purchase Digital's Instal-
 lation Service. This service provides for installation of the soft-
 ware by an experienced Digital software specialist.

 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

 DSL requires the following hardware for its components:

 o  DSL Client for OpenVMS and DSL Server for OpenVMS:
    The DSL Client and Server software for OpenVMS runs on the follow-
    ing VAX processors: VAX 3xxx, VAX 4xxx, VAX 6xxx, VAX 7xxx, VAX 8xxx,
    and VAX 9xxx. Refer to the complete list of supported processor and
    /or hardware configurations as specified in the System Support Ad-
    dendum (SSA 39.64.00-x).

 o  DSL Client for Windows:
    The DSL Client for Windows will run on one hundred percent IBM[TM]-
    compatible Intel[TM] PC systems as specified in the System Support
    Addendum (SSA 39.64.00-x).
