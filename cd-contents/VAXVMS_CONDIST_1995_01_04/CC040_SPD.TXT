 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC C Version 4.0                       SPD 25.38.19
                for OpenVMS VAX Systems

 DESCRIPTION

 DEC  C  is an ANSI-compliant  implementation  of  the  C  programming
 language with Digital extensions.  The DEC C  compiler runs under the
 OpenVMS  VAX  Operating  System and generates optimized and position-
 independent code.

 DEC C is a native-mode VAX language product, and is  integrated  into
 the  OpenVMS VAX Common Language Environment.  All OpenVMS VAX system
 services are  available to programs written in DEC C.  DEC C programs
 can invoke, as functions, modules written in other VAX languages.

 DEC  C  supports   OpenVMS  VAX  Record  Management  Services  (RMS),
 including sequential, relative, and  indexed  file  organizations and
 associated access methods.  DEC  C  also  supports stream file-access
 methods common among many C implementations.

 DEC C provides extensive ANSI C  conformance  checking,  and supports
 the lint-like features of the DEC Source  Code  Analyzer.    The  DEC
 Source  Code Analyzer allows the programmer to check  for  consistent
 function  usage  throughout  a  program  environment.    DEC  C  also
 generates  complete  debug and traceback records for use with OpenVMS
 Debug.  Debug allows the C programmer to set breakpoints, examine and
 modify the  contents  of  user  variables,  and  selectively  halt or
 continue program execution.

 Features

 o  Separate modes of compilation to support each of four C dialects:

    -  A strict ANSI mode which compiles according to the ANSI standard

                                                         AE-M878U-TE

 

    -  A relaxed ANSI  mode  which  compiles  according  to  the  ANSI
       standard but accepts additional Digital extensions

    -  A VAX C mode which supports VAX C extensions

    -  A  common  mode  which  supports  many  common  usage  C  (pcc)
       extensions

 o  Data types for numeric, nonnumeric, and systems programming:

    -  Byte, word, longword, signed and unsigned integers

    -  Single and double-precision floating point numbers.  D-float or
       G-float may be used in double-precision format

    -  Ability  to  pass numeric constants by  reference  in  function
       calls

 o  Storage allocation using:

    -  Keywords  (globalref,  globaldef,  and globalvalue) for sharing
       data among program modules

    -  Keywords  (readonly, noshare, and psect name specification) for
       control of data attributes and data placement

    -  Keyword  (_align)  for  specifying  the alignment boundaries of
       data objects

    -  Pragmas to control extern models and structure member alignment

 o  Option for running only the preprocessor phase of compilation

 o  Pragmas to control compiler options

 o  Separate and combined compilation capabilities

 o  Compiler generated listing file including optional:

    -  Machine code

    -  Macro expansion

    -  Compilation statistics

                                  2

 

 o  Built-in functions  allow  access  to  a  subset  of  VAX  machine
    instructions

 o  Integration into the OpenVMS VAX Common Language Environment:

    -  Generation of complete  debug and traceback records for OpenVMS
       VAX Debug support

    -  Conforms to the OpenVMS VAX Calling Standard

    -  Access  to the Common  Run-Time  Library  for  general  purpose
       routines and support of multi-language environments

    -  Access to the data management  facilities of OpenVMS VAX Record
       Management  Services  (RMS)  via  direct calls  to  the  Common
       Run-Time Library

    -  Support    for    providing  error  diagnostics  to  the    DEC
       Language-Sensitive  Editor  and cross reference information for
       the DEC Source Code Analyzer component

 o  Extensive global  and  local  optimizations  of generated code for
    increased performance under OpenVMS

 o  Extensive control over optimization behavior

 o  Interface to the curses screen manipulation package

 o  Installation kit cooperates  with  DEC C++ for OpenVMS VAX Systems
    product

 Compatibility with Other C Implementations

 DEC C  is a conforming  hosted  implementation  of  ANSI  X3.159-1989
 Programming Language C (ISO 9899:1990[1992]).  It can operate in four
 different   modes:    strict  ANSI  compatibility,    relaxed    ANSI
 compatibility  (ANSI  plus  Digital extensions), VAX C  compatibility
 mode, and common C (pcc) compatibility mode.   The VAX C and common C
 modes provide many features to ease porting from other environments.

 While  many  programs  written  in  C  for  other  compilers  can  be
 successfully recompiled  under  DEC  C,  some incompatibilities among
 implementations exist.


                                  3

 

 Over 275 UNIX[R]-compatible  routines have been included in the DEC C
 Run-Time Library.  Routines  selected  for  inclusion in this library
 are primarily those for which  a  reasonable  emulation  is  possible
 under OpenVMS VAX.  Inherent architectural  differences  between UNIX
 and  OpenVMS  VAX  necessarily  preclude the likelihood  of  every  C
 program  written  for  a  UNIX  environment  compiling and  executing
 unaltered.    Programs    exploiting    highly  machine-dependent  or
 UNIX-specific features will require some conversion effort.

 Run-Time Library for C Applications

 The DEC C Run-Time  Library  is  distributed  with  the  OpenVMS  VAX
 Operating System V6.0-V6.1.  (Prior  to  OpenVMS VAX Operating System
 V6.0, the Run-Time Library was included  in  the  DEC C product.) The
 DEC  C  Run-Time  Library  provides  shareable  routines  to  perform
 input/output,  character    and    string    handling,   mathematical
 computations,  memory allocation,  and  emulation  of  selected  UNIX
 features.

 Run-time Library Redistribution

 The DEC C kit  includes  a separately packaged saveset which contains
 all the run-time components needed to execute programs developed with
 the  DEC C compiler and class  libraries  on  supported  OpenVMS  VAX
 system    configurations.    Digital  grants  you  a    nonexclusive,
 royalty-free,  worldwide  right  to  reproduce  and  distribute  this
 saveset portion of the DEC C kit designated as AACRT060.A (the "RTL")
 provided that you:

 o  distribute  the  entire RTL saveset and copies of its accompanying
    documentation;

 o  distribute  the  RTL only in conjunction with and as part of  your
    software application  product  which is designed to operate in the
    OpenVMS VAX environment;

 o  do not use  Digital's  name,  logo,  or  trademarks to market your
    software application product;

 o  include Digital's copyright notice  for DEC C on your product disk
    label and/or on the title  page  of  the  documentation  for  your
    software application product;  and



                                  4

 

 o  agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and  defend  Digital  from  and
    against  any claims or lawsuits, including attorney's  fees,  that
    arise  or  result from the use or distribution  of  your  software
    application product.  Except as expressly provided herein, Digital
    grants no  implied  or  express  license under any of its patents,
    copyrights, trade secrets,  trademarks,  or  any  license or other
    proprietary interests and rights.
