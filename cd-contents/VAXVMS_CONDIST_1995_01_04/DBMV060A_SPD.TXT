 DEC DBMS is a multi-user, general purpose CODASYL-compliant database
 management system that runs under the OpenVMS VAX operating system.
 DEC DBMS is used to access and administer databases ranging in com-
 plexity from simple hierarchies to complex networks with multi-level
 relationships. It supports full concurrent access in a multi-user en-
 vironment without compromising the integrity and security of the user's
 databases.

 Data Definition

 DEC DBMS has a four-part data definition language. The schema DDL de-
 fines the logical structure of the database, the storage schema DDL
 defines the physical structure of the database, the subschema DDL de-
 fines application program views of the schema, and the security schema
 DDL defines access rights to database objects.

 The schema DDL is the only DDL that must be written. By default, the
 DDL compiler produces a default subschema, storage schema, and secu-
 rity schema for every schema it compiles.

 The schema DDL defines the records, sets, and areas composing the database.
 A record is a collection of data items. A set is a relationship be-
 tween records having one owner record and one or more member records
 in some specified order. An area is a logical and physical subdivi-
 sion of the database that contains records.

 The storage schema DDL defines the representation of storage records,
 storage sets, and storage areas (which are equivalent to OpenVMS files).
 It also defines the placement of records within the database, the stor-
 age set parameters, and the representation of data items within a stor-
 age record. Most database tuning is accomplished by changing the stor-
 age schema.

 DEC DBMS, Version 6.0,                                SPD 25.48.25
 for OpenVMS VAX

 The subschema DDL defines a logical subset of the database in terms
 of records, sets, and realms (a collection of one or more areas). Many
 subschemas can be written to provide different views of the database
 for different application programs.

 The security schema DDL defines the access rights to all database ob-
 jects. DML statement access rights for each user can be defined for
 each DML statement on areas, records, items, and sets.

 All database structure definitions are established and maintained by
 the DDL compiler and stored in the CDD/Repository for OpenVMS, where
 they can be retrieved by DEC DBMS utilities and DEC DATATRIEVE

 Data Manipulation

 Application programs must call the Database Control System (DBCS) for
 all database operations. The specific database operations supported
 are: CONNECT, DISCONNECT, ERASE, FETCH, FIND, GET, MODIFY, RECONNECT,
 and STORE for manipulating database records and sets; FREE and KEEP
 for saving and purging database currencies and keeplists; COMMIT, READY,
 and ROLLBACK for controlling the permanence in nondistributed trans-
 actions; ALSO, EMPTY, MEMBER, OWNER, TENANT, NULL, and WITHIN condi-
 tions for testing the state of the database, currencies, and keeplists.
 A Boolean expression with EQ, NE, LE, LT, GT, GE, AND, OR, NOT, MATCHES,
 or CONTAINS operators can be used on the FIND and FETCH statements.

 Application programs written in FORTRAN perform database operations
 with a set of Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements included in
 the source code. FORTRAN DML statements are translated by the DEC DBMS
 FORTRAN DML Preprocessor into FORTRAN source code that is compiled by
 the DEC Fortran compiler. Application programs written in C, Pascal,
 PL/I, and DEC Ada can access a database through a generic DML prepro-
 cessor. DML statements can be included directly into the program. The
 source file is then passed on to the appropriate host language com-
 piler.

 Run-Time Environment (Integrity and Consistency Features)

 DEC DBMS, Version 6.0,                                SPD 25.48.25
 for OpenVMS VAX

 The Database Control System (DBCS) controls access to DEC DBMS databases.
 The DBCS ensures the integrity of user databases by automatically lock-
 ing records that have been modified, records representing currencies,
 and records on keeplists. Optionally, the DBA can request that all records
 read in a particular database be locked for the life of the database
 transaction. Users cannot modify data in records that are locked by
 another user. Moreover, users cannot read data that another user has
 modified but not yet committed. When a user process terminates or ex-
 ecutes a ROLLBACK or COMMIT operation, all locks are released. When
 a user process executes a COMMIT RETAINING operation, all record locks
 not in currency indicators or keeplists are released and all records
 locked for update are changed to read locks. Locking of entire areas
 can be used to improve performance in certain applications. The Open-
 VMS lock manager services ($ENQ and $DEQ) are used for locking.

 All database changes between READY and COMMIT or ROLLBACK operations
 are recorded in a recovery-unit journal. When a user performs a COM-
 MIT operation, all database changes are made permanent. A ROLLBACK op-
 eration will undo all database changes.

 The DBCS automatically performs a ROLLBACK operation on any uncommit-
 ted database changes if a program error or system failure occurs. Recovery-
 unit journaling can be disabled by readying an AREA in BATCH UPDATE
 mode, which can result in improved performance. A risk of disabling
 the recovery-unit journaling is that the database might be corrupted
 should a system failure occur.

 The BATCH RETRIEVAL ready mode, also called a snapshot, can be used
 by retrieval transactions that read many records, require a consis-
 tent view of the database, and do not handle deadlock conditions. A
 database must have snapshots allowed to enable transactions in BATCH
 RETRIEVAL mode; snapshots may be enabled per area.

 Optionally, long-term after-images can be saved and used by the DBO
 utility to recover from storage device or system software failures.
 This approach is strongly recommended.

 VAXcluster Environment

 DEC DBMS, Version 6.0,                                SPD 25.48.25
 for OpenVMS VAX

 DEC DBMS databases can operate in a VAXcluster environment, thus al-
 lowing for concurrent, multiple-node database access. DEC DBMS auto-
 matically recovers the database if a processor in the VAXcluster fails
 and provides optional after-image journaling to further protect the
 integrity of the VAXcluster database.

 DEC DBMS uses the OpenVMS distributed lock manager to synchronize cluster-
 wide updates to the database root file, to initiate the automatic re-
 covery process when a node fails, and to coordinate concurrent updates
 to the same database from processes running on different nodes. Prop-
 erly configured VAXcluster configurations offer higher availability
 to DEC DBMS database applications.

 Security Features

 DEC DBMS provides security on database objects via the security schema,
 on DBO commands via access control lists, on files via the OpenVMS file
 protection features, and on metadata in the CDD/Repository dictionary
 via the CDD/Repository security features.

 Application programs access the database through a security schema.
 The security schema controls the access to areas, records, items, and
 sets for each DML statement. The security schema for a given user is
 controlled by the User Execution List (UEL), which is an access con-
 trol list. The UEL consists of user identification codes (UIC) and the
 security schema through which they are allowed access to the database.
 UELs are manipulated by the database administrator through the use of
 the DBO/PERMIT_USER command.

 Access to DBO commands is controlled by an access control list for each
 DBO command. The Command Authorization Lists (CALs) are manipulated
 by the Database Administrator with the command DBO/GRANT_COMMAND. There
 is a CAL for every DBO command except MONITOR, SHOW, and CONVERT. There
 is no CAL for the CDD commands.

 The DBCS runs in EXEC mode, securing its code and data structures from
 the user's user mode applications.

 DEC DBMS, Version 6.0,                                SPD 25.48.25
 for OpenVMS VAX

 DEC DBMS uses standard OpenVMS file security (SYSTEM, OWNER, GROUP,
 WORLD) to protect database storage areas (files). An application pro-
 gram can only access records defined in its SUBSCHEMA. It is the re-
 sponsibility of the Database Administrator (DBA) to define storage ar-
 eas and realms plus set up file protection and access control lists
 and security schemas to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.

 Metadata security and protection can be provided by preventing access
 to metadata definitions stored in the CDD/Repository. The CDD supports
 a hierarchical security system based on access control lists. It is
 the responsibility of the DBA to define CDD access control lists to
 prevent unauthorized access to sensitive database definitions.

 Tracking and reporting of access to a secured database environment is
 provided through the DBO utility. Profiles for this security track-
 ing can be defined and activated for individual Security Schemas, as
 well as securable database commands. The result is an audit trail of
 all secured database access for a particular database.

 Optional SQL Access Capability

 DEC DB Integrator Gateway for DBMS provides OpenVMS and desktop ap-
 plications with direct, SQL-based, read/update access to DBMS databases.
 Local and remote DEC SQL and DEC Rdb applications are supported through
 interactive, dynamic and embedded SQL interfaces. Support for client
 /server access is provided by the SQL/Services facility and the DEC
 ODBC Driver for MS[R] Windows[TM] Open Database Database Connectiv-
 ity (ODBC) clients. Optional embedded SQL and SQL module language pro-
 gramming support is available. For more information refer to SPD 51.13.xx.

 Product Assistance Facilities

 DEC DBMS provides extensive help facilities for the interactive DML
 utility (DBQ), the DML precompiler(DML), the Database Operator util-
 ity (DBO), and the DDL compiler. The help files contain all necessary
 information on the use of each of these facilities.

 DEC DATATRIEVE provides an optional interface to DEC DBMS database struc-
 tures. This provides the DEC DBMS user with a high-level, nonproce-
 dural query and report generating facility.

 Components

 DDL Compiler (DDL) - Used by the Database Administrator (DBA) to cre-
 ate and maintain database structure definitions including records, sets,
 areas, and realms in the CDD/Repository. It compiles the schema, sub-
 schema, storage schema, and security schema DDLs, and generates de-
 fault subschemas, storage schemas, and security schemas. The OpenVMS
 DCL command "DDL" invokes the compiler.

 Database Control System (DBCS) - Controls access to DEC DBMS databases.
 The DBCS is a shareable image that is linked with any application pro-
 gram that accesses the database.

 FORTRAN DML Preprocessor (FDML) - Preprocesses FORTRAN DML applica-
 tion programs. It translates FORTRAN DML statements into FORTRAN calls
 to the DBCS and data definition statements and passes the complete FOR-
 TRAN source program to the DEC Fortran Compiler.

 Generic DML Preprocessor - Preprocesses application programs written
 in C, Pascal and DEC Ada. It converts DML statements into calls to the
 DBCS and passes the complete source program to the host language com-
 piler.

 Database Monitor Process - Controls all interprocess database commu-
 nication and recovery.

 Database Recovery Process (DBR) - Provides the database recovery ca-
 pability.

 Interactive DML utility (DBQ) - Provides interactive DML access to any
 DEC DBMS database.

 Database Operator utility (DBO) - Used by the DBA to create, maintain,
 delete, and control all DEC DBMS databases. The OpenVMS DCL command
 "DBO" invokes the utility.

 Database Restructuring Utility (DRU) - Enables the DBA to make user-
 data dependent changes to the database.

 DBMSERVER - Provides access to local databases for remote DECnet users.

 Installation Verification Procedures (IVP) - Verifies the correct in-
 stallation of all DEC DBMS components and builds the PARTS database
 that is used in examples throughout the documentation.

 Demonstration (DEMO) - A demonstration package which uses the PARTS
 database.

 for OpenVMS VAX

 o  Maximum number of areas (files) per database is 32K files (Open-
    VMS resources and typical SYSGEN parameters will constrain this to
    be much lower).

 o  Maximum length of a storage record, including DBMS overhead, is 32K
    bytes.

 o  Minimum interval between SPAM pages is 256 pages.

 o  Maximum interval between SPAM pages is 64K pages.

 o  Maximum number of concurrent users per database is 2,032 (not all
    database maintenance functions can be performed efficiently with
    large numbers of active users).

 Application Portability

 DEC DBMS DML and FDML applications may be ported from the OpenVMS VAX
 to OpenVMS AXP by recompiling and relinking the programs using DEC DBMS
 for OpenVMS AXP and the OpenVMS AXP implementation of the appropri-
 ate language compiler(s). Differences in the 3GL compiler version or
 implementation may make minor changes to the source code necessary.
 This approach assumes that the source code is available and an equiv-
 alent 3GL compiler is available for use on the OpenVMS AXP Operating
 System.

 In cases where either the source code or the required compiler is not
 available but the OpenVMS VAX object code for the application is avail-
 able, the DECmigrate product may be used to port the application to
 the OpenVMS AXP Operating System. This product translates OpenVMS VAX
 application images for use under OpenVMS AXP. DML applications which
 will be processed using DECmigrate must first be relinked under DEC
 DBMS for OpenVMS VAX with the DECmigrate support library provided with
 the DEC DBMS for OpenVMS VAX software distribution.

 for OpenVMS VAX

 A Run-Time Only version of DEC DBMS is available. It provides all fea-
 tures and facilities except the DDL compiler, the FORTRAN Data Manip-
 ulation Language (FDML) preprocessor, and the Generic DML preproces-
 sor. The purpose of the Run-Time Only version is to support the ex-
 ecution of applications on one machine that have been developed on other
 machines using the development version of the product. Program devel-
 opment is not supported under the Run-Time Only version.
