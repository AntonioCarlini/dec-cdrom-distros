 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC SNA Domain Gateway, Version 2.0     SPD 38.69.02

 DESCRIPTION

 The DEC SNA Domain Gateway (Domain Gateway) is a member of Digital's
 family of DEC SNA network transport products. This family consists of
 hardware and software products that connect suitably configured net-
 worked systems in a Digital environment with suitably configured IBM[R]
 systems in a Systems Network Architecture (SNA) environment. With ap-
 propriate OpenVMS, ULTRIX, DEC OSF/1[R], Windows[TM], and MS-DOS[R]
 access routines, users can exchange information and share resources
 between Digital and IBM networked systems in a bidirectional manner.

 The Domain Gateway is managed and configured using the management soft-
 ware that is part of the Domain Gateway product.

 The Domain Gateway supports TCP/IP and DECnet/OSI network protocols.
 Networks using these protocols are refered to as the non-SNA networks.
 The Domain Gateway is part of both the SNA network and the non-SNA net-
 work. Architecturally, it is a DECnet/OSI and/or TCP/IP end node and
 an SNA Physical Unit Type 5 (PU T5) node. The Domain Gateway appears
 to the SNA network as an SNA Domain that contains one subarea.

 The DEC SNA Domain Gateway software is supported on two DEC ChannelServer
 hardware platforms (the DEC ChannelServer II [DESNB-Ax] and the DEC
 ChannelServer [DESNA-Ax]) and two DEC MicroServer hardware platforms
 (the DEC MicroServer [DEMSA-Ax] and the DEC MicroServer-SP [DEMSB-Ax]).
 When used with the Domain Gateway software, each of these hardware prod-
 ucts provides SNA connectivity to any DECnet/OSI, DECnet Phase IV or
 TCP/IP system in the non-SNA network.



                               DIGITAL                 November 1994

                                                         AE-PN5UC-TE



 Both DEC ChannelServer hardware units connect directly to an Ether-
 net local area network (LAN) using a standard Ethernet transceiver ca-
 ble, and to an IBM S/370 Block Multiplexer channel using a single set
 of Bus and Tag connectors. The combination of the Domain Gateway soft-
 ware and one of the ChannelServer hardware units is referred to as a
 Domain Gateway-CT.

 Both DEC MicroServer hardware units connect directly to an Ethernet
 LAN using a standard Ethernet transceiver cable. The DEC MicroServer
 hardware unit connects to up to four front-end communications controllers
 (37xx-style) using standard synchronous data lines and modems. These
 front-end processors must all be in the same SNA network. The DEC MicroServer-
 SP hardware unit connects to a single front-end communications con-
 troller (37xx-style) using a standard synchronous data line and mo-
 dem. The combination of the Domain Gateway software and one of the Mi-
 croServer hardware units is referred to as a Domain Gateway-ST.

 This product can be used in networks currently using other DEC SNA Gate-
 way systems and can share access routines, Ethernet LANs, and load host
 resources with those systems.

 The Domain Gateway supports a single PU with its own System Services
 Control Point (SSCP). The Gateway supports up to 16 explicit routes
 for each destination subarea in the SNA network, supports IBM Class
 of Service capability, and allows up to 8 virtual routes (each of which
 can have 3 transmission priority levels) for each explicit route. The
 Domain Gateway-CT and the Domain Gateway-ST running on the DEC MicroServer-
 SP (DEMSB-Ax) hardware platform support a single Transmission Group
 (TG). The Domain Gateway-ST running on the DEC MicroServer (DEMSA-Ax)
 hardware platform supports multiple (up to 4) TGs and multilink TGs.

 The Domain Gateway-CT supports the configuration of up to 1024 Log-
 ical Units (LUs) and the Domain Gateway-ST supports up to 128 LUs. All
 LUs can have multiple sessions. Table 1 shows the maximum number of
 active LU-LU sessions supported by the four hardware platforms.

 Because the Domain Gateway is a PU T5 implementation, it enables DEC-
 net/OSI-based applications to be either Primary Logical Units (PLUs)
 or Secondary Logical Units (SLUs) when communicating with IBM appli-
 cations and peripheral devices. This means that suitably configured
 Digital-based applications can be interactively accessed from IBM SNA
 networked 3270 devices and PCs.

 Features Common to all Domain Gateways

 o  Implements an SNA PU T5

 o  Multiple session support for each LU

 o  Supports applications acting as either PLUs or SLUs

 o  Provides access to OpenVMS and DEC OSF/1 applications from SNA 3270
    devices and PCs

 o  Implements IBM Class of Service support

 o  Supports SNA Explicit Routes, Virtual Routes, and Transmission Pri-
    ority Levels

 o  Supports a wide variety of access routines

 o  Supports IBM MVS, VM, and VSE systems

 o  Gateway Configuration Utility simplifies installation and config-
    uration

 o  Gateway Management Utilities simplify management and troubleshoot-
    ing

 o  Supports SNA-initiated outbound sessions

 o  DECnet/OSI and/or TCP/IP end node implementation

 o  Access from DECnet Phase IV systems

 o  TN3270 Server support (Requires DEC OSF/1 based Load Host system)

 Features Unique to the Domain Gateway-CT

 o  Supports high bandwidth communication using a block multiplexer chan-
    nel attachment to an IBM mainframe

 o  Supports up to 1020 active sessions (510 session on the DEC Chan-
    nelServer)

 o  Upward compatible with DECnet SNA Gateway for Channel Transport

 Features Unique to the Domain Gateway-ST

 o  Supports SNA synchronous communications using the SDLC protocol

 o  Supports SDLC's Extended Response Mode allowing a window modulo of
    128

 o  Supports NRZI signaling mode on its synchronous data lines. This
    allows the Domain Gateway to support IBM data lines coded with ei-
    ther the NORMAL or NRZI option for the IBM NCP LINE resource def-
    inition.

 o  Supports FULL duplex transmission on its synchronous data lines.
    This allows data to be sent and received simultaneously. This set-
    ting corresponds to the DATMODE = FULL option for the IBM NCP PU
    resource definition.

 o  Supports up to 128 active sessions (depending on software license)

                                  4

 Loading DEC SNA Gateway Software

 The Domain Gateway software is downline loaded into one of the DEC Chan-
 nelServer or DEC MicroServer products over the Ethernet LAN from an
 OpenVMS VAX system acting as a DECnet load host system. Most OpenVMS-
 based VAX, MicroVAX, VAXserver, or VAXstation systems can be used as
 Domain Gateway load hosts. The Domain Gateway software can also be down-
 line loaded from an Alpha AXP DEC OSF/1 system. The HARDWARE REQUIRE-
 MENTS section describes valid configurations.

 Other networked systems requiring access to the SNA environment through
 the Domain Gateway, should be configured with the appropriate SNA ac-
 cess routines.

 When loaded on one of the two DEC ChannelServer hardware units, the
 Domain Gateway appears to the SNA network as an IBM 3088 Channel-to-
 Channel Adapter (CTCA) and system programmers configure the IBM chan-
 nel address as a 3088 device according to specifications listed in both
 the hardware and software user documentation.

 When loaded on one of the two DEC MicroServer hardware units, the Do-
 main Gateway appears to adjacent front-end processors as another front-
 end processor and appears to IBM hosts in the SNA network as another
 IBM host. IBM system programmers should configure the adjacent front-
 end processors and adjacent IBM hosts according to specifications listed
 in both the hardware and software user documentation.

 Components

 The DEC SNA Domain Gateway software includes two software components:
 the Domain Gateway Load Host software (with its Configuration Util-
 ity), and the Domain Gateway Management software.

 Gateway Load Host Software

 The Domain Gateway load host software includes the system image that
 is down-line loaded to one of the supported hardware units and the Con-
 figuration Utility that provides a convenient method for configuring
 the Domain Gateway.

                                  6



 The Configuration Utility allows Gateway managers to save answers and
 to modify discrete parts of the configuration. The Configuration Util-
 ity can also read path definition files created by IBM network def-
 inition utilities and use that information in the Domain Gateway con-
 figuration.

 Because the Domain Gateway supports multiple sessions per LU, the Do-
 main Gateway manager can configure a single LU for those access rou-
 tines which support multiple sessions, thus reducing configuration time.

 Most Alpha AXP DEC OSF/1 and OpenVMS-based VAX, MicroVAX, VAXserver,
 and VAXstation systems can serve as Domain Gateway load hosts.

 Gateway Management Software

 The Domain Gateway Management software includes DECnet-style network
 management tools for configuring, controlling, monitoring, and trou-
 bleshooting the Domain Gateway. The Domain Gateway manager can set up
 or modify parameters relating to routes, physical units, logical units,
 and other key variables necessary for network-to-network communica-
 tions between the SNA and non-SNA networks. Additionally, the Domain
 Gateway Management software allows the manager to diagnose and solve
 most problems related to the Domain Gateway. On DEC OSF/1 systems these
 DECnet-style network management tools are also available in a TCP/IP
 only environment.

 Although all management of the Domain Gateway is performed from a Gate-
 way management node in the non-SNA network, the management of the Do-
 main Gateway's SNA components is conceptually part of the management
 of the IBM SNA network. Therefore, the management of the routes and
 the data links connecting the Domain Gateway to the IBM network is the
 joint responsibility of the IBM system or network programmer and the
 Domain Gateway manager. (Refer to the CUSTOMER RESPONSIBILITIES sec-
 tion of this Software Product Description.)

 The Domain Gateway Management software includes support for Network
 Control Language (NCL) commands, a monitoring utility (SNAP), and Com-
 mon Trace Facility (CTF) analysis routines. The SNAP utility displays
 the status of the Domain Gateway's buffer availability, the number of
 SNA sessions in progress, and information about the non-SNA and SNA

                                  7



 networks. The CTF analysis routines help debug application programs
 and assist in identifying system problems by capturing and analyzing
 multi-protocol data. CTF can be used at the Transmission Group, Vir-
 tual Route, Logical Unit, or session level.

 The Domain Gateway Management software resides on a Gateway load host
 system or, optionally, on additional nodes called Domain Gateway man-
 agement nodes.

 Most Alpha AXP DEC OSF/1 and OpenVMS-based VAX, MicroVAX, VAXserver,
 and VAXstation systems can serve as Domain Gateway management hosts.

 Access Routines

 OpenVMS, ULTRIX, DEC OSF/1, Windows, or MS-DOS-based Digital access
 routines can use the Domain Gateway. The Domain Gateway supports Digital-
 supplied access routines as either SLUs or PLUs. For example, the MEP
 VT for DEC SNA 3270 Applications Services access routine enables 3270
 terminals in an SNA network to connect to applications on OpenVMS sys-
 tems. For additional information about supported access routines, see
 the OPTIONAL SOFTWARE section.

 Compatibility with Digital's DECnet SNA Gateways

 The Domain Gateway works with all of Digital's DECnet SNA access rou-
 tines except the Distributed Host Command Facility (DHCF). The access
 routines are described in the Access Routines section of this SPD. The
 Domain Gateway does not have an Remote Job Entry (RJE) server. Rather,
 the DECnet SNA RJE access routine uses an OpenVMS-based RJE server.
 Also note that the management utilities used for previous DECnet SNA
 Gateways, such as SNANCP, NCP, and NETTRACE, are not supported by the
 Domain Gateway.

 Processors Not Supported:

 MicroVAX I, VAXstation I, VAX-11/725, VAX-11/782, VAXstation 8000

 Additional Processor Requirements

 Every load host on which the Domain Gateway software is installed must
 contain:

 o  A valid system configuration for the relevant operating system and
    the supporting networking software product; refer to Software Prod-
    uct Descriptions (SPDs) and to the SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS section.

 o  A supported connection on the same Ethernet LAN as the DEC SNA Do-
    main Gateway

 o  An appropriate device available to read the software during instal-
    lation - TK50 drive or CD-ROM

 Disk Block Space Requirements

 Disk space required   VAX/OpenVMS 55,000 blocks (28MB)
 for installation:



                                 13




                       DEC OSF/1 5 MB

 Disk space required   VAX/OpenVMS 45,000 blocks (23 MB)
 for use (permanent):

                       DEC OSF/1 5 MB

 These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
 sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
 system environment, configuration, and software options.

 In addition to disk space allocated to the Domain Gateway software,
 some disk space (approximately 8K - 10K blocks) should be reserved for
 any dump files that may be generated by the Domain Gateway. The lo-
 cation of these dump files is determined by the system administrator.
 In addition, each Domain Gateway configured will require additional
 disk space for configuration scripts (upwards of 40 blocks [20 KB]).

 Communications Hardware Required:

 Domain Gateway software runs on four hardware platforms: the DEC Chan-
 nelServer, the DEC ChannelServer II, the DEC MicroServer, and the DEC
 MicroServer-SP.

 DEC ChannelServer and DEC ChannelServer II

 The DEC ChannelServer II is available in the following forms:

 o  DESNB-AA for use with 120 V AC power supplies

 o  DESNB-AB for use with 240 V AC power supplies

 The DEC ChannelServer is no longer available but is supported by the
 Domain Gateway software in the following forms:

 o  DESNA-AA for use with 120 V AC power supplies

 o  DESNA-AB for use with 240 V AC power supplies

 Each of the DEC ChannelServers has a built-in Ethernet LAN controller,
 but needs a suitable connection to connect to the customer's Ether-
 net LAN along with any extension cables.

                                 14



 In addition, S/370 Bus and Tag cables (with terminators if appropri-
 ate) are required for connection into the S/370 system.

 Note: A raised floor environment is required for installation of a DEC
 ChannelServer II system.

 DEC MicroServer and DEC MicroServer-SP

 The DEC MicroServer is available in the following forms:

 o  DEMSA-AA for use with 120 V AC power supplies

 o  DEMSA-AB for use with 240 V AC power supplies

 The DEC MicroServer-SP is available in the following forms:

 o  DEMSB-AA for use with 120 V AC power supplies

 o  DEMSB-AB for use with 240 V AC power supplies

 Each of the DEC MicroServers has a built-in Ethernet LAN controller,
 but needs a suitable connection to connect to the customer's Ether-
 net LAN along with any extension cables.

 Each of the DEC MicroServers uses adapter cables to provide the nec-
 essary interchange circuits at the appropriate electrical interface
 types and ISO standard connections for each synchronous line. The DEC
 MicroServer-SP supports a single synchronous line; therefore, it re-
 quires a single adapter cable. The DEC MicroServer supports up to four
 synchronous lines, therefore, it requires up to four adapter cables.
 Table 3 shows the cable number for each of the supported electrical
 interfaces.

 SOFTWARE LICENSING

 Customers need a separate license for each hardware unit they load with
 the Domain Gateway software (except as otherwise specified by Digi-
 tal). The DEC SNA Domain Gateway license applies to the hardware unit
 on which the software executes, not to the load host processor on which
 the software is configured.

 The single Domain Gateway license agreement includes the right to in-
 stall and configure the product on a backup load host, in standby mode,
 for downline loading the Domain Gateway in case of a failure at the
 primary load host. This backup load host installation requires dupli-
 cate installation of the primary Product Access Key (PAK).

 Under the terms of the software license, the Domain Gateway manage-
 ment utilities which are included in this product (NCL commands, SNAP,
 and CTF analysis routines) may be installed freely on alternate Gate-
 way management nodes in addition to the load host. A PAK is not nec-
 essary to install or execute the management utilities.

 This software is furnished under the licensing provision of Digital
 Equipment Corporation's Standard Terms and Conditions. For more in-
 formation about Digital's licensing terms and policies, contact the
 local Digital office.

 License Management Facility Support

 This product supports the License Management Facility on OpenVMS and
 DEC OSF/1.

 SOFTWARE PRODUCT SERVICES

 Domain Gateway Orientation and Installation Service

 The Domain Gateway Orientation/Installation Service is SUGGESTED in
 conjunction with the customer's first purchase of a DEC SNA Domain Gate-
 way if the installation is to be warranted and supported by Digital.
 (Note: An Upgrade Service is available if upgrading from a DECnet SNA
 Gateway for Channel Transport or DECnet SNA Gateway for Synchronous
 Transport to the Domain Gateway.) The purpose of this service is to
 ensure that the installation of the Domain Gateway is complete and that
 start-up problems are eliminated. It includes the following activi-
 ties:

 o  Verify IBM and Digital hardware and software prerequisites

 o  Coordinate customer MIS and Digital Software Services resources

 o  Review IBM system generation parameters

 o  Install the Domain Gateway and any load host resident OpenVMS Gate-
    way access routine software which has been ordered concurrently with
    the Domain Gateway for the first load host

 o  Verify connectivity between installed access routines and the IBM
    system if they have been preconfigured according to the guidelines
    provided by Digital for those products. The following access rou-
    tines qualify for this verification:

    o  DECnet SNA VMS 3270 Terminal Emulation

    o  DECnet SNA VMS Printer Emulation

    o  DECnet SNA VMS Remote Job Entry

    o  DECnet SNA Data Transfer Facility

    o  DEC SNA 3270 Application Services

    o  MEP VT for DEC SNA 3270 Application Services

    o  DECwindows SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator for OSF/1

                                 29



 Connectivity verification of the Domain Gateway with access routine
 products, other than those listed above, will be done using the In-
 stallation Verification Procedure (IVP) supplied with each access rou-
 tine.

 An installation service is available for the simultaneous installa-
 tion of the access routines on additional Alpha AXP, VAX, RISC, or MS-DOS
 systems.

 Digital will provide these services upon customer notification that
 the system, including all prerequisite hardware and software, is ready
 for installation according to the guidelines listed in the Customer
 Responsibilities section of this Software Product Description. Con-
 tact the Area Digital Sales Office for additional information on these
 services.
