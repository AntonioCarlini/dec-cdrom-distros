   PRODUCT NAME:  DEC DB Integrator, Version 3.1          SPD 47.25.03

   DESCRIPTION

   DEC DB Integrator (DBI) is a multi-database management system that pro-
   vides users with the capability to transparently access and update data
   stored in multiple databases, in distributed locations, and with mul-
   tiple data formats. DEC DB Integrator enables users and applications
   to access this data as if it were located in a single, local database
   without regard to the actual location of the data or to the functional
   limitations of the underlying data managers.

   DBI services are accessible to a wide variety of client applications
   over DECnet, TCP/IP, AppleTalk[R] and IPX/SPX networks using SQL, SQL/Services
   and the DEC ODBC Driver for MS[R] Windows[TM] application programming
   interfaces (APIs). DEC DB Integrator clients access underlying data
   sources via a full-featured implementation of SQL data manipulation
   language (DML).

   DEC DB Integrator provides clients with both remote request and dis-
   tributed request capabilities against underlying data sources. These
   sources, called link databases, include DEC Rdb, DEC DBMS, IBM[R] DB2[TM],
   ORACLE[R], SYBASE[R] databases, Digital Standard M (DSM) globals, VMS
   RMS files and VSAM data sets. Data sources other than DEC Rdb are ac-
   cessed through DB Integrator gateways.

   The DB Integrator Gateway for EDA/SQL[TM] and the DB Integrator Gate-
   way for SequeLink[TM] extend this integrated access to INGRES[R], IN-
   FORMIX[R], AS/400, DB2/6000, DB2/2 and the many other data sources ac-
   cessible via SequeLink and EDA/SQL servers.

                                                           AE-Q1YXD-TE

 



   DEC DB Integrator, Version 3.1                        SPD 47.25.03


   The DEC DBI Gateway for Custom Drivers enables integrated access to
   data sources that are not accessible though the existing set of DBI
   gateways.


   Features

   o  Multi-Database Management - Information from multiple link databases
      can be integrated into a single federated database through the use
      of DEC DB Integrator and the required DEC DB Integrator gateways.

      Users can directly query DEC DB Integrator metadata to determine
      the availability and source of data within the federated database.

   o  Local Autonomy - Link databases are managed as independent enti-
      ties; DB Integrator imposes no restrictions on other uses of the
      underlying databases. Synchronizing DEC DB Integrator metadata with
      corresponding metadata in the link databases is accomplished through
      two DBA functions: one to update the DEC DB Integrator metadata for
      a specific table, the other to refresh only the table's statistics.

   o  Location Transparency - Remote and local data sources are accessed
      as if they reside in a single, local database. Tables may be joined
      with each other independent of the location of the link databases
      in which they physically reside.

   o  Functional Transparency - All data is accessed via a single imple-
      mentation of ANSI/ISO standard DEC SQL. Link database capabilities
      are supplemented by services provided by DBI and DBI gateways so
      that clients have access to a single, uniformly functional, fed-
      erated database.

      Some capabilities, such as identifying a record by its internal database
      object identifier (DB Key) or integration with DECdtm, the Digital
      implementation of the two phase commit (2PC) protocol, depend to-
      tally on link database capabilities and are not available for all
      link databases.

   o  Partitioned Views - Several similar tables located at different sites
      can be presented to clients as a single, horizontally partitioned
      table.

   DEC DB Integrator, Version 3.1                        SPD 47.25.03


   o  Client Interoperability - Client applications with interfaces to
      the DEC ODBC Driver for MS Windows or the SQL/Services API can ac-
      cess DEC DB Integrator services via a SQL/Services server and DECnet,
      TCP/IP, AppleTalk or IPX/SPX network transports[1].

   o  Compatibility - Applications designed to work with DEC SQL data ma-
      nipulation language (DML) through either the compiled or dynamic
      SQL interfaces will work with DEC DB Integrator without any mod-
      ification other than changing the database name.

   o  Performance - DB Integrator accelerates the response time of com-
      plex queries/updates through distributed optimization techniques
      designed to minimize the movement of data across the network. The
      DB Integrator distributed query optimizer is both cost-based and
      capabilities-based resulting in efficient strategies for process-
      ing of user requests. Runaway queries may be controlled by limit-
      ing the CPU time, elapsed time and/or the rows returned by a spe-
      cific client request.

   o  Distributed Unit of Work Support - DEC DB Integrator uses DECdtm
      services to provide a transparent, two phase commit (2PC) for dis-
      tributed transactions that span multiple DEC Rdb databases, DEC DBMS
      databases or RMS files. DEC DB Integrator may be configured to al-
      low distributed updates across link databases that lack DECdtm sup-
      port. These updates may produce inconsistent results.

      Statement atomicity in distributed transactions is ensured through
      the use of the markpoint capabilities of the link database managers.

      For more information on DECdtm refer to the DEC OSF/1[R] AXP Op-
      erating System SPD (41.61.xx), the OpenVMS AXP Operating System SPD
      (42.18.xx) or the OpenVMS VAX Operating System SPD (25.01.xx).

   o  Data Dictionary Integration - Definitions of databases, domains,
      fields, tables and views may be maintained through the use of
      CDD/Repository. Sharing common definitions across databases and ap-
      plications fosters the consistent use of data within an organiza-
      tion.

   o  Security - DEC DB Integrator presents itself to the link databases
      as a user. Both responsibility for, and control of data access re-
      mains with the administrators of these link databases. Database ad-
      ministrators can control access to DEC DB Integrator metadata through
      privilege-based security mechanisms. DEC DB Integrator encrypts the
      proxy information it uses to attach to link databases.

   o  Data Type Support - All DEC SQL data types are supported. Data types
      unique to the link database managers are transparently mapped to
      corresponding DEC SQL data types.

   o  Language Support - Precompilers for DEC Ada, DEC C, DEC COBOL, Mi-
      cro Focus COBOL, DEC Fortran, DEC Pascal, and PL/I for OpenVMS are
      available with the purchase of a Full Development Option.[2]

   o  Data Integrity - Access to link databases will not override the busi-
      ness rules established in, and enforced by, the data managers of
      those databases.

   CONFORMANCE TO STANDARDS

   DEC DB Integrator complies with the International Standard, ISO/IEC
   9075:1992 and the American National Standard, ANSI X3.135-1992, Database
   Language SQL, Entry-Level specification, and the Federal Information
   Processing Standard for Database Language SQL (FIPS SQL) as defined
   in FIPS PUB 127-2.

   The DEC ODBC Driver for MS Windows complies with the Microsoft[R] Open
   Database Connectivity specification V1.0. It supports all Core and Level
   1 calls and many, but not all, Level 2 calls.




   ____________________

     tion of language precompiler support by platform.
