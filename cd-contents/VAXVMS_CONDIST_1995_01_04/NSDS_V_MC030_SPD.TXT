   PRODUCT NAME:  DEC DB Integrator Gateway for RMS       SPD 32.88.06
                  Version 3.0C for OpenVMS VAX

   DESCRIPTION

   DEC DB Integrator Gateway for RMS for OpenVMS VAX (RMS Gateway) pro-
   vides applications and tools with direct read/write access to local
   OpenVMS Record Management Services (RMS) files and read/only access
   remote RMS files and IBM[R] MVS and VM/CMS data sets. These data sources
   may be accessed through either the gateway's interactive or dynamic
   SQL interfaces. Client/server access is supported through the SQL/Services
   facility and a driver for Microsoft[R] Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
   clients. Optional support for embedded SQL and SQL module language pro-
   gramming is available.

   The RMS Gateway stores the metadata for data sources either as CDO files
   or as CDD/Repository objects. When metadata is stored as CDO files the
   RMS Gateway accesses those files directly, without requiring the use
   of CDD/Repository.

   When used in conjunction with DEC DB Integrator (DBI) and other DBI
   gateways, the RMS Gateway enables the integration of RMS files and IBM
   MVS and VM/CMS data sets, with SYBASE[R], ORACLE[R], IBM DB2[TM], DEC
   Rdb, DEC DBMS and DEC DSM databases.

   The Custom Drivers Gateway runs under the OpenVMS VAX operating sys-
   tem on Digital VAX, MicroVAX, VAXstation, VAXserver and VAXft systems,
   servers and workstations.

   Version 3.0C for OpenVMS VAX

   Components

   Non-SQL Data Server

   The Non-SQL Data Server is the component that brings data and their
   definitions (metadata) together and makes them appear relational. The
   Non-SQL Data Server enables applications to access this non-relational
   data in a relational manner. The Non-SQL Data Server plans, optimizes,
   and executes read and write operations.

   VAX RMS Driver

   The VAX RMS driver contains the code specific to accessing RMS files
   and IBM MVS data sets. It utilizes RMS indexes in accessing the data
   when appropriate.

   Metadata Drivers

   The CDD/Repository for VMS driver contains the code specific to ac-
   cessing metadata in a CDD/Repository.

   The CDO source file driver contains the code specific to accessing meta-
   data directly from CDO statements in text files.

   Features

   Relational Access to Non-Relational Data
   The RMS Gateway allows applications to read and write to local RMS files
   using standard SQL syntax and programming interfaces. Transaction sup-
   port is provided by using DECdtm and RMS Journaling. The SQL "reserv-
   ing" option can be used when starting transactions to specify file ac-
   cess modes. Access to remote RMS files is limited to read-only.

   The RMS Gateway supports relational access to indexed, sequential and
   relative RMS files with fixed length records or with variable length
   records with fixed length control. Support for variable length and stream
   record formats is limited to the fixed portion of those records as de-
   fined in CDD/Repository or CDO statements in text files.

   Version 3.0C for OpenVMS VAX

   Read-only only access to IBM MVS and VM/CMS data sets (including VSAM)
   is provided through the DECnet/SNA Data Transfer Facility (DTF). For
   more information regarding file access using DTF, refer to the DEC-
   net/SNA Data Transfer Facility Software Product Description (SPD 27.85.xx).

   SQL Programming Interfaces

   The RMS Gateway includes interactive and dynamic SQL interfaces. The
   included SQL/Services facility supports the client/server implemen-
   tation style.

   o  The interactive SQL interface provides SQL data manipulation lan-
      guage (DML) support for insert, select, update, delete, join, project
      and order operations.

   o  The dynamic SQL interface compiles and executes SQL requests passed
      through its call interface. This programming approach is highly ef-
      fective in applications such as ad-hoc query where the exact pa-
      rameters of requests are not known until runtime. It is compati-
      ble with any programming language that supports the OpenVMS call-
      ing standard. The dynamic memory handling capabilities of Ada, PL/I
      and C enable these languages to take full advantage of the power
      and flexibility of this approach.

   o  The RMS Gateway performs data format translations for supported VMS
      datatypes as part of processing requests to read or update data.

   Desktop Connectivity

   Microsoft Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) applications can read from,
   and write to, RMS files and VM/CMS data sets using the DEC ODBC Driver
   for MS[R] Windows[TM]. This driver provides access to SQL/Services servers
   over DECnet or TCP/IP network transports. This driver also provides
   these applications with access to DEC Rdb databases, DBI and the other
   DBI gateways.

   Distributed Data Access

   The Custom Drivers Gateway supports access from remote clients and to
   remote Custom Driver databases.

   Integration with DEC SQL Applications

   RMS Gateway data sources are accessible by Digital information man-
   agement and end-user data access tools.

   o  DEC Data Distributor can maintain extracts and rollups of RMS Gate-
      way tables and views.

   o  DATATRIEVE queries, reports, and updates can combine data from RMS
      Gateways, other DBI gateways and DEC Rdb databases.

   o  DEC RALLY applications can query and report RMS Gateway data.

   Optional SQL Support

   Support for SQL application development is available with the optional
   purchase of development licenses for DEC SQL, DEC DB Integrator or DEC
   Rdb. These development licenses provides precompiler support for em-
   bedded SQL applications, a compiler for SQL module language programs
   and an application programming interface (API) to support the devel-
   opment of client/server applications.

   Embedded SQL programming places SQL language statements in line with
   host language statements. Precompilers replace these SQL statements
   with call statements and object modules. The modified host language
   program is compiled and linked with the object modules to form an ex-
   ecutable image. Precompilers for DEC C, DEC Ada, DEC COBOL, DEC For-
   tran, DEC Pascal and PL/I for OpenVMS are included.

   These precompilers support an optional Federal Information Process-
   ing Standards (FIPS) flagger that allows the user to identify any SQL
   statements which are not in the current ANSI/ISO SQL standard. An ex-
   ception flagger for the Multivendor Integration Architecture (MIA) stan-
   dard is also provided.

   The SQL module language processor allows SQL statements and multistate-
   ment procedures to be grouped into modules. When these modules are com-
   piled, the resulting object modules can be linked with objects cre-
   ated by any language compiler that complies with the OpenVMS calling
   standard. The SQL module language compiler also supports FIPS and MIA
   flagging.

   SQL/Services API programming libraries are used to interface client
   applications to the SQL/Services server. MS-DOS[R] or MS Windows client
   applications can be written in Microsoft C. Macintosh[R] client ap-
   plications can be written in MPW[TM] C or ThinkC.

   A development license also includes SQL/Services client programming
   libraries for Microsoft Windows, MS-DOS Sun[R], ULTRIX or OpenVMS plat-
   forms.

   Data Dictionary Support

   The optional use of CDD/Repository with the RMS Gateway encourages con-
   solidated maintenance of data definitions in a repository where they
   can be shared by all applications, databases and programming tools that
   use them.

   CONFORMANCE TO STANDARDS

   DEC DB Integrator Gateway for RMS partially implements the American
   National Standard Database Language SQL, ANSI X3.135-1992, Entry-Level
   specification.

   The DEC ODBC Driver for MS Windows complies with the Microsoft Open
   Database Connectivity specification V1.0. It supports all Core and Level
   1 calls and many, but not all, Level 2 calls.
