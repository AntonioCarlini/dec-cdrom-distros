 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC OSMS-Optical Storage Management Software     SPD
 47.46.02                for OpenVMS, Version 3.2

 DESCRIPTION

 The DEC Optical Storage Management Software for OpenVMS (DEC OSMS) prod-
 uct provides OpenVMS applications and users the functionality neces-
 sary to access an optical disk autochanger (jukebox) using the con-
 ventional device, file, and record access services provided by the Open-
 VMS Operating System. In most cases no changes will be required to ex-
 isting applications that use magnetic disk storage.

 The OpenVMS VAX version of DEC OSMS provides local access to rewritable,
 WORM (Write Once, Read Many), and multifunction autochangers, and VAX-
 cluster access to RW5xx autochangers using rewritable media only. The
 OpenVMS AXP version of DEC OSMS provides local access to RW5xx autochang-
 ers using rewritable media only at this time.

 Pseudo-Device Representation

 DEC OSMS allows the OpenVMS host to view the autochanger as a virtual
 set of disk devices. For single-headed drives, this translates to one
 virtual disk device for each optical disk surface in the autochanger.
 For example, Digital's RW530 autochanger has two single-headed opti-
 cal disk drives and 32 optical disk cartridge storage slots. Each stor-
 age slot holds one optical disk cartridge, so the autochanger has the
 capacity of 64 optical disk surfaces. The autochanger, therefore, ap-
 pears to applications as 64 virtual disk devices, named JBA0: through
 JBA63:. The JB devices are not physical devices; they are called pseudo-
 devices. Excluding those functions that are unique to the optical tech-
 nology, these pseudo-devices emulate the operation of a conventional
 OpenVMS magnetic disk.

 Volume Access

                               DIGITAL                     June 1994

                                                         AE-PXYMC-TE

 

 Volumes in an autochanger used with DEC OSMS are accessed using the
 same techniques that are used to access conventional OpenVMS disks.
 The standard OpenVMS INITIALIZE command is used to prepare each side
 of an optical disk cartridge for use and the standard OpenVMS MOUNT
 command is used to make the volume known to OpenVMS. WORM (Write Once)
 volumes can only be "initialized" once, whereas rewritable volumes,
 like magnetic disks, can be "initialized" multiple times. Once a vol-
 ume has been mounted, DEC OSMS manages the use of the physical opti-
 cal disk drives to allow volumes to remain logically mounted regard-
 less of where the volume is in the autochanger.

 File Access

 Files on volumes under control of DEC OSMS are accessed using the same
 techniques that are used to access conventional OpenVMS files. Once
 a volume has been mounted, files may be opened, read, written, and closed
 using the conventional OpenVMS system services and run-time library
 functions. Write Once (WORM) volumes use the WORMS-11[R] file system.
 Rewritable volumes use the FILES-11 file system.

 DEC OSMS provides essentially transparent access using standard Open-
 VMS commands and I/O statements from application programs. DEC OSMS
 supports all OpenVMS commands and their library routine equivalents,
 such as, but not limited to:

    INITIALIZE *
    MOUNT
    DISMOUNT
    ALLOCATE
    DEALLOCATE
    CREATE
    CREATE/DIRECTORY
    DIRECTORY
    COPY
    EDIT
    OPEN
    READ
    CLOSE
    DIFFERENCE

                                  2

 

    RENAME
    PURGE **
    DELETE **
    BACKUP
    WRITE
    APPEND

 *  This command can only be used once with WORM media.

 ** These commands can be used with WORM media but will not free up ad-
    ditional disk space as with rewritable media.

 System Management Functions

 An autochanger management utility (JBUTIL) is provided to allow the
 system manager to control the parameters affecting the operation of
 the autochanger. The utility also allows cartridges to be loaded into
 and removed from the autochanger. Once a cartridge has been placed in
 a storage slot inside the autochanger, it will remain associated with
 the corresponding JBxx: device destination until the cartridge is re-
 moved from the autochanger using JBUTIL.

 A utility (ODUTIL) is provided for analyzing and recovering lost files
 on WORM media (for VAX systems only). "ODUTIL" allows the user to:

 o  Recover files that have been "lost" on a WORMS-11 optical disk; that
    is, files that still exist on the disk but are not entered into any
    directory

 o  Display the number of allocated blocks in all files currently vis-
    ible (not deleted) on the disk volume

 o  Analyze and repair the file structure of a WORMS-11 optical disk
    by correcting the pointer that describes the next free block to use
    on the optical disk

 o  Recreate corrupted directories and restore the required files into
    the directory

 This functionality was previously provided in the "ODRECOVER" and "OD-
 ANALYZE" utilities.

 SUPPORTED HARWARE

 Following are the specific SCSI adapters and the optical libraries sup-
 ported by DEC OSMS Version 3.2.

 Other Hardware Required - Connectivity/Adapters:

 o  SCSI Interface: A SCSI interface (direct or via a supported adapter)
    is required for use of any of the supported autochangers. The fol-
    lowing list are the only adapters supported for use with this prod-
    uct.

       Q-bus Adapter: Digital's KZQSA Q-bus-to-SCSI adapter board is
       required for DEC OSMS to manage autochangers on Q-bus proces-
       sors.
       EISA-based SCSI Controller: The DEC 2000 Model 300 AXP system
       requires Digital's PB2HA-SA optional SCSI controller in order
       to connect more than two external SCSI devices to the system.
       This controller would therefore be necessary to connect opti-
       cal libraries requiring more than two SCSI IDs.




                                  7

 

       XMI-bus Adapter: Digital's KZMSA XMI-to-SCSI adapter board is
       required for DEC OSMS to manage autochangers on XMI-bus AXP pro-
       cessors. Note that this adapter is not supported on VAX proces-
       sors.

 In addition, it is important to understand that autochanger manufac-
 turers use differing approaches to their respective SCSI interfaces.
 Some manufacturers require one SCSI ID per optical drive in the au-
 tochanger, some manufacturers require one SCSI ID for an entire au-
 tochanger regardless of the number of drives.

 Digital's RW5xx autochanger family requires one SCSI ID for the au-
 tochanger plus one SCSI ID per optical drive. The RW5xx family uses
 the SCSI interface for all communications with the host processor.

 o  RS232 Interface: Some third party autochanger manufacturers use an
    RS232 interface for robotic command communications between the pro-
    cessor and the autochanger. With these autochangers, an RS232 se-
    rial port is required on the host processor. Digital's RW5xx au-
    tochanger family does not require an RS232 interface.

 Other Hardware Required - Supported Autochangers:

 For OpenVMS AXP processors, the DEC Optical Storage Management Soft-
 ware for OpenVMS supports the following specific 5.25-inch optical au-
 tochangers. Rewritable media only are currently supported by DEC OSMS
 for these autochangers.

 o  Digital RW524 and RW504: one 5.25-inch multifunction drive; 16 slots

 o  Digital RW530 and RW510: two 5.25-inch multifunction drives; 32 slots

 o  Digital RW534 and RW514: four 5.25-inch multifunction drives; 88
    slots

 o  Digital RW536 and RW516: four 5.25-inch multifunction drives; 144
    slots



                                  8

 

 For OpenVMS VAX processors, DEC OSMS supports the following specific
 5.25-inch and 12-inch optical autochangers. Rewritable (5.25-inch) and
 Write Once (WORM) (5.25-inch and 12-inch) media are supported by the
 software.

 Disk Space Requirements (1 Block = 512 Bytes)

 Disk space required for    15,000 blocks
 VAX installation:
                            (7.7 MB)
 Disk space required for    4,000 blocks
 VAX use:
                            (2 MB) *

 Disk space required for    15,000 blocks
 AXP installation:
                            (7.7 MB)
 Disk space required for    3,500 blocks
 AXP use:
                            (1.75 MB) *

                                  9

 

 These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. Ad-
 ditional disk space may be required based on the user's system envi-
 ronment and configuration, as well as the user options selected at in-
 stallation time.

 *  NOTE: With this release of DEC OSMS, caching is done on the basis
    of one cache file per optical storage volume. As a result, volume
    caching options selected at installation can result in disk require-
    ments ranging from 256 additional blocks (to cache one optical disk
    volume) to 9,216,000 additional blocks (maximum allowable cache for
    288 optical disk volumes).

 The minimum memory supported is 16 MB for VAX systems and 32 MB for
 AXP systems. The use of this software in conjunction with increased
 memory capability improves performance. The memory size suggested for
 most typical VAX hardware configurations is at least 32 MB.

 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

 o  OpenVMS VAX Operating System V5.5-2 - V6.1 for VAX systems.

 o  VAXcluster Software is required for cluster access to RW5xx libraries
    using rewritable media on VAX systems.

       NOTE: WORM media is not supported on VAXclusters at this time.
       AXP systems are not cluster supported at this time.

 o  OpenVMS AXP Operating System V1.5 - V6.1 for AXP systems except the
    DEC 2000/300.

 o  OpenVMS AXP Operating System V1.5H1 - V6.1 for the DEC 2000/300 sys-
    tem.
