   PRODUCT NAME:  DEC DB Integrator Gateway               SPD 63.35.00
                  for SequeLink[R], Version 3.1

   DESCRIPTION

   DEC DB Integrator Gateway for SequeLink (SequeLink Gateway) provides
   applications and tools with direct, read/write access to data sources
   served by Version 2.5 SequeLink servers. This access can be via in-
   teractive or dynamic SQL interfaces.

   Support for client/server access is provided by the SQL/Services server
   and ODBC drivers for Microsoft[R] Windows[TM] and Windows NT[TM] ap-
   plications. Optional support for embedded SQL and SQL module language
   programming is available.

   DEC DB Integrator (DBI) extends the functionality of the SequeLink Gate-
   way by providing a native integration of databases accessed by SequeLink
   Gateways and other DB Integrator gateways. DBI clients may directly
   access and join views of tables existing on multiple databases. These
   views may be horizontally or vertically partitioned and be based on
   tables existing on any database accessible by these gateways. DBI views
   may be pre-defined or dynamically declared.

   DBI servers maintain a persistent catalog of metadata extracted from
   databases served by SequeLink servers. DBI uses this metadata along
   with information on network and underlying database manager capabil-
   ities to optimize cross-database joins.

   The SequeLink Gateway is available on the DEC OSF/1[R] Operating Sys-
   tem on AXP systems, workstations and servers and on the OpenVMS Op-
   erating System on Digital AXP and VAX systems, workstations and servers.

   for SequeLink[R], Version 3.1


   Features

   Standard SQL Interfaces

   The SequeLink Gateway provides direct, read/write access to SequeLink
   data sources through standard DEC SQL interfaces. These interfaces in-
   clude a dynamic SQL interface, an interactive SQL facility and the 
   SQL/Services server.

   SQL data manipulation language (DML) is fully supported. SQL data def-
   inition language (DDL) support is limited to operations required to
   create and maintain tables and indexes and to grant and revoke access
   to database objects.

   The dynamic SQL interface compiles and executes SQL requests passed
   through its call interface. This programming approach is highly ef-
   fective in applications such as ad-hoc query access where the exact
   parameters of requests are not known until runtime. It is compatible
   with any programming language that supports the operating system's call-
   ing standards. The dynamic memory handling capabilities of Ada, C and
   PL/I enable these languages to take full advantage of the power and
   flexibility of this approach.

   The interactive SQL facility supports interactive query and update of
   data and management of table and view metadata in databases accessed
   via SequeLink servers. All required data format translations are per-
   formed automatically as part of handling requests to read and update
   data accessed by SequeLink servers.

   SequeLink Server Support

   The SequeLink Gateway provides access to information in INFORMIX-Online[R],
   INFORMIX-SE[R], ORACLE[R], IBM[R] DB2[TM] and IBM DB2/6000 databases
   through the SequeLink servers for those databases. Connectivity to a
   specific SequeLink server depends on the existence of a common net-
   work transport between the SequeLink server platform and the SequeLink
   Gateway platform.

   for SequeLink[R], Version 3.1

   Desktop Connectivity

   The SequeLink Gateway includes Microsoft Open Database Connectivity
   (ODBC) drivers for Microsoft Windows and Windows NT. These drivers en-
   able read/write access to databases via SequeLink servers over DECnet,
   TCP/IP and Novell[R] NetWare[R] (IPX/SPX) transports. Network trans-
   port alternatives depend on the selected desktop and SequeLink Gate-
   way platforms. [1]

   Performance

   The SequeLink Gateway selects access strategies that minimize data trans-
   fer activity. Wherever possible, selection, filtering, and statisti-
   cal operations are managed by the SequeLink server. A log of commu-
   nications activity and errors may be maintained to assist in problem
   isolation and evaluation.

   Data Dictionary Support

   The SQL INTEGRATE command updates CDD/Repository with definitions ex-
   tracted from databases accessed through SequeLink servers. The use of
   CDD/Repository with the SequeLink Gateway encourages consolidated main-
   tenance of data definitions in a repository where they can be shared
   by all applications, databases and programming tools that use them.
   [2]

   Optional SQL Support

   Support for interactive SQL and SQL application development is avail-
   able with the optional purchase of interactive and development licenses
   for DEC DB Integrator or DEC SQL.

   Optional Interactive SQL Support

   An interactive SQL license extends interactive SQL support to include
   DDL statements that create and maintain tables and indexes. It does
   not include support for all DDL statements.

   ____________________
 [1] ODBC client access via the Novell NetWare (IPX/SPX) transport is sup-
     ported only by SequeLink Gateways running on OpenVMS VAX platforms

 [2] CDD/Repository is not available on the DEC OSF/1 AXP Platform

   for SequeLink[R], Version 3.1

   Optional SQL Development Support

   The optional SQL development license provides precompiler support for
   embedded SQL applications, a compiler for SQL module language programs
   and application programming interfaces (APIs) to support the devel-
   opment of client/server applications.

   Optional SQL Compiler Support

   Embedded SQL programming places SQL language statements in line with
   host language statements. Precompilers replace these SQL statements
   with call statements and object modules. The modified host language
   program is compiled and linked with the object modules to form an ex-
   ecutable image.

   Refer to the DEC DB Integrator SPD (SPD 47.25.xx) for more detailed
   information on the language precompiler support available on each gate-
   way platform.

   The SQL module language compiler included with the development option
   allows SQL statements and multistatement procedures to be grouped into
   modules. When these modules are compiled, the resulting object mod-
   ules can be linked with objects created by any language compiler that
   supports the server operating system calling standards.

   These compiler and precompilers support the Federal Information Pro-
   cessing Standards (FIPS) flagger that allows the user to identify any
   SQL statements which are not in the current ANSI/ISO SQL standard. An
   exception flagger for the Multivendor Integration Architecture (MIA)
   standard is also provided.

   Optional Client API Support

   The optional development license also includes the SQL/Services and
   SQL Multimedia API libraries. These libraries may be used by client
   applications on MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows, Windows NT, Macintosh[R],
   ULTRIX, OpenVMS and DEC OSF/1 platforms to directly read and update
   data through SequeLink gateways. Refer to the DEC DB Integrator SPD
   (SPD 47.25.xx) for information on the clients, transports and language
   compilers supported by these APIs on SequeLink Gateway platforms.

   CONFORMANCE TO STANDARDS

   When used in conjunction with DEC DBI, the SequeLink gateway complies
   with the International Standard, ISO/IEC 9075:1992, and the American
   National Standard, ANSI X3.135-1992, Database Language SQL, Entry-Level
   specification and the Federal Information Processing Standard for Database
   Language SQL (FIPS SQL) as defined in FIPS PUB 127-2.

   The DEC ODBC Driver for MS Windows complies with the Microsoft Open
   Database Connectivity specification V2.0.
