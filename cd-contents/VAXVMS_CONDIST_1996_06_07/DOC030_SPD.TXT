   DESCRIPTION

   DECdocument is a product of Touch Technologies, Inc. and is licensed
   under Digital Equipment Corporation's Standard License Terms and Con-
   ditions.

   DECdocument is a style-based, batch-oriented, document composition sys-
   tem. It is designed to aid OpenVMS users in the production of single
   manuals, large documentation sets, or specifications, and it supports
   HTML, Bookreader, and hardcopy output. DECdocument runs on a wide range
   of Digital Equipment Corporation configurations, including VAXclus-
   ters. It can be used from any of Digital's standard terminals, and it
   can create files for hardcopy output to any Digital line printer or
   laser printer, Bookreader files for on-line viewing on a DECwindows
   workstation, and HTML files for viewing access on the World Wide Web.

   DECdocument provides a complete, high-end documentation product that
   automates the production of large, format-intensive, technical doc-
   umentation - from the first entry of written material to the final out-
   put of formatted hardcopy or on-line documentation. DECdocument is de-
   signed for use by members of the team of people who contribute to a
   technical document during its life cycle: engineers, writers, editors,
   or final production specialists. Facilities are provided to create,

   maintain, revise, format, and print complex technical documents ef-
   ficiently. This provides greater control over the entire documenta-
   tion process while reducing time-to-market and costs.


   Features

   HTML Output

   DECdocument includes the HTML device converter which produces HTML (Hy-
   perText Markup Language) files from SDML files. This new feature is
   easily invoked - one word in the DECdocument command line. Several SDML
   tags allow users to control HTML file size, content and on-line ap-
   pearance.

   DECdocument automatically optimizes HTML file sizes for fast trans-
   fer over the Internet. In addition, HTML file sizes can be controlled
   by users through a logical.

   DECdocument is very flexible and supports a wide variety of styles and
   output formats. This includes HTML, Bookreader and Help, for on-line
   documentation, and hardcopy output styles and formats, such as those
   meeting military specifications.

   Note: Support for HTML output is limited in V3.0 to the Software Ref-
   erence family of design types.

   Generic Markup Language

   DECdocument uses a device-independent generic markup language for en-
   tering source text and markup instructions into ASCII text files. Us-
   ing any OpenVMS editor, the writer creates a documentation source file,
   enters the text, and inserts markup commands (tags) that label the text
   elements. Text elements determine the structure of the document and
   refer to such things as headers, lists, or tables.

   The markup tags have no specific formatting information. DECdocument
   stores the formatting information in a separate file that is used when
   the documentation source file is processed.

   Markup tags enable the writer to include graphic files in the final
   output document. DECdocument supports Sixel graphic files for the LN03
   or LN03 PLUS printers and PostScript[R] graphic files for the LPS40
   or LN03R printers. PostScript graphic files must conform to the En-
   capsulated PostScript File Format published by Adobe[R] Systems In-
   corporated.

   The DEC Language-Sensitive Editor can be used in conjunction with DEC-
   document to simplify the creation of documentation source files and
   to debug the markup code interactively.

   Multiple Document Designs and Styles

   DECdocument supports a variety of document types and designs. The doc-
   ument type refers to the structure and text elements associated with
   a particular document, for example a user manual, military specifi-
   cation, or letter. A design denotes a variation in the style of a doc-
   ument type and refers to such elements as running heads, running feet,
   and the typefaces and sizes for titles, headings, and notes. DECdoc-
   ument provides document types and designs for:

   o  SOFTWARE - The SOFTWARE document type can be used for producing user
      manuals containing software-specific information. This document type
      provides many software-specific features such as: a set of tags to
      draw keypad diagrams, a set of tags to format system messages, and
      a structured set of tags (called templates) to document software
      commands, routines, and programming language statements. DECdoc-
      ument also provides a design for specifications, as well as designs
      that are similar to those that Digital uses to produce its own doc-
      umentation. In addition, the SOFTWARE.REFERENCE design can be used
      when creating HTML output.

   o  MILITARY SPECIFICATIONS - The MILSPEC document type can be used for
      producing military specifications according to military standards.
      It includes a front page with a title and subtitle, a two-column
      list of signatures, and a listing of information about the spec-
      ification.

      A design is provided to produce documents requiring security clas-
      sifications, numbering of figures and tables by section number, 20

                                    3

      heading levels, one- to four-line running titles, single-line run-
      ning feet, and the ability to use proportionally spaced fonts within
      code examples. This design is available in double-spaced format for
      draft documents.

   o  MANUALS - The MANUAL document type can be used for documenting chapter-
      oriented material such as a book. DECdocument provides designs for
      primer, guide, and reference manuals.

   o  OVERHEADS - The OVERHEADS document type lets the user produce over-
      head slides for transparencies or camera-ready masters for 35mm slides.
      This document type provides features specific to presentation slides,
      such as automatic numbering of slides, title, topic, running heads
      and feet, and the capability to control the size of text.

   o  LETTERS - The LETTER document type can be used for producing a per-
      sonal or business letter, or interoffice memos. The doctype includes
      markup tags for an inside and outside address, salutation, clos-
      ing, and enclosures.

   o  ARTICLES - The ARTICLE document type provides many tags specific
      to articles, such as author information, back notes, bibliography
      reference sections, and an acknowledgment section. The design is
      in two-column format in 8 1/2 inch x 11 inch page size.

   o  REPORTS - The REPORT document type provides features useful for pro-
      ducing chapter-oriented material (such as a book) or nonchapter-
      oriented material (such as a report or a study). It includes a front
      page with lines for signoff signatures, outlining tags, and the ca-
      pability to control numbered or unnumbered heads, running heads and
      running feet, and sequential or chapter-oriented page numbering.
      Designs are provided for two-column text and for text that uses the
      full page width.

   o  GENERAL - The GENERAL document type is another doctype that can be
      used to produce manuals and reference material. It is similar to
      the SOFTWARE.REFERENCE design, but with much less white space. The
      SOFTWARE tags can be used with this document type. Also, the GEN-
      ERAL doctype can be used when creating HTML output.

   o  ONLINE Doctypes - The on-line doctypes provide features to support
      the creation of on-line documentation to be viewed with the DECwin-
      dows Bookreader. DECdocument supports the BOOKREADER destination
      and includes the following on-line doctypes:

         MANUAL.ONLINE
         SOFTWARE.ONLINE
         MILSPEC.ONLINE

         Note: DECdocument offers the on-line MILSPEC doctype that emu-
         lates DoD standards on the Bookreader. This doctype is not a DoD
         standard, but only an on-line representation of the above stan-
         dards.

   Customizable Document Designs and Styles

   The system administrator or book designer can customize the document
   types and/or designs provided with DECdocument. Although the user can-
   not change the fundamental layout of most text elements, a variety of
   design parameters can be changed. These include:

   o  Parameters that control basic page dimensions

   o  Fonts for text elements

   o  Vertical spacing around text elements

   o  Rule thickness

   o  Default text for element identifiers

   In addition, the positioning of certain text elements, such as fig-
   ure captions, can be changed.

   Refer to the DECdocument documentation for a complete list of Digi-
   tal supported modifications to document types and designs.
