 Text Converters

 Alternate Format Syntax (AFS)

 The AFS enables the editing of the text in DDIF documents on character-
 cell terminals. The DDIF document contains the following:

 o  The text of the AFS document

 o  Nontext (such as graphics and scanned images) stored in other files

 o  Formatting information stored in a special file, called the com-
    panion file

 AFS documents contain text and markup. AFS documents use tags to de-
 note the start and end of each text segment.

 Digital Standard Runoff (DSR)

 The DSR converter supports Digital Standard Runoff Version 5.0 and later
 versions.

 Document Content Architecture/Revisable Format Text (DCA/RFT)

 Document Content Architecture (DCA) is the IBM® architecture for in-
 terchanging revisable documents.

 DCA/RFT was designed for two basic environments:

 o  An environment in which documents are distributed for text revi-
    sion

 o  An environment in which documents are distributed for format re-
    vision

 The main purpose of DCA/RFT is to specify the form and meaning of the
 content of a document in a way that can be interchanged among office
 systems.


                                  4

 


 DX

 The DX converter converts from DX to DDIF and from DDIF to DX. DX is
 Digital's wordprocessing format for ALL-IN-1.

 The DX converter supports ALL-IN-1.

 MacWrite

 Macwrite is a wordprocessing application that runs on the Apple® Mac-
 intosh systems.

 The MacWrite converter supports MacWrite II Version 1.1.


 Microsoft Rich Text Format (RTF)

 RTF is a Microsoft wordprocessing file format. It is used in the Mi-
 crosoft Word and Microsoft Works applications, and runs on Microsoft
 Windows and the Apple Macintosh systems.

 The RTF converter supports conversion of documents generated by Mi-
 crosoft Word for Microsoft Windows Version 1.1 or 2.0, or Microsoft
 Word for Macintosh Version 4.0.


 Microsoft Word for MS-DOS

 The Microsoft Word converter supports conversion of documents gener-
 ated by Microsoft Word Version 4.0, 5.0, or 5.5 for MS-DOS.

 Microsoft Word is a wordprocessing application that runs on MS-DOS,
 Microsoft Windows, and the Apple Macintosh systems.

 roff




                                  5

 

 The roff converter converts roff documents that use raw roff commands,
 or one of the standard macro packages: man, me, mm, ms, or mu to DDIF.

 Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)

 SGML is an International Standards Organization (ISO) markup language
 standard. This standard frees the markup language of system and pro-
 cessing dependencies.

 SGML is a standard means of describing a document in terms of its struc-
 ture rather than in terms of its appearance. SGML documents use markup
 to identify the logical elements that comprise a document's structure.

 NOTE: DECwrite can import SGML files only if the DECwrite document style
 file matches the SGML file Document Type Definition (DTD).


 WordPerfect for MS-DOS

 The WordPerfect converter supports conversion of documents generated
 by WordPerfect Version 5.0 or 5.1.

 WordPerfect is a wordprocessing application. The WordPerfect converter
 converts a WordPerfect Version 5.0 or 5.1 input file on MS-DOS 3.3 or
 higher. WPS-PLUS format (WPL)

 WPL is Digital's WPS-PLUS file format. In previous versions of the Con-
 verter Library the DX converter was used to convert WPS-PLUS documents
 to DDIF. Using the new WPL converter you can now convert WPS-PLUS doc-
 uments directly to DDIF.

 The WPL converter supports WPS-PLUS Version 3.1 or later.

 Table Converters

 ASCII Field




                                  6

 

 The ASCII field converter is similar to the ASCII tabular converter
 except that it contains formatting information. The field definitions
 file contains field definitions. A field definition is an ASCII record
 that contains information specifying how to interpret the input field
 data and how to encode it into the resulting data.

 The ASCII field converter reads an ASCII field file and an ASCII field
 definitions file and combines the information from both files into DTIF-
 formatted tables.

 ASCII Tabular

 ASCII tabular files are standard ASCII files in which the data is ar-
 ranged in tabular format. ASCII tabular files also contain special char-
 acters to delimit cells and rows, for example, "and". ASCII tabular
 files do not contain formula or formatting information.


 CALCGRD

 CALCGRD is a tabular file format for files produced and read by DE-
 Calc Version 3.0A and DECalc-PLUS Version 3.0A. The CALCGRD converter
 converts the values, formulae, and formatting information in a CAL-
 CGRD file to DTIF

 The CALCGRD converter does not convert DECalc files created earlier
 than Version 3.0A. If you want to convert a file created earlier than
 Version 3.0A, you must first load and save the file in DECalc Version
 3.0A or DECalc-PLUS Version 3.0A to update it to a Version 3.0A for-
 mat.

 The CALCGRD converter supports DECalc Version 4.0 and DECalc-PLUS Ver-
 sion 4.0.

 Data Interchange Format (DIF)





                                  7

 

 The DIF files are formatted according to the DIF Technical Specifi-
 cation and must contain only characters from the ASCII character set.
 The DIF cell values cannot exceed 32,767 characters.

 The DIF converter supports 20/20[TM] Version 2.4.

 A DIF file has two sections:

 o  Header section-contains descriptions of the file

 o  Data section-contains the cell values

 WK1

 Lotus 1-2-3 is a spreadsheet application developed by Lotus Develop-
 ment Corporation.

 The WK1 converter does not convert Lotus 1-2-3 files that were cre-
 ated with versions earlier than Version 2.0. If you want to convert
 a file created with versions earlier than Version 2.0, you must first
 load and save the file in Lotus 1-2-3 Version 2.0 to update it to a
 Version 2.0 format.

 The WK1 converter supports Lotus 1-2-3 Version 2.0 or Version 2.01 binary-
 encoded format.

 WK3

 Lotus 1-2-3 is a spreadsheet application developed by Lotus Develop-
 ment Corporation.

 The WK3 format reflects substantial changes included in Lotus 1-2-3
 Version 3. For example, three-dimensional spreadsheet capabilities,
 allowing multiple worksheets; close integration with business graph-
 ics and database management functions, including external data access.

 The WK3 converter supports Lotus 1-2-3 Version 3.0 binary-encoded for-
 mat.

 Graphics Converters

 Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM)

 CGM is an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) stan-
 dard that defines a file format for storing and retrieving picture in-
 formation. The file format consists of elements that can be used to
 describe pictures in a way that is compatible with different devices
 and applications.

 The CGM converter supports CGMview® Version 2.0, and Arts & Letters®
 Version 3.1.

 The Graphics Hardcopy Output Converter

 The Graphics Hardcopy Output Converter first scans the input file to
 identify graphic elements that can be converted. The converter iden-
 tifies and maps the elements to the appropriate GKS functions. The Graph-
 ics Hardcopy output converter supports two graphics output categories:
 raster and vector.

 The following table shows supported graphics protocols.

 The Graphics Hardcopy output converter can generate several kinds of
 final form output using a set of functions within the Graphical Ker-
 nel System (DEC GKS). This allows you to select a different final form
 by modifying the options file.

 GIF

 GIF is a PC based colour-image transfer protocol. GIF is designed to
 support image dimensions of up to 64,000 pixels, 256 colors out of a
 16-million-color palette, multiple images in a single file, rapid de-
 coding for online viewing, efficient compression, and hardware inde-
 pendence. The GIF format uses tag fields. Although most of the file
 information is stored in a positional header, the format then switches
 to a tag structure.

 The GIF converter supports the following record formats:

 o  Variable length record

 o  Stream

 o  Stream LF and stream CR

 o  Undefined

 The GIF converter also supports both sequential and interlaced GIF im-
 ages. In the interlaced image, the horizontal lines are stored out of
 order in such a way that the entire image is displayed on the screen
 after four passes through the image data.

 The GIF converter provides support for variation in the data block size
 when reading the GIF data blocks from the input GIF file. This vari-
 ation of one byte is permitted as some applications that produce GIF
 do not create GIF files with uniform block sizes.

 MacPaint




                                 10

 

 MacPaint is an image file format used by MacDraw. The file format has
 a binary rather than fixed file type and consists of a 128 byte header
 block and a MacPaint binary file containing a single scanline compressed
 image.

 This converter supports bitonal images only.

 When DDIF files are converted to MacPaint files, the Macbinary header's
 file name field is filled in with the input file name. DDIF files con-
 taining scanned images may be in a compressed or uncompressed format.

 The MacPaint converter supports MacPaint Version 2.0.

 PICT

 PICT is an image and graphical format used on the Macintosh, and sup-
 ports files from Claris® MacDraw. The PICT converter can convert ei-
 ther PICT I or PICT II files. The PICT converter must find a Macbi-
 nary header in the input file.

 The PICT converter supports MacDraw II Version 1.1.

 TIFF

 TIFF is a PC-based tagging scheme used for image data interchange. The
 structure of a TIFF file consists of a header block that points to one
 or more image file directories (IFDs). The IFDs contain image infor-
 mation as well as pointers to image data.

 The file type created by these converters is Sequential Organized. The
 record format is fixed.


 General Restrictions






                                 11

 

 The converters in the CDA Converter Library do not perform modality
 conversions such as converting a text file into an image or the re-
 verse.

 Converters that support compound formats, such as DDIF, do process the
 text, graphics, and images in the input data, but the output format
 specified by the user limits the conversion process. If the user takes
 a DDIF document and converts it to ASCII text, any non-text elements
 are lost because they cannot be represented in the ASCII format. How-
 ever, the AFS converters can be used to edit a compound document us-
 ing an ASCII editor. The text file produced by the AFS converter con-
 tains tag references to temporary files where the non-text data is stored
 until the document is re-converted by the AFS output converter to a
 compound format. The WPL and DX converters operate in a similar man-
 ner.
