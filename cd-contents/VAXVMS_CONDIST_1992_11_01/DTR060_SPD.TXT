 PRODUCT NAME:  VAX DATATRIEVE, Version 6.0             SPD 25.44.24

 DESCRIPTION

 VAX DATATRIEVE is a query and report system for the VMS Operating Sys-
 tem. It provides a uniform access method for data stored by RMS, VAX
 Rdb/VMS, and VAX DBMS files on VMS and data residing in certain IBM[R]
 mainframe databases accessed through VIDA for DB2[TM]. Using VAX DATATRIEVE,
 a novice or experienced user can retrieve or modify data without con-
 sidering the underlying storage method or physical location.

 Modes of Operation

 VAX DATATRIEVE presents information in several different formats. In-
 formation can be displayed using simple defaults or can be reported
 on through a more flexible report writer. Information can be displayed
 on a terminal or workstation, printed on a hard-copy device, or writ-
 ten to a file. Information can also be displayed with user-defined VAX FMS
 and VAX TDMS forms, as well as DECforms or presented graphically. Hard
 copy of the graphic display can be printed on a printer attached to
 the terminal. VAX DATATRIEVE also provides an efficient way to access
 information stored on other VAX or PDP-11 systems linked by DECnet.

 VAX DATATRIEVE can be used interactively to retrieve, modify, store,
 or delete data using a simple set of commands. Frequently used com-
 binations of commands can be stored as named procedures and invoked
 by name. Programs written in other VAX languages can call VAX DATATRIEVE,
 allowing them to be independent of underlying data storage methods and
 physical location.

 A DECwindows interface to VAX DATATRIEVE is provided. This allows the
 user to perform a subset of the DATATRIEVE functions using menu bars,
 scroll bars, pop-up menus, pull-down menus, and buttons.

 Data Dictionary

 VAX DATATRIEVE is dictionary driven. Data descriptions are stored in
 and retrieved from CDD/Repository for VMS. VAX DATATRIEVE includes com-
 mands to store, examine, modify, and delete definitions in the dic-
 tionary and can use definitions stored by other VAX-layered products,
 such as the VAX DBMS Data Definition Language (DDL) or VAX Rdb/VMS meta-
 data definitions.

 VAX DATATRIEVE includes full support for DMU format dictionaries. It
 includes support for record and domain definitions in CDO format dic-
 tionaries, including the ability to access shareable fields. Pieces
 tracking is also supported for these entities.

 Protection

 Protection is handled by the CDD/Repository for VMS. VAX DATATRIEVE
 can access data only through definitions in the CDD/Repository for VMS.
 Locking the definition prevents the user from accessing the data. Ac-
 cess control with the DMU can be based on name and login account, whereas
 with CDO access control is based on Access Control Lists. Additional
 control using the password or terminal class (local, remote, or dial-
 up) can be specified for DMU format dictionaries.

 Remote Data Access

 VAX DATATRIEVE provides access to data on remote VAX or PDP-11 sys-
 tems provided DATATRIEVE has been installed on the remote system. VAX DATATRIEVE
 uses the local data dictionary on the remote node and will divide pro-
 cessing between the host and the remote system to reduce the traffic
 over the communications link.

 For the Nonprogrammer

 VAX DATATRIEVE provides the novice user with a tutorial mode called
 GUIDE Mode.

 VAX DATATRIEVE offers ADT (Application Design Tool) for the more ex-
 perienced user who wants to define the user's data structures. ADT takes
 the user step-by-step through the definition of a domain based on an
 RMS data file.

 If VAX DATATRIEVE is used on the same information by experienced and
 novice users, the novice user can use the full power of the language
 by invoking procedures designed by the more experienced user.

 A Computer Based Instruction course designed for the Datatrieve be-
 ginner is bundled with V6.0. This course interactively takes the user
 through the steps required to design a Datatrieve application

 For the Programmer

 VAX DATATRIEVE is a highly structured language that provides automatic
 access optimization, data type conversion, and data validation. Loop-
 ing and control structures, such as IF THEN ELSE, BEGIN END, REPEAT,
 WHILE, CHOICE and FOR (each record) can be combined and nested to cre-
 ate complex, powerful commands.

 VAX DATATRIEVE responds to programming errors with clear, explicit er-
 ror messages. The user can issue an EDIT command to invoke a text ed-
 itor with an erroneous statement as input text, correct the mistake,
 and resubmit the command. This editor can be either EDT, TPU, or VAX
 Language-Sensitive Editor (LSE) and is controlled by a user logical
 name assignment.

 Data Definition

 VAX DATATRIEVE stores the fixed attributes of each record in the record
 definition. In addition to COBOL-like attributes, DATATRIEVE allows
 validation criteria, fields whose values are computed at run-time, miss-
 ing value expressions, and default values.

 VAX DATATRIEVE supports most data types used by VAX FORTRAN, VAX COBOL,
 VAX PL/1, VAX C, and VAX BASIC. VAX DATATRIEVE also supports Varying
 String and Segmented String data types in VAX Rdb/VMS databases.

 VIEWS

 A VIEW is an alternative description of data. It can be used to al-
 low a user access to a subset of the data items in a record. It can
 restrict a user by including only some of the data items in a record,
 or it can combine data items from several files. Information can be
 linked through common values (or set linkages in VAX DBMS) to produce

                                  3

 

 complex hierarchical structures. Using a predefined VIEW, a user can
 access and display data from several files at once with the same com-
 mands used on a single file. Data accessed through a VIEW can be printed
 and modified, but data cannot be stored or erased using a VIEW.

 Program Access

 VAX DATATRIEVE can be called from any language that supports the VMS
 calling standard. VAX DATATRIEVE automatically converts data from its
 storage format to the format expected by the program. All of the fea-
 tures of interactive VAX DATATRIEVE are available through the call in-
 terface and use the same syntax.

 Storage Methods

 VAX DATATRIEVE uses a single, consistent syntax to provide full ac-
 cess to information stored in VAX RMS sequential or indexed files (VAX RMS
 relative files are supported for queries only), VAX DBMS, and VAX Rdb/VMS
 databases. VAX DATATRIEVE can also provide read-only access to infor-
 mation stored in certain IBM mainframe databases through the use of
 VIDA for DB2 [TM], as well as ORACLE [TM] on VMS through RdbAccess.
 Data from all these sources can be combined into a single VIEW.

 If access to a VAX DBMS database involves explicit set walking or if
 records must be manually connected or disconnected from sets, the user
 can employ VAX DATATRIEVE language features that are specific to VAX DBMS
 access. However, if the user employs VIEWS or implicit set walking,
 VAX DATATRIEVE can access information in VAX DBMS databases using the
 same syntax used for data from an RMS file.

 Report Generation

 The VAX DATATRIEVE REPORT statement can produce simple formatted re-
 ports without formatting statements. It also allows the user to over-
 ride the default format when more complex reports are required. Re-
 ports can either be page-based, printable documents, or table-based
 formatted data that can be input by a spreadsheet.

 Column headers and, in page-based reports, page headers containing ti-
 tle, date, and page numbers are produced automatically. Simple state-
 ments (AT TOP, AT BOTTOM) create page headers and trailers for con-
 trol breaks, page breaks or a report summary. VAX DATATRIEVE provides
 all of its statistical functions and value expressions within the RE-
 PORT statement.

 Reports can be output in a variety of output formats: table reports
 are produced in DTIF format, and page-based reports in DDIF, Postscript
 and Text formats. Usage of DDIF and Postscript allows a variety of text
 attributes (size, font types, rendition) to be applied to any part of
 the report to obtain a boardroom-quality output. These attributes, and
 other printing characteristics such as page size and orientation, can
 be selected from VAX DATATRIEVE through simple statements without re-
 quiring the use of a graphical terminal. Simple character-cell based
 reports are also available, using the Text format. Using the CDA con-
 verter library, DTIF and DDIF reports can be converted to a variety
 of output formats, allowing interoperability with a number of popu-
 lar applications.

 Reports can be generated from data stored in VAX RMS files, VAX DBMS
 and VAX Rdb/VMS databases, certain IBM mainframe databases accessed
 through the use of VIDA for DB2 or DATATRIEVE VIEWS that combine any
 of these without any change in the syntax of the REPORT statement.

 Graphics

 VAX DATATRIEVE includes a number of predefined plots invoked with a
 single command that takes standard record selection expressions as ar-
 guments and creates bar, pie, line, and scattered point plots of the
 information selected. Plots can be displayed on Digital Equipment Cor-
 poration Graphics terminals such as the VT340 (refer to the OPTIONAL
 HARDWARE section for a list of specific supported terminals). Hard copy
 can be obtained from terminals by attaching a Digital device which sup-
 ports the SIXEL protocol (for example, LA50, LA75). For users with DECwin-
 dows, graphics can be displayed in DECterm windows.

 Compatibility


                                  5

 

 VAX DATATRIEVE is largely upward compatible from DATATRIEVE-11. A util-
 ity is provided with DATATRIEVE-11 to extract the contents of a DATATRIEVE-11
 dictionary in a format to be entered into CDD/Repository for VMS. Some
 syntactic and semantic differences do exist between DATATRIEVE-11 and
 VAX DATATRIEVE. Procedures copied with the EXTRACT utility can require
 modification.
