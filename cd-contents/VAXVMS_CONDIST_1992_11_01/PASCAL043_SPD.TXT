           PRODUCT NAME:  VAX Pascal, Version 4.3       SPD 25.11.32

           DESCRIPTION

           VAX Pascal is an implementation of the Pascal[*] language
           that accepts programs compatible with either level of the
           ISO specification for Programming languages - Pascal [ISO
           7185-1983(E)] as well as ANSI/IEEE 770X3.97-1983 (December,
           1983). VAX Pascal also meets the Federal Information Pro-
           cessing Standard Publication (FIPS-109) requirements by ac-
           cepting programs conforming to the ANSI standard. VAX Pascal
           also accepts many features from the Extended Pascal stan-
           dard (ANSI/IEEE 770X3.160-1989 and ISO 10206).

           The compiler has been validated for both levels of the ISO
           unextended Pascal standard and for conforming to FIPS-109.
           Containing extensions to the standards, VAX Pascal gener-
           ates optimized, sharable code that takes full advantage of
           the VAX hardware floating point and character instruction
           sets and the virtual memory capabilities of the VMS Oper-
           ating System. The language contains control statements, data
           types, and predeclared procedures and functions.

           Major Pascal Language Elements

           o  INTEGER, REAL, CHAR, BOOLEAN, enumerated, and subrange
              data types

           o  ARRAY, RECORD, SET, and FILE structured data types

           o  Schemata type denoting families of types
