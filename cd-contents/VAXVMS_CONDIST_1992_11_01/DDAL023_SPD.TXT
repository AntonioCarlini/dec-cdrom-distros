 PRODUCT NAME:  VAX Data Distributor, Version 2.3       SPD 27.76.06

 DESCRIPTION

 VAX Data Distributor manages the distribution of relational data. Op-
 erations called transfers define what data and data definitions are
 to be moved (the source) and where they are to be moved to (the tar-
 get). The target need not be on the same system as the source.

 Distributing data in this way has several benefits, particularly when
 the target is on a different system from the source:

 o  Users can query a database local to them rather than having to ac-
    cess a remote database. This provides faster and more regular ac-
    cess.

 o  Congestion on the source database is reduced as a result of the use
    of the target.

 Methods of Data Distribution

 There are three transfer types: extraction, extraction rollup, and repli-
 cation. For each type of transfer, the source can be all the table def-
 initions and data within the source database or databases, or a sub-
 set of those definitions and data.

 Extraction

 The source database can be a VAX Rdb/VMS database or one from another
 database management system, such as DB2[TM], accessed using one of Dig-
 ital's interoperability products, such as VIDA for DB2.

 The target can be a VAX Rdb/VMS database or a set of tables created
 by VAX Data Distributor in an existing VAX Rdb/VMS database. If it is
 a database, a new version is created every time the transfer executes.

 If it is a set of tables, the data in the tables are deleted and new
 data, from the source, are inserted every time the transfer executes.

 Users can update the target. However, their updates are not reflected
 in the new version of the target created when the transfer next ex-
 ecutes.

 Extraction Rollup

 The same range of source databases is available for extraction rollup
 as for extraction. However, an extraction rollup has more than one source
 database. The source databases can be of different types, for exam-
 ple, one VAX Rdb/VMS database and one DB2 database.

 The target must be a VAX Rdb/VMS database. A new version is created
 every time the transfer executes. As for extractions, it can be up-
 dated by users, but updates will not be reflected in the new database
 created when the transfer next executes.

 Replication

 The source database must be a VAX Rdb/VMS database.

 The target can be a VAX Rdb/VMS database or a set of tables created
 by VAX Data Distributor in an existing VAX Rdb/VMS database. The tar-
 get is created when the transfer first executes (is initialized). Sub-
 sequent executions of the transfer apply the updates that have been
 applied to the source since the last transfer to the target.

 Hence, the difference between replication and the other two styles of
 transfer is that replication makes the data at the target identical
 to that at the source by updating it rather than rebuilding it. How-
 ever, if necessary, the transfer can be reinitialized and, in this case,
 the target is rebuilt.

 Users must not update the target. However, if the target is a set of
 tables within an existing database, other tables in the database can
 be updated (unless they are the target of other replication transfers).

 Schedules

 For every transfer, a schedule can be defined, specifying when the trans-
 fer is to execute. The transfer can also be executed by the transfer
 definer at a time when it is not scheduled.

 Pre- and Post-Transfer Command Procedures

 A transfer can have associated with it DCL command procedures that ex-
 ecute before and/or after a transfer executes. Potential uses of such
 procedures include:

 o  Making the network between the source and target systems available.

 o  Notifying users by VAXmail that the transfer has completed and re-
    porting on completion status.

 o  Creating indexes on tables in the target database.

 Multiple Transfers

 A database can be the source for more than one transfer. For example,
 a VAX Rdb/VMS database could be the source for a replication of some
 tables, an extraction of some columns from other tables, and also one
 of the source databases for an extraction rollup including yet another
 subset of the data.

 Since the target of an extraction or replication can be a set of ta-
 bles in an existing database, such a database can be the target of more
 than one transfer. However, it cannot be the target of an extraction
 rollup, and no table within the database can be the target of more than
 one transfer.

 A database can be both a source and a target database. For example,
 a database may be the target of a replication transfer, and may also
 be the source of other replications.

 Centralized Storage of VAX Data Distributor Information

 Transfer and schedule definitions and the status of every transfer are
 consolidated in a VAX Rdb/VMS database known as the transfer database.
 This database services a VAX or a VAXcluster.

 The interactive SQL and RDO utilities of VAX Rdb/VMS include VAX Data
 Distributor statements, such as:

 o  CREATE TRANSFER, in which the source and target are specified. Spec-
    ification of the source includes selecting the tables, and the rows
    and columns of those tables, to be transferred.

 o  CREATE SCHEDULE, in which the frequency of execution is specified.

 o  SHOW TRANSFER, which displays the definition of the transfer and
    that of the associated schedule if there is one, and the status of
    the transfer, including the date and time at which it last executed.

 Security

 To create a transfer, it is necessary to have SELECT access to the source
 database and to the tables transferred. To create a replication, it
 is also necessary to have CREATETAB privilege on the source database.

 If the target database is created by VAX Data Distributor, it is cre-
 ated with the VAX Rdb/VMS default protection. If it is necessary to
 be more restrictive for an extraction or replication, the database can
 be created in advance and the target specified as tables within it.
 Tables are always created with the VAX Rdb/VMS default protection. This
 can be altered in a post-transfer DCL command procedure.

 The data in the transfer database are protected from direct access by
 users lacking the required privileges.

 Relationships with Other Products

 VAX Data Distributor requires VAX Rdb/VMS. It can be used with any one
 of the three VAX Rdb/VMS packaging options. Sites needing to tailor
 targets (for example, creating indexes) can use either the interac-
 tive SQL utility or the RDO utility, both of which are supplied with
 the Interactive and Full Development options of VAX Rdb/VMS.

 Since these utilities can perform operations on remote as well as lo-
 cal databases, the operations can be performed from another node on
 the network provided that the VAX Rdb/VMS Run-Time Only option is in-
 stalled on the target VAX.

 If CDD/Plus is present on the target system, data definitions from tar-
 get databases can be placed in the dictionary by using the INTEGRATE
 statement of the VAX Rdb/VMS SQL or RDO utility.

 In addition to VAX Rdb/VMS, source databases for extractions and ex-
 traction rollups can be databases accessed via VIDA for DB2 or DEC Rd-
 bAccess for ORACLE® on VMS, or RMS or VSAM files accessed by DEC Rd-
 bAccess for VAX RMS on VMS.

 Where to Install VAX Data Distributor

 It is not necessary to install VAX Data Distributor on every system
 involved in a transfer. It must be installed:

 o  On the source system of a replication.

 o  On either the source or the target system, or both, of an extrac-
    tion or extraction rollup.

 Limitations

 The syntax to specify a set of tables within an existing database as
 the target is not available in RDO, but is available in Interactive
 SQL.

 Since VAX Data Distributor uses a cluster-wide transfer database, only
 one version of VAX Data Distributor is allowed in a cluster.

 Record selection, conditional and value expressions available in a trans-
 fer definition are a subset of those supported by the source database
 management system.

 Indexes, constraints, triggers, collating sequences, and ACLs are not
 copied to target databases.

 VAX Data Distributor does not provide commit-time replication of changes.
 That is, updates to the source are transferred to the target when a
 replication transfer executes, not whenever an update transaction is
 committed on the source database.

 VAX Data Distributor does not support DEC SERdb for Security-Enhanced
 VMS, Digital's Rdb/VMS compliant database with B1 security restric-
 tions.
