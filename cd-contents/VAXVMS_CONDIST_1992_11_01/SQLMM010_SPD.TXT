 PRODUCT NAME:  SQL Multimedia for Rdb/VMS, Version 1.0 SPD 36.01.01

 DESCRIPTION

 SQL Multimedia for Rdb/VMS is an advanced software solution for ma-
 nipulating, storing, and retrieving multimedia objects from client ap-
 plications that work with VAX Rdb/VMS databases. Consisting of two prod-
 ucts, SQL Multimedia Development for Rdb/VMS and SQL Multimedia Run-
 time for Rdb/VMS, this solution offers a productive, cost effective,
 standard method for managing multimedia objects.

 SQL Multimedia Development for Rdb/VMS is a Network Application Sup-
 port (NAS) service consisting of software libraries of callable rou-
 tines that give SQL applications and SQL/Services client-based appli-
 cations the ability to insert and fetch multimedia data objects into
 and from VAX Rdb/VMS databases.

 SQL Multimedia Run-time for Rdb/VMS provides a run-time license that
 allows access to multimedia objects stored in VAX Rdb/VMS databases
 through the use of the SQL Multimedia software library. This license
 supports access through both SQL and SQL Services compatible inter-
 faces. By using SQL/Services, SQL Multimedia provides a powerful client
 /server environment that supports VAX Rdb/VMS as the database server
 and the VMS, ULTRIX for RISC, MS-DOS®, Microsoft® Windows[TM], and Mac-
 intosh® client environments.

 This product is intended to be used by software programmers who write
 application programs that will be used with a VAX Rdb/VMS database.
 With this product, software developers, including database applica-
 tion programmers, document management system designers, and database
 or computer-aided system engineering (CASE) tools developers, can use


                               DIGITAL                     June 1992

                                                         AE-PNK7B-TE

 

 any VAX Rdb/VMS database to store multimedia objects, as well as tra-
 ditional relational data types (numbers and characters). Tools devel-
 opers can also use SQL Multimedia to add multimedia object support to
 existing database and fourth-generation language tools, and to build
 new tools to support multimedia objects.

 To define the Rdb/VMS multimedia data types, programmers use standard
 data definition language (DDL) statements of the SQL-compatible in-
 terface to VAX Rdb/VMS. This allows definition of tables that contain
 COMPOUND DOCUMENT, IMAGE, TABLE, TEXT, and BLOB (Binary Large Object)
 class objects in VAX Rdb/VMS columns. Standard DDL statements enable
 database designers to map multimedia objects to separate VAX Rdb/VMS
 storage areas on different disks. Multimedia objects can be stored on
 WORM (write-once, read-many) optical disks in either a standalone drive
 or jukebox[1] configurations supported by VAX Rdb/VMS. Refer to the
 VAX Rdb/VMS Software Product Description, SPD 25.59.xx.

 By providing the ability to store the multimedia objects in the database,
 SQL Multimedia offers the following advantages:

 o  Data integrity

 o  Concurrent access

 o  Security

 o  Simplified data maintenance

 o  Transparent access to multiple storage devices

 o  Standard storage format for multimedia objects

 o  Shared data across applications

 Features

 ____________________
 A   jukebox is a device that consists of one or more racks that hold
   optical disks, one or more optical disk drives, and a robotic mech-

   anism that transfers disks between racks and a disk drive.

                                  2

 

 SQL Multimedia defines and operates on five different data object classes:

 o  COMPOUND DOCUMENT class in DDIF, the Digital document interchange
    format

 o  IMAGE class in DDIF/Image or DECimage ISL image frame format

 o  TABLE class in DTIF, the Digital table interchange format

 o  TEXT class in record delimited, 8-bit byte streams

 o  BLOB class in independent, application-defined format

 In addition to the preceding formats for the various object classes,
 users can also specify application-specific or user-defined formats
 for each object class. For example, if an application does not use DDIF
 images, the user can store the image as an IMAGE object and specify
 the format (for example, TIFF) for that image during the insert op-
 eration. An application can also fetch legacy data (segmented string
 data that was stored independently of SQL Multimedia) from the database.
 In such cases, the application must interpret the retrieved legacy ob-
 ject because SQL Multimedia will have no knowledge of its contents.

 SQL Multimedia provides the ability to add compound documents, image,
 table, text, and application-specific data objects to existing database
 applications, as well as to build them into new database applications.

 Multimedia objects to be inserted into and fetched from a database can
 be retrieved from or deposited to any one of the following locations
 that can act as either a source or a destination:

 o  An entire object in main memory

 o  An object buffered to main memory via data streams

 o  A file

 SQL Multimedia provides the following callable interfaces:

 o  SQL-compatible interface to the VAX Rdb/VMS database product

 o  SQL/Services-compatible interfaces from client platforms to the VAX
    Rdb/VMS database server

                                  3

 

 The SQL/Services compatible interface enables a user to access a mul-
 timedia database from the following distributed desktop client envi-
 ronment:

 -  VMS client environment on VAX hardware

 -  ULTRIX client environment on reduced instruction set computer (RISC)

 -  MS-DOS client environment on IBM®-compatible personal computers

 -  Microsoft Windows client environment on IBM-compatible personal com-
    puters

 -  MPW[TM] and THINK C client environments on Macintosh hardware

 Optionally, SQL Multimedia can facilitate desktop to jukebox integra-
 tion when used with the following hardware and software:

 o  A VAX Rdb/VMS Version 4.1 database

 o  An optical disk software interface[2]

 o  A supported client hardware and software environment

 o  A write-once, read-many (WORM) device, standalone or jukebox con-
    figuration

 SQL Multimedia, in conjunction with VAX Rdb/VMS, provides users with
 the following abilities:

 o  Define a table where one or more columns in the table contain a COM-
    POUND DOCUMENT, IMAGE, TABLE, TEXT, or BLOB class object that is
    mapped to the native SQL data type, LIST OF BYTE VARYING

 o  Insert and fetch objects defined by SQL Multimedia within the scope
    of a database transaction

 o  Fetch segmented string data that was stored independently of SQL
    Multimedia

 ____________________
 The   optical disk software interface must model write-once, read-many

   (WORM) devices as standard VMS magnetic disks on VAX hardware.

                                  4

 

 o  Compress and decompress image DDIF objects as part of the insert
    and fetch operations on VMS and ULTRIX clients[3]

 o  Generate and store multiple revisable forms of IMAGE class objects
    and permit individual renditions to be fetched

 o  Access a VAX Rdb/VMS database that contains these supported objects
    from distributed client environments, via SQL/Services
