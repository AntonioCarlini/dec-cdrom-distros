 Unlimited System Use (Traditional and Clusterwide) licenses.

 UAE provides two styles of User Interface:

 o  A graphical user interface on X-Windows Motif(R) workstations

 Using the UAE assignment screen, the system manager can easily per-
 form license management operations, such as:

 o  Adding users and products to the UAE database

 o  Displaying license and product information

 o  Registering and modifying license PAKs
