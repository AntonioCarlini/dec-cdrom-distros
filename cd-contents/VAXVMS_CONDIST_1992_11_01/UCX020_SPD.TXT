                                                         AE-ME49E-TE

 

 Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)

 SMTP is the DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) Inter-
 net protocol for mail transfer. It provides users with the capabil-
 ity of sending and receiving electronic mail to and from remote hosts.

 Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Agent

 SNMP is the default standard protocol for network management over TCP
 /IP. The SNMP agent communicates with network management entities such
 as DECmcc to provide information about network activity. The infor-
 mation that can be obtained includes number of packets transmitted,
 number of errors found, last connection opened, and last connection
 closed.

 Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) Support

 FDDI is an emerging ANSI standard for a network technology based on
 fiber optics. It specifies a 100 megabit per second transmission rate.
 DEC TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS allows VMS systems to take advantage
 of this technology by enabling TCP/IP communications with other hosts
 in these configurations:

 o  On the same FDDI network

 o  Over a FDDI/Ethernet bridge

 o  Over a router

 VMS hosts are also able to act as an Internet gateway between FDDI net-
 works and one or more Ethernets. The management of the FDDI controller
 is integrated with the DEC TCP/IP management interface.

 DEC TCP/IP Auxiliary Server (inetd)

 Inetd has become the default service dispatcher in UNIX systems since
 it was first provided by Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) 4.3. The
 DEC TCP/IP Auxiliary server (inetd) listens for incoming connection
 requests from remote hosts and starts process services. The presence
 of this functionality greatly simplifies the writing of applications
 and reduces the number of server processes on the system.

                                  2

 

 The DEC TCP/IP Auxiliary server also provides a service database and
 controls dynamic process creation in the same manner as the UNIX-based
 inetd.

 Berkeley R Commands (rlogin, rsh, and rexec)

 DEC TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS includes support for the UNIX remote
 login, remote shell, and remote execution services.

 File Conversion "On the Fly"

 To maximize interoperability between VMS and UNIX applications, DEC
 NFS provides a sequential "read on the fly" file conversion capabil-
 ity. For example, CAD application users will now be able to share and
 view design images without needing to do off-line file conversion.

 Enhanced DEC TCP/IP Management

 The DEC TCP/IP configuration procedure has been extended to support
 the configuration of SNMP and SMTP. In addition, the DEC TCP/IP man-
 agement environment has been enhanced to provide new parameters, new
 counters, new extensions to counters, and new management commands for
 monitoring the local host and the network.

 Enhanced Security and Network Access Control

 System managers can use new security features to control the acces-
 sibility of VMS systems by remote TCP/IP hosts.

 Remote Printing

 DEC TCP/IP Services allows users at VMS or UNIX client nodes to print
 files on printers attached to VMS or UNIX server nodes.

 Functional Components

 DEC TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS consists of three major functional com-
 ponents:

 o  Run-Time

 o  Applications

                                  3

 

 o  Network File System (NFS)

 Run-Time Component

 The Run-Time component, which is based on the 4.3 Berkeley Software
 Distribution, brings TCP/IP communications to VMS computer systems with
 the following TCP/IP protocols and features:

 o  Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

 o  Internet Protocol (IP)

 o  Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)

 o  Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

 o  User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

 o  Routing Information Protocol (RIP)

 o  Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) Resolver

 o  Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Agent

 o  Ethernet support

 o  FDDI support

 o  DEC TCP/IP Auxiliary server (inetd)

 o  DEC TCP/IP system management

 o  Security and network access control

 DEC TCP/IP Programming Tools

 The Run-Time component includes a suite of application development tools
 (DECrpc V1.1, C socket programming interface, and QIO programming in-
 terface).

 DECrpc V1.1

                                  4

 

 DECrpc V1.1 lets users take advantage of all the available computing
 cycles on the network. DECrpc is a port of the Hewlett-Packard® Net-
 work Computing Systems[TM], Version 1.5. It provides a set of tools
 for building multivendor, distributed applications. This lets program-
 mers distribute applications across multiple network nodes, taking ad-
 vantage of each system's capabilities and enhancing the network's over-
 all performance. DECrpc includes the following components:

 o  Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Run-Time Library

 o  Network Interface Definition Language (NIDL) Compiler

 o  A Location Broker

 DECrpc does not include other components of the Network Computing Ar-
 chitecture, such as the Concurrent Programming Support or the repli-
 cated Global Location Broker.

 RPC applications are written in a high-level language, NIDL, which in
 turn generates calls to the RPC run-time procedures. The stub files
 generated by the NIDL compiler are C source files. Digital has extended
 the RPC run-time library to provide support for a name service inde-
 pendent interface.

 DECrpc has been tested and found compatible with Hewlett-Packard's Net-
 work Computing Systems V1.5 product.

 C Socket Programming Interface

 When this product is used with the VMS operating system, C language
 applications can be written using the Berkeley socket programming in-
 terface.

 QIO Programming Interface

 The VMS programmer also has the choice of using the VMS/QIO program-
 ming interface to write applications that access the lower-level pro-
 tocols. Programmers can write networking applications in any VAX lan-
 guage using the standard VMS ASSIGN, DASSGN, and QIO system services.

 DEC TCP/IP System Management

 The DEC TCP/IP management environment provides DCL-style commands to
 control and monitor the DEC TCP/IP communication protocols and DEC NFS.
 Commands are provided to define hosts, startup and shutdown/monitor
 network interfaces, and control how/what workstation clients access
 files on the VMS system. The DEC TCP/IP configuration procedure has
 also been extended to support the configuration of SNMP and SMTP. In
 addition, the DEC TCP/IP management environment has been enhanced to
 provide new parameters, new counters, new extensions to counters, and
 new management commands for monitoring the local host and the network.

 Enhanced Security and Network Access Control

 System managers can use new security features to control the acces-
 sibility of VMS systems by remote TCP/IP hosts.

 Applications Component

 The Applications component includes the popular user-oriented proto-
 cols for file transfer, remote processing, remote printing, and mail.

 o  File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

 o  Telnet Protocol (Telnet)

 o  Berkeley R commands (rsh, rlogin, rexec)

 o  Remote printing

 o  Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)

 FTP

 FTP allows bi-directional file transfer sessions between the VMS server
 and the UNIX client. The FTP session allows the client to view the file
 system structure on the remote server.

 Telnet

 Telnet is the standard Internet Application Protocol for remote lo-
 gin. DEC TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS applications include the Telnet
 client and server.

                                  6

 

 Berkeley Remote Commands

 DEC TCP/IP Services applications include the popular UNIX remote lo-
 gin (rlogin), remote shell (rsh), and remote executive (rexec) ser-
 vices.

 The remote login client and server is an alternative to Telnet. It is
 ideal for establishing remote terminal sessions with remote UNIX sys-
 tems. It includes support for automatic terminal type and speed recog-
 nition as well as support for user-specified terminal type and speed.
 Like the Telnet server, the remote login server is optimized to pro-
 vide high I/O performance by becoming (upon startup) an integral part
 of the VMS terminal driver.

 The remote shell client allows VMS users to execute commands on re-
 mote hosts from within the local host user interface prompt. For au-
 thentication at the remote host, the remote shell client provides the
 choice between user-specified or current VMS process account infor-
 mation. Similarly, the remote shell and remote executive servers al-
 low users on remote hosts to execute DCL commands on the VMS host, if
 local VMS credentials allow them to do so.

 Remote Printing

 DEC TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS provides remote printing for OpenVMS
 and UNIX clients. Client nodes are nodes whose users can print files
 on printers attached to server nodes. Client and server nodes can be
 VMS nodes and UNIX nodes.

 UNIX server and client nodes must run the line printer spooler soft-
 ware (lpd) defined in Request For Comments (RFC) 1179. VMS server and
 client nodes must run DEC TCP/IP LPD software.

 For each client node queue there is a corresponding queue on the server
 node and an LPD symbiont process service. To print one or more files
 on a printer attached to a server node, the user at a VMS client node
 issues the DCL-style PRINT command specifying a local queue that maps
 to the desired queue on the server node. The user at a UNIX client node
 issues the lpr command.

 SMTP

 DEC TCP/IP Services supports SMTP, the Internet Application Protocol
 for mail. It provides users with the capability of sending and receiv-
 ing electronic mail to and from remote hosts.

 DEC NFS Component

 The DEC NFS component supports Network File System (NFS) V2.0 proto-
 col specifications. NFS is an Application layer protocol that provides
 clients with transparent access to remote file services. The DEC NFS
 implementation is unique in the industry in that it provides an NFS
 cluster alias failover capability as well as access to both a VMS and
 ULTRIX compatible file system. With these features, UNIX systems can
 share files between a VMS file system and an ULTRIX file system and
 more fully exploit the reliability of VAXcluster systems. DEC NFS does
 not support VMS clients.

 The DEC NFS server promotes data sharing among clients by providing
 a central data storage facility for VMS and UNIX files. The DEC NFS
 server provides two types of file access for UNIX clients:

 o  Client access to VMS files

 o  Client access to UNIX-compatible files

 Client Access to VMS Files

 UNIX clients can access VMS files stored in an RMS Stream_LF format
 on the server. Stream_LF files are analogous to the "byte" stream files
 common on UNIX systems. Clients can access other types of RMS files,
 such as ISAM files. However, the ISAM structure and file contents will
 be passed to the UNIX client in sequential bytes. A programmer would
 have to be aware of the specific ISAM structure to make use of the file
 contents on the UNIX client.

 Client access to the VMS file system is subject to standard VMS file
 conventions. These conventions include 8 levels of directory nesting,
 and file names with the following syntax:

                                  8

 

 

 File Name  File Type   File Version

 39 Char-   39 Char-    INTEGER
 acters     acters

 Permitted characters are A-Z, a-z, 0-9, underscore (_), hyphen (-),
 and dollar sign ($). All alphabetic characters are interpreted as up-
 percase characters. File name and type cannot begin with an underscore,
 hyphen, or dollar sign. Version numbers must be decimal numbers in the
 range 1 to 32767. You can refer to a version number in a relative man-
 ner by specifying a zero or a negative number. Specifying zero locates
 the most recent version of the file, and specifying -1 locates the next
 most recent version.

 Client Access to UNIX and UNIX-Compatible Files

 The UNIX-compatible file system on VMS provides clients with the same
 file system functionality as a UNIX server. To the remote client, the
 VMS NFS server looks like a large UNIX file cabinet. The UNIX files
 are accessed according to the rules of the UNIX File System (UFS). UFS
 supports 4.3 BSD Fast File System semantics, which are a superset of
 the SVID (System V[TM] Interface Definition) Issue 2, Volume 1, file
 system semantics. The UFS rules permit up to 255 levels of directory
 nesting and file names of 255 characters. The UNIX-compatible file sys-
 tem on VMS may also be accessed by applications executing on the VAX
 system.

 Automount

 The DEC NFS automount command transparently mounts and unmounts NFS
 file systems on an as-needed basis. It is useful for mounting file sys-
 tems and directories that are needed only occasionally.

 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

 Processor and/or hardware configurations as specified in the System
 Support Addendum (SSA 25.A4.04-x).
