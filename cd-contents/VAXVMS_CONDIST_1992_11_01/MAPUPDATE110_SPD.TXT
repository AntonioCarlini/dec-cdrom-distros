 PRODUCT NAME:  VAX DEC/MAP, Version 3.0A               SPD 27.66.04

 DESCRIPTION

 VAX DEC/MAP is a network communication product. It implements the Net-
 work through Application layers of the Open Systems Interconnection
 (OSI) reference model. When combined with prerequisite hardware, VAX
 DEC/MAP will interoperate with other systems supporting the Manufac-
 turing Automation Protocol (MAP) Version 3.0 specification.

 VAX DEC/MAP V3.0A is a VMS layered product.

 The MAP network architecture specifies the protocols and services for
 the Physical, Data link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation and
 Application layers.

 The Physical and Data link layers are implemented in the prerequisite
 hardware, which are a fully integrated communications options not re-
 quiring any additional or non-Digital hardware.

 VAX DEC/MAP V3.0A will connect Q-bus VAX processors to a MAP network
 using the same IEEE 802.4 token bus hardware (DTQNA) developed for VAX
 DEC/
 MAP V2.0. VAX DEC/MAP V3.0A will also connect VAX UNIBUS, BI-Bus, and
 Q-bus processors to IEEE 802.3 networks. (Ethernet is not supported.)

 VAX DEC/MAP V3.0A software implements the Network Layer through Ap-
 plications Layers, layers 3 through 7.

 VAX DEC/MAP V3.0A provides the network and transport layers through
 the use of either of the following options.

 Option 1. VAX OSI Transport Service (VOTS) V2.0 product which is pack-
 aged with this product.

                               DIGITAL                  January 1992

                                                         AE-JC15F-TE

 

 Option 2. DECnet-VAX Extensions (DECnet Phase V) which contains VOTS
 V3.0. DECnet-VAX Extensions is not packaged with this product.

 These options are selectable during the installation of MAPUPDATE 11
 which is packaged as part of this product.

 VAX DEC/MAP V3.0A also includes the session and presentation layers.

 The application layer of VAX DEC/MAP V3.0A provides file transfer, ac-
 cess, and management (FTAM - through the use of the VAX FTAM V1.1 prod-
 uct which is packaged with this product), an application programming
 interface (MAPI - ACSE/Presentation Services), Network Management, and
 directory services (MDS).

 MMFS is no longer part of the MAP specification and will not be in-
 cluded in this product. Manufacturing Message Specification (MMS) is
 not included in this product.

 The conformance of VAX DEC/MAP V3.0A software to OSI and MAP standards
 is specified in Appendix A of this SPD.

 Software Capabilities

 VAX DEC/MAP V3.0A allows the VAX it is running on to communicate via
 an IEEE 802.3 or IEEE 802.4 Local Area Network (LAN).

 The user of VAX DEC/MAP V3.0A is provided with several application in-
 terfaces for communicating with other systems on the network, and a
 network management facility for control of the local node.

 Network Management

 VAX DEC/MAP V3.0A Network Management is designed to provide local net-
 work management for the VAX DEC/MAP host. The VAX DEC/MAP V3.0A Net-
 work Management functions consist of management for layers 1 through
 7, directory services, tracing, logging, and local events. The user
 interface is a command line interface provided by the MAPCL program.

 VAX DEC/MAP V3.0A network management has the following functions:

 o  Commands to monitor and modify information within the databases.

                                  2

 

 o  Commands to control the VAX DEC/MAP host's local network capabil-
    ities, such as enable/disable transport and transport connection.

 o  Commands to create access control information, which can be used
    by VOTS to restrict access to transport users passively associated
    with Transport Service Access Points (TSAP).

 o  Local event logging mechanisms for Application, Presentation, Ses-
    sion, Transport, Network, Data Link, and Physical Layers, and also
    for Network Access Points (NAP) and Subnetwork Access Points (SNAP).

 o  A software loopback test at the Transport Layer that enables users
    to loop data from one VAX DEC/MAP host to another in the VAX DEC
    /MAP network. Also provides a verification test that can be used
    to show the operability of a VAX DEC/MAP host.

 o  Access to VAX DEC/MAP Directory Service (MDS) for the storage and
    management of directory objects.

 o  Tracing facilities for Presentation, Session, Transport, and Net-
    work Layer data units. There are two modes of trace operation: Real-
    time tracing (collecting and analyzing data directly) and Non-interactive
    tracing (collecting data and analyzing it later).

 o  A symbol substitution facility that allows the user to create, delete,
    use and review logical strings in place of longer or complex strings
    found in a command.

 o  A logfile facility that allows the user to create a network man-
    agement command file to store the journal of subsequent commands.
    Such logfiles are to be created such that they can subsequently be
    used as scripts as invoked by the DO command.

 VAX DEC/MAP Application Layer

 The VAX DEC/MAP Application Layer provides the user interface to the
 communication services provided by the MAP network. It consists of File
 Transfer, Access, and Management (FTAM), Association Control Service
 Elements (ACSE), and VAX DEC/MAP Directory Service (MDS) via the VAX
 DEC/MAP Application Programming Interface (MAPI).

 File Transfer, Access and Management (FTAM)

                                  3

 

 The VAX FTAM V1.1 product is packaged with VAX DEC/MAP V3.0A to pro-
 vide the ISO FTAM functions. VAX FTAM provides users the ability to
 perform file transfer and limited file management between a VMS sys-
 tem and any other vendor's system which supports a compatible version
 of FTAM. It supports FTAM access as both an 'Initiator' and 'Respon-
 der'. The initiator component allows users on the local system to re-
 quest file transfer to or from a file on a remote FTAM system. The re-
 sponder component allows a user or application on a remote FTAM sys-
 tem to access files on the local VMS system. The VAX FTAM V1.1 prod-
 uct conforms to the MAP version 3.0 specification of FTAM.

 The user accesses FTAM services through the DCL command line inter-
 face which supports basic OSI file transfer and limited management ca-
 pabilities. Utilities to support the APPEND, COPY, DELETE, DIRECTORY,
 RENAME functions are provided for FTAM files. These are implemented
 in a manner consistent with the standard VMS utilities. The "/APPLICATION_
 PROTOCOL=FTAM" qualifier must be used with the DCL commands to invoke
 FTAM as shown below:

    $ APPEND/APPLICATION_PROTOCOL=FTAM
    $ COPY/APPLICATION_PROTOCOL=FTAM
    $ DELETE/APPLICATION_PROTOCOL=FTAM
    $ DIRECTORY/APPLICATION_PROTOCOL=FTAM
    $ RENAME/APPLICATION_PROTOCOL=FTAM

 FTAM can access and transfer files containing both binary and ASCII
 data supporting FTAM-1, FTAM-2 and FTAM-3 document types. For FTAM-
 1 document types, the string significance parameter values supported
 are fixed, variable and none. For FTAM-2 document types, the string
 significance parameter value supported is none. For FTAM-3 document
 types, the string significance parameter values supported are fixed
 and none.

 VAX DEC/MAP Application Programming Interface (MAPI)

 The MAPI Applications Programming Interface is provided to give the
 user direct access to the communication interfaces of ISO ACSE (As-
 sociation Control Service Elements) and limited access to ISO Presen-
 tation. This is the primary interface used by customers to develop their

                                  4

 

 own applications on the VAX DEC/MAP V3.0A system. It replaces the CASE
 interface available in previous versions of VAX DEC/MAP.

 The interface provides for peer-to-peer communications between appli-
 cation processes running in MAP network systems. It allows for:

 o  Establishing an association with a peer application

 o  Accepting or Rejecting an association request

 o  Exchanging data with a peer application

 o  Releasing or Aborting an association

 Both synchronous and asynchronous calls are supported.

 VAX DEC/MAP Directory Services (MDS)

 The VAX DEC/MAP Directory Service (MDS) provides for the storage, ac-
 cess and management of directory objects. MDS implements a local di-
 rectory service and a Directory User Agent (DUA) so that directory func-
 tions are available both in a local context and when the VAX DEC/MAP
 system is part of a centralized or distributed directory configura-
 tion.

 Full functionality of MDS may be accessed via the MAPCL command-line
 interface. Additionally, the directory lookup (name-to-address res-
 olution) capability is also made available via a synchronous program-
 ming interface routine.

 DUA bootstrap information (addressing information about the available
 DSAs on the MAP network) is entered at installation time. However, this
 information may be updated at a later stage using MAPCL with the "pro-
 hibit remote" service option.

 Protocol Layers

 Association Control Service Element (ACSE)


                                  5

 

 The ACSE provides services for establishing and releasing application
 associations. These services are intended to be applicable to a wide
 range of application process communication requirements. ACSE services
 are accessed via the MAPI interface.

 Presentation

 The purpose of the Presentation layer is to negotiate transfer syn-
 taxes, and perform local syntax to transfer syntax conversion, for the
 exchanging of data. VAX DEC/MAP supports only the built-in and null
 syntax handlers; applications must perform their syntax conversion at
 the application level.

 The Presentation layer can be accessed via the MAPI interface.

 Session

 The Session layer supports an orderly dialog between presentation en-
 tities using full-duplex functionality, check-pointing and resynchro-
 nizing capabilities. The MAPI, FTAM, and MDS services make use of VAX
 DEC/MAP Session services. VAX DEC/MAP does not have an exposed Session-
 level programming interface.

 Transport and Network Layer Implementation using VOTS V2.0

 The VOTS implementation is comprised of the OSI Transport and Network
 layer. The Transport layer is the fourth layer in the OSI seven-layer
 Basic Reference Model. It provides reliable end-to-end transfer of data
 between cooperating applications on open systems. The upper layers use
 the services of VOTS and the VOTS Programming interface is available
 for direct user program access. Note that MAPI and FTAM services will
 not negotiate the use of Transport EXPEDITED data. It is only avail-
 able via applications written to the VOTS programming interface.

 The Network layer is the third layer in the seven-layer OSI Basic Ref-
 erence Model. The VOTS implementation includes the Internet Protocol




                                  6

 

 (ISO 8473). The INTERNET Protocol allows for communication between Trans-
 port layer entities on the same or different subnetworks. This imple-
 mentation only has the capabilities of an End System, that is, it can-
 not forward data received from another system; it can only send its
 own data units.

 The VAX DEC/MAP transport/internet implementation may be connected to
 one or more ISO 8802-3 (IEEE 802.3) local-area subnetworks. It may also
 be connected to an ISO 8802-4 (IEEE 802.4) local-area subnetwork and
 allows concurrent access to both types of subnetworks. Note that VAX
 DEC/MAP V3.0A does not support X.25 packet-switched subnetworks.

 Transport and Network Layer Implementation using DECnet-VAX Extensions
 (VOTS V3.0)

 Refer the DECnet-VAX Extensions Software Product Description (SPD 28.03.xx)
 for details.

 Data Link And Physical Layer:

 Implementation of these layers is provided by the requisite hardware
 supplied by Digital.

 VAX DEC/MAP V3.0A Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)

 The VAX DEC/MAP IVP performs a series of tests to verify the proper
 installation and functionality of the VOTS, FTAM and other VAX DEC/MAP
 components.

 The Transport IVP allows for setting up both local (LOOPBACK) and re-
 mote (to another VMS system running VAX DEC/MAP) Transport connections
 in order to test the configuration of the Transport implementation.

 The FTAM IVP exercises the
 COPY/APPLICATION_PROTOCOL=FTAM,
 RENAME/APPLICATION_PROTOCOL=FTAM,
 DELETE/APPLICATION_PROTOCOL=FTAM,
 and DIR/APPLICATION_PROTOCOL=FTAM
 commands on the local FTAM responder of the VAX DEC/MAP system.

                                  7

 

 The MAPI IVP conducts a series of associations, data transfers, and
 orderly releases in local loopback mode.

 The MAPCL IVP verifies access to various databases.

    1.11 Changes to Files Between FTAM Protocol Exchanges

    This section documents the circumstances, if any, where changes
    occur in a file's existence, contents, or attributes between
    accesses using the FTAM protocol. A file in the VMS real file-
    store is controlled by the VMS Record Management Services
    (RMS). Therefore, any VMS user possessing access to a file's
    storage account or privileges to write or delete a file can
    potentially alter the file.
 ___________________________________________________________________
 ___1.12_Unavailable_Changes_to_Files_by_FTAM_Protocol_Exchanges____

    This section documents the circumstances, if any, where mod-
    ifications by FTAM protocol exchanges to a file's contents or
    attributes are subsequently unavailable for use. Ideally, all
    FTAM-generated modifications on an RMS file occur, and sub-
    sequently will be available for use. Potentially, however, a
    problem such as power loss or a disk-drive failure can prevent
    modificiations on a target file.
 ___________________________________________________________________
 ___1.13_Support_for_Parameters_____________________________________

    This section documents what optional parameters are supported
    and the range of values for all supported parameters. This
    discussion defines parameter support as the ability of the
    initiator and/or responder to pass or accept values for a pa-
    rameter. Parameter support does not necessarily imply that
    the VAX FTAM responder support the corresponding attributes or
    functions.









                                 20

 


 ___________________________________________________________________

    Table 7 lists the supported protocol parameter(s) for each
    service. For each parameter, the table indicates whether sup-
    port is mandatory or optional. For each optional parameter,
    the table indicates whether the VAX FTAM implementation sup-
    ports the parameter for the request and/or the response service
    primitives. The table also summarizes the acceptable range of
    values for each supported parameter. Generally, the VAX FTAM
    minimum ranges, which are the same as for equivalent VMS data
    types, meet or exceed the minimum ranges specified in ISO 8571.
    Where only a specific value or a limited range of values is
    acceptable, the table lists the specific value or range.

    Support of a parameter on the request primitive means that the
    VAX FTAM initiator can pass on a value within the acceptable
    range. Support of a parameter on the response service primitive
    means that the VAX FTAM responder can return a value within the
    acceptable range. However, the ability to return a value does
    not necessarily imply support for the underlying attribute or
    function. For example, for the recovery mode parameter, the
    responder can return a value of zero, which indicates that
 ___recovery_mode_is_unsupported.___________________________________

    character sets for FTAM-PCI and for FADU structuring informa-
    tion.

    The private use attribute is unsupported.

 ___1.16_Diagnostic_Codes_Usage_____________________________________

    This section documents the diagnostic codes used. The VAX FTAM
    implementation uses the FTAM diagnostic codes defined in ISO
    8571-3, as restricted by the NBS agreements. The VAX FTAM
    implementation attempts to use specific rather than general
    diagnostic codes.

 ___1.1_Directory_Service_Overview__________________________________

    Implements a local directory service and a Directory User Agent
    (DUA) so that directory functions are available both in a local
    context and when the VAX DEC/MAP system is part of a central-
    ized or distributed directory configuration.

    The MDS DUA implements the Directory Access Protocol as spec-
    ified by the International Organization for Standardization
    (ISO) in standard 9594.

    This standard defines the abstract service between a DUA and
    the Directory. The DAP protocol is mapped onto the Associa-
    tion Control Service Element (ACSE) and the Remote Operations
    Service Element (ROSE).

    The DEC/MAP Directory Service does not provide a Directory
    System Agent (DSA) and the Directory System Protocol (DSP) is
    not implemented by MDS.
 ___________________________________________________________________
 ___1.2_Directory_Access_Protocol_(DAP)_____________________________

    The Directory Access Protocol is used to realize the Directory
    Abstract Service. MDS comprises the READ and MODIFY application
    service elements in addition to ACSE and ROSE. Use of these
    ASEs is specified by the Directory Access Application Context.

    Use of Underlying Services

    The ASEs that MDS supports are users of RO-INVOKE, RO-RESULT,
    RO-ERROR, RO-REJECT-U, and RO-REJECT-P services of ROSE. The
    MDS DUA operates in a synchronous manner reporting success or
    failure depending on whether the operation produced a result or
    an error.

    mode.
 ___________________________________________________________________
 ___1.3_Directory_Protocol_Abstract_Syntax__________________________

    Abstract Syntaxes

    The MDS ASEs share a single abstract syntax, the Directory
    Access Abstract Syntax defined as {joint-iso-ccitt (2) ds (5)
    abstract-syntax (9) id-as-directoryAccessAS (1)}. MDS requires
    that this abstract syntax be encoded according to ISO 8825
    ASN.1 Basic Encoding Rules.

    Directory Application Service Elements

    The READ ASE supports the abstract-operations of the Read Port
    of the Directory. The MDS DUA supports the invocation of the
    Read and Compare operations through the READ ASE.

    The MODIFY ASE supports the abstract operations available from
    the Modify Port of the Directory. The MDS DUA provides support
    for the invocation of the AddEntry, RemoveEntry, and ModifyEn-
    try operations.

    MDS does not provide support for the List and Search abstract
    operations available through the Search Port of the Directory.
    However, MDS does support list and search functionality on the
    local directory database.


    Directory Application Contexts





                                 41

 


 ___________________________________________________________________

    The MDS DUA uses the Directory Access Application Context de-
    fined as {joint-iso-ccitt (2) ds (5) applicationContext (3)
    id-ac-directoryAccessAC (1)}. This application context allows
    the MDS DUA to access the READ and MODIFY ASEs.

































                                 42

 


    Errors

    MDS provides support for the notification of the user of the
    directory service of the following abstract errors: Abandoned,
    AttributeError, NameError, Referral, SecurityError, ServiceEr-
    ror, UpdateError, DSAReferral, and AbandonFailed.
 ___________________________________________________________________
 ___1.4_Mapping_Onto_Used_Services__________________________________

    The MDS DUA maps the Abstract-Bind operation on the A-ASSOCIATE
    service of the ACSE in normal mode. The application context
    proposed is the Directory Access Application Context. The MDS
    DUA as the initiator of the association supplies the Presenta-
    tion Context Definition List which contains the ACSE abstract
    syntax ({2 2 1 0 1}) and the DAP abstract syntax ({2 5 9 1}).
    The A-ASSOCIATE specifies the use of the Kernel and Duplex
    functional units of the Session layer.

    The MDS DUA provides its Presentation Address and Applica-
    tion Entity Title (optionally) at association establishment
    time. The MDS defaults for the DUA calling address and calling
    application entity title are modifiable via MAPCL by the user.

    The Abstract-Unbind operation is mapped onto the A-RELEASE
    service of the ACSE.
 ___________________________________________________________________
 ___1.5_Supported_Object_Classes_and_Attributes_____________________

    MDS supports the DSA object class ({2 5 4 13}) and the Titled
    Application Entity object class ({1 3 9999 41 0 3}).









                                 43

 


 ___________________________________________________________________

    As per the MAP 3.0 specification, the Common Name, Object
    Class, and Presentation Address attributes are supported.
    Additionally, MDS provides support for the Country Name, Or-
    ganization Name, Organizational Unit Name, Application Process
    Title, Application Entity Qualifier, and Supported Application
    Context attributes.

    The sequence of the Country Name, Organization Name, Organi-
    zational Unit Name and Common Name form the MDS Application
    Simple Name of an application entity.

    Under the Titled Application Entity object class, supported
    attributes are Presentation Address, Common Name, Application
    Process Title (optional), and Application Entity Qualifier (op-
    tional). This is in accordance with the MAP 3.0 specification
    for the recommended object class.

    Under the DSA object class, supported attributes are Presen-
    tation Address, Common Name, and Supported Application Context
    (optional).
