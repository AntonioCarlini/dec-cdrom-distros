           PRODUCT NAME:  DEC InstantSQL for Rdb/VMS, Version 1.0 SPD
           37.60.00

           DESCRIPTION

           DEC InstantSQL for Rdb/VMS is a DECwindows Motif[TM] Graph-
           ical User Interface (GUI) for VAX Rdb/VMS that enables users
           to quickly compose and test complicated database queries with-
           out hand-coding complex SQL statements. Using DEC InstantSQL,
           users can graphically create queries, develop prototypes,
           or manipulate data and metadata without knowing SQL.

           When DEC InstantSQL is started, the main window appears on
           the screen. This window contains a pictorial view of the ta-
           bles and columns in the user's Rdb/VMS database. The top of
           the window contains a menu bar with pull-down menus list-
           ing the top-level items, such as File, Edit, Queries, Meta-
           data, Window and Help. By pointing-and-clicking, users can
           manipulate the data and metadata from the DECwindows inter-
           face.

           The results of the query may be viewed in a spreadsheet-style
           output window supporting horizontal and vertical scrolling,
           or saved in an ASCII text file. The SQL statement represent-
           ing the query is automatically generated, and can be dis-
           played and pasted into an application program.

           Features

           o  Supports read/write access to VAX Rdb/VMS
              databases.

           o  Builds queries graphically using pull-down menus and "point-
              and-click" mouse controls.

           o  Uses "direct manipulation" style of interface, allowing
              users to act directly on columns and tables in perform-

              commonly used commands.

              dow, which supports horizontal and vertical scrolling.
              Output can also be saved in an ASCII file.

           o  Generates and displays editable SQL statement represent-
              ing the query, which the user can cut and paste into an
              application program.

           o  Supports the following relational operations and constructs:

              -  SELECT

              -  Sorting (ORDER BY)

              -  Relational joins

              -  Query predicates (WHERE clause)
