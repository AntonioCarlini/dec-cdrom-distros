 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC Graphical Schema Editor for Rdb/VMS, Version 1.0 SPD
 41.23.00

 DESCRIPTION

 DEC Graphical Schema Editor (GSE) for Rdb/VMS V1.0 is an advanced tool
 for designing and editing Rdb/VMS schemas. Whether the users are database
 administrators, analysts, or designers, GSE helps them to quickly cre-
 ate, edit, and print both the logical and physical schemas, provid-
 ing a more intuitive and user- friendly approach to the SQL Database
 Definition Language (DDL) without compromising the power of SQL.

 GSE allows the user to graphically create, browse, delete, and mod-
 ify all Rdb schema elements including:

 o  Domains

 o  Columns

 o  Tables

 o  Views

 o  Constraints

 o  Triggers

 o  Protections

 o  Indexes

 o  Storage areas

 o  Storage maps

                               DIGITAL                     June 1992

                                                         AE-PRB2A-TE

 

 GSE provides complete support for the SQL DDL language with an SQL im-
 port parser and SQL export functionality. SQL DML for views and trig-
 gers is also fully supported. Use GSE to create new schemas, or doc-
 ument and modify existing schemas. The user can import existing schemas
 into GSE from an Rdb rootfile, Rdb SQL command file, or even SQL files
 generated by CASE tools.

 GSE stores the schemas in its underlying repository-the same repos-
 itory RdbExpert uses. RdbExpert can use GSE schemas as input into the
 physical database design process, and GSE can read and edit schemas
 generated by RdbExpert.

 Features

 o  Design Hierarchy - Provides a structure for organizing, document-
    ing, and experimenting with different logical and physical schemas
    with minimal duplication of data. RdbExpert uses the same design
    hierarchy.

 o  Consistency Checker - Validates the semantics of the schema and re-
    ports errors so that they can be fixed within the GSE before gen-
    erating SQL for the schema.

 o  Cross-Referencing Utility - Makes dependency management easy by list-
    ing the name and type of all objects that make use of a given schema
    object. For example, you can see which columns make use of a par-
    ticular domain, or find out which views, triggers, indexes, etc.,
    will have to be modified when you rename or delete a particular ta-
    ble.

 o  Physical Schema Report - An easy-to-read, tabular report describes
    the attributes and contents of each storage area, provides a list
    of indexes for each table including index type and columns as well
    as placement information. Use the report to document existing schemas
    before they are modified by GSE.

 o  Redesign Command Procedure - Automates the conversion of an exist-
    ing database to a new design format by unloading and reloading the
    data. This is particularly useful when reorganizing multi-file databases.

                                  2

 

 o  SQL Generation - Generates complete logical and/or physical schema
    DDL

 o  Persistent Storage - Saves all schemas in a design database. Rd-
    bExpert uses the same repository.

 o  Navigation - Lets the user work quickly with very large schemas by
    positioning the center focus of the window on a given schema ob-
    ject.

 o  Find - Lets the user locate a named schema object for manipulation.

 o  Uses a DECwindows Motif[R] environment for an efficient, easy to use,
    user interface from either a VAX workstation or DECwindows x-clients
    (e.g., PCs, x-windows terminals, Macintosh[R] computers). Provides
    full Help capabilities.

 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

 Processor and/or hardware configurations as specified in the System
 Support Addendum (SSA 41.23.00-x).

 When choosing hardware, take into consideration the size of the schema.
 The size of the machine effects how long it will take to load the schema
 from the design directory into the GSE window. For example, a schema
 with 50 tables takes 1.5 minutes on a 3100 to load the schema. A schema
 with over 500 tables may take 1 hour to load the schema on a 3100, or
 may take 10 minutes on a 6000 class machine.

 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

 For Workstations Running DECwindows Motif and VT1300 Terminals:

 o  VMS Operating System
    (and necessary components of VMS DECwindows Motif)

 o  VAX Rdb/VMS (Run-Time Option)



                                  3

 

 The Run-Time software is required for DEC Graphical Schema Editor for
 VMS to create and access its design repository. NOTE: The Interactive
 or Development license is required to implement the Graphical Schema
 Editor-generated design.

 Refer to the System Support Addendum (SSA 41.23.00-x) for availabil-
 ity and required versions of prerequisite/optional software and for
 information regarding components of VMS DECwindows.
