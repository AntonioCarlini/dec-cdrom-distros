 PRODUCT NAME:  BASEstar CIMfast for VMS, Version 1.1   SPD 36.31.01

 DESCRIPTION

 BASEstar CIMfast for VMS is an application enabler that provides the
 following benefits to BASEstar application developers:

 o  Reduced development time

 o  Reduced application complexity

 o  Enhanced software maintainability

 o  Rapid prototyping capability

 CIMfast allows even inexperienced BASEstar application developers to
 create BASEstar applications quickly.

 CIMfast provides a very high level event-driven language especially
 suited for describing highly asynchronous BASEstar interaction. This
 language, called the CIMfast Event Language (CEL), has the following
 features:

 o  Based on an Event/Action paradigm

 o  Can be integrated with existing BASEstar application code

 o  Can be customized by adding user-developed callback functions

 o  Supports the use of the Language-Sensitive Editor (DEC/LSE) for menu-
    driven program creation

                               DIGITAL                      May 1992

                                                         AE-PJ55B-TE

 

 The CIMfast Event Language allows the user to describe in very sim-
 ple terms what BASEstar Events will be reacted to. Example Events are:

 o  Data changes representing the current state of the shop floor

 o  A message is received from another BASEstar application

 o  A period of time expires

 For each Event, the user can specify a sequence of Actions to be taken
 when this Event occurs. Example Actions include:

 o  Start or stop a manufacturing device

 o  Write to or read from a manufacturing device's memory

 o  Send a message to another BASEstar application

 o  Call a user-written high-level language function

 The CIMfast Event Language provides a wide range of Events and Actions
 that support the typical interaction of an application with BASEstar.

 Development Option

 The BASEstar CIMfast Development option provides users with the ca-
 pability to develop CIMfast applications either using the CIMfast Event
 Language alone or together with a high level language. Also provided
 with the Development option:

 o  Language-Sensitive Editor (DEC/LSE) support for the CIMfast Event
    Language

 o  Extensive CIMfast Event Language and high level language source code
    examples

 o  All necessary high level language include files

 Run-Time Option

 The Run-Time option provides users with the capability to execute pre-
 viously developed CIMfast applications, but not to create new appli-
 cations.
