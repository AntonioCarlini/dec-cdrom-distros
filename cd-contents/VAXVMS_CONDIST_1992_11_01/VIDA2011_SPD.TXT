 PRODUCT NAME:  VIDA for DB2[TM], Version 1.1           SPD 25.E7.03
                (DEC RdbAccess for DB2)

 DESCRIPTION

 DEC RdbAccess is a family of database interoperability products that
 provide direct, transparent access from VAX Rdb/VMS applications to
 non-VAX Rdb/VMS databases and files. DEC RdbAccess servers are spe-
 cialized VAX Rdb/VMS runtime systems that can be accessed by most ap-
 plications and tools that work with VAX Rdb/VMS.

 VIDA for DB2, a member of the DEC RdbAccess product family, is a database
 interoperability product that permits access to IBM® DATABASE 2[TM]
 (DB2) databases resident on IBM mainframe systems. VIDA for DB2 (also
 known as DEC RdbAccess for DB2) provides direct, transparent, read-
 only access to DB2 databases residing on IBM MVS/XA[TM] or MVS/ESA[TM]
 systems from applications developed using products such as VAX RALLY,
 VAX DATATRIEVE, VAX TEAMDATA, and DECdecision. VIDA for DB2 also sup-
 ports access from the VAX Rdb/VMS utilities, including interactive SQL
 and RDO, from precompiled 3GL applications with embedded SQL or RDML,
 and from desktop applications using SQL/Services. VAX Data Distrib-
 utor can be used to extract data from DB2 and replicate the informa-
 tion across the network in VAX Rdb/VMS.

 VIDA for DB2 is engineered using a client/server architecture. It con-
 sists of two component products and uses Digital's DECnet/SNA inter-
 connect products. VIDA Client for DB2 (hereafter referred to as VIDA
 Client) is a VAX-resident product that accepts requests for DB2 data
 from VAX applications. VIDA Client converts the requests into DB2 SQL
 and passes the requests to the IBM-based component, VIDA Server for
 DB2 (hereafter referred to as VIDA Server). VIDA Client and VIDA Server
 communicate using a DECnet/SNA Gateway or VMS/SNA (hereafter referred
 to as a gateway) and the DECnet/SNA VMS APPC/LU6.2 Programming Inter-
 face (hereafter referred to as APPC/LU6.2 PI). VIDA Server submits each

 request to DB2 using the dynamic SQL interface. Data obtained from DB2
 is passed back to VIDA Client through the gateway, and VIDA Client re-
 turns the data to the requesting application. The application can use
 the accessed data as it would any locally accessed data. For example,
 the data can be stored in a VAX database or VAX RMS file, or it could
 be displayed on a screen or printed.

 VIDA Client runs under VMS on VAX, MicroVAX, VAXstation, and VAXserver
 systems. VIDA Server runs as a CICS transaction on IBM System/370 main-
 frame systems running the IBM MVS/XA or MVS/ESA Operating Systems.

 Features

 o  VIDA for DB2 provides direct database access to IBM-based DB2 ta-
    bles and views. The user application accesses DB2 data the same way
    it would access Rdb/VMS data.

 o  VIDA for DB2 does not require users to create a copy of the IBM database
    on a VAX system. Creating VAX-resident extracts of IBM data is a
    matter of user preference and convenience.

 o  Applications can be developed to retrieve data directly from the
    DB2 database. Data retrieved from the mainframe database can be dis-
    played at a user's terminal, printed, or copied to VAX Rdb/VMS and
    VAX DBMS databases or to VAX RMS files.

 o  VIDA for DB2 is integrated with the VAX Rdb/VMS runtime system. A
    user or programmer makes requests to DB2 using exactly the same com-
    mands as would be used to access VAX Rdb/VMS.

 o  VIDA for DB2 supports many of the same user interfaces that can be
    used with VAX Rdb/VMS.

 o  DB2 data can be accessed interactively using VAX Rdb/VMS interac-
    tive SQL or RDO.

 o  DB2 data can be extracted and stored in Rdb/VMS tables using VAX
    Data Distributor.


                                  2

 

 o  DB2 data can be accessed directly from third generation language
    (3GL) programs using embedded SQL, SQL module language, dynamic SQL,
    callable RDO, or Data Manipulation Language (DML). These data ac-
    cess sublanguages are the same sublanguages used to access VAX Rdb/VMS
    data tables and views. The VAX Rdb/VMS Development Option is re-
    quired to develop 3GL applications that use VIDA for DB2. VAX Rdb/VMS
    provides SQL precompiler support for languages such as Ada, C, COBOL,
    FORTRAN, and PL/I. VAX Rdb/VMS provides DML precompiler support for
    languages such as BASIC, C, COBOL, FORTRAN, and Pascal. SQL mod-
    ule language or callable RDO can be used with any language that sup-
    ports the VMS calling standard. Refer to the VAX Rdb/VMS Software
    Product Description (SPD 25.59.xx) for a complete description of
    programming language support.

 o  When VIDA for DB2 is used with VAX DATATRIEVE, users can generate
    DATATRIEVE queries and reports that include data from DB2 tables
    or views.

 o  When VIDA for DB2 is used with VAX TEAMDATA, end users can access
    DB2 data tables and views directly, join them with TEAMDATA tables,
    store the results in TEAMDATA folders, and so on, for use in de-
    cision support and other personal and departmental applications.

 o  When VIDA for DB2 is used with VAX RALLY, online applications can
    retrieve information directly from DB2 at application execution time.

 o  When a request is made for DB2 data, the VAX Rdb/VMS runtime sys-
    tem passes the request to VIDA Client. VIDA Client converts the re-
    quest into DB2 SQL and sends the request to VIDA Server on the tar-
    get IBM system. The request is sent through a gateway using the APPC
    /LU6.2 PI.

 o  VIDA Server accepts the SQL request from VIDA Client and submits
    it to DB2 using the dynamic SQL interface. The results of the re-
    quest are passed back through the gateway to VIDA Client.

 o  VIDA Client performs automatic EBCDIC/ASCII translation and passes
    the results to the calling program. EBCDIC/ASCII translation is per-
    formed using a default translation table. An alternate user-defined
    translation table can be used if the default is not appropriate.

                                  3

 

 o  VIDA Server runs as a CICS transaction. Sites can apply CICS tun-
    ing techniques to the VIDA Server CICS transaction just as they can
    to other CICS transactions.

 o  VIDA Server works in conjunction with existing security products
    in IBM environments, for example CA-ACF2[TM], RACF, and default CICS
    security. VIDA users require an IBM account and must be properly
    authorized within CICS and DB2 to access DB2 data.

 o  VIDA Server uses a view to retrieve metadata from the DB2 catalog.
    The view can be redirected at installation time to access user-defined
    data tables that contain catalog data. When a VMS user attaches to
    the DB2 database, the metadata is automatically passed to VIDA Client,
    which converts the definitions into Digital relational data def-
    initions.

 o  The Digital relational data definitions created by VIDA Client can
    be stored in CDD/Repository using RDO or SQL INTEGRATE commands.
    3GL programs can be compiled against data definitions in CDD/Repository.

 o  VIDA for DB2 uses Digital DECnet/SNA interconnect software and hard-
    ware, including the DECnet/SNA Gateways, VMS/SNA, and the DECnet
    /SNA VMS APPC/LU6.2 Programming Interface to make the VAX to IBM
    communications link.

 o  VIDA for DB2 uses LU6.2 communications protocols to achieve fast
    and efficient data transfer.

 o  A VIDA Client on one VMS system can provide DB2 data access to lo-
    cal or remote users in the same DECnet network provided that users
    on the remote systems have access to VAX Rdb/VMS remote data ac-
    cess capabilities.

 o  VIDA for DB2 provides a logging facility that can trace communi-
    cations activity, log errors, and help isolate problems.

 Limitations

 VIDA for DB2 provides read-only access.
