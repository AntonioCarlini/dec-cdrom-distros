 PRODUCT NAME:  InfoServer Software, Version 2.1        SPD 33.20.04

 DESCRIPTION

 InfoServer Software is the software component of a special-purpose hard-
 ware/software system that makes up an InfoServer Ethernet-based vir-
 tual disk server. This product supports locally attached SCSI remov-
 able CDROMs, SCSI disk drives, and SCSI tape drives.

 The server contains 4MB of memory (3MB of which is cache), either an
 internal RZ23L drive (121MB), an internal RZ24 (209MB), or an RZ24L
 (245MB) drive, and either one integral RRD42 CDROM drive or one in-
 tegral and one external RRD42 CDROM drive (600MB each).

 The InfoServer supports up to 100 concurrent clients. Supported clients
 are listed in Table 1 Client Support Matrix in this Software Product
 Description (SPD).

 Virtual disks, both physical disk media and sets of logical disk blocks,
 can be served to the network by the InfoServer. InfoServer is the server
 component in a client-server model. Client systems running the appro-
 priate client software can connect to virtual disks and tape devices
 served by the InfoServer, and use them as though they were locally at-
 tached devices. Together, the clients and servers form a LAN-based net-
 work in which server-based storage can be accessed from client sys-
 tems.

 InfoServer Software is factory-installed on the server hardware. The
 server boots when powered-on from the fixed internal disk, requiring
 little or no management for the default mode of operation.

 With the Tape Function Access option, clients can also share SCSI mag-
 netic tape devices attached to the InfoServer to perform remote backup
 and software distribution as if they were locally attached.

 Software protocols provide remote access to the server on the LAN. These
 protocols are Local Area Transport (LAT) for remote management, LAST-
 port and LASTport/Disk for virtual disk access, LASTport/Tape for SCSI
 tape access, and Maintenance Operations Protocol (MOP) for down-line
 loading.

 InfoServer operation across low-speed bridges is possible, however,
 the underlying LASTport protocol assumes a low rate of packet loss.
 Therefore, low-speed bridges may cause significant performance degra-
 dation. For this reason, operation of the InfoServer is supported only
 over 10 megabit bridges.

 Features

 Pre-installation of InfoServer Software with Simplified Updating

 The InfoServer Software is factory-installed on the internal RZ23L/RZ24
 /RZ24L disk. Installation of the InfoServer Software is not required.
 The server boots when powered-on. A simple server command is provided
 for updating the InfoServer Software from CDROM.

 Autoconfiguration

 The server autoconfigures memory and devices and automatically cre-
 ates service names for media present on the server.

 Local and Remote Management Capability

 The server can be managed by either a locally attached console (not
 supplied) or a remote Local Area Transport (LAT) terminal. Local and
 remote console capabilities include configuration management, diag-
 nostic information (built-in self-test and diagnostic messages) and
 server control.

 A local console is not required for the default mode of unattended op-
 eration, but may be helpful in diagnosing hardware or software prob-
 lems.

 Password Protected Management Interface

                                  2

 

 A password-protected management interface allows control and monitor-
 ing of server activity, with auto-prompting at any point in the com-
 mand sequence, command-line recall, and built-in help.

 Access Control

 Server Access Control

 Every InfoServer and its corresponding set of clients is a member of
 a single workgroup. A workgroup is a mechanism used by the InfoServer
 software to logically subdivide the InfoServer network. Client sys-
 tems and InfoServers must belong to the same workgroup for clients to
 access virtual disks on the InfoServer. Up to 1,024 workgroups can co-
 exist in a single LAN.

 Management Interface Access Control

 o  Password protection

 o  LAT group codes

 Device Access Control

 o  Password protection

 o  Concurrent usage quotas

 Multiple Read/Write Virtual Disks on a Single Physical Disk

 The InfoServer can serve read/write disk partitions. A partition is
 a logical subset of a read/write disk. A single disk can be subdivided
 into several partitions, each of which can be served to the network
 independently as a virtual disk. The access mode supports a single writer
 or multiple readers, but not both concurrently (to prevent acciden-
 tal corruption of data on the disk).

 Read/Write Data Back-Up

 Back-up operations can be performed locally via server commands or re-
 motely using client-specific utilities.

 InfoServer Tape Function for Remote Back-up


                                  4

 

 With the Tape Function Access option, customers can perform back-ups
 via SCSI magnetic tape devices on the InfoServer as if they were lo-
 cally attached. One client at a time can access the tape device. Once
 the client has completed the task and disconnects from the device, it
 becomes available to the other clients on the LAN. InfoServer Soft-
 ware, Version 2.0 introduced Tape Function Access for VMS clients run-
 ning Version 5.4, at a minimum. InfoServer Software, Version 2.1 makes
 the tape backup capabilities available to VMS users running previous
 versions of VMS, Version 5.0 - Version 5.3. With InfoServer Software,
 Version 2.0, Tape Function Access is available for VMS clients only.

 File System Independence

 InfoServer is a "virtual disk" or "virtual tape" server. InfoServer
 does not impose a file system on the virtual disks that it serves, in-
 stead the client system interprets the on-disk structure. Multiple on-
 disk structures can be served on a single InfoServer simultaneously.
 InfoServer is capable of automatically recognizing ODS-2, High Sierra,
 and ISO 9660 disk formats and creating service names which match the
 volume name. Other disk formats may be named manually through the In-
 foServer management interface.

 Automatic Failover to Duplicate Media

 Server protocols are designed to allow client systems to perform au-
 tomatic failover between duplicate media. The implementation of failover
 varies from client to client.

 Load Balancing

 InfoServer dynamically calculates a service rating for virtual disks
 based upon load. These ratings are used by some client systems when
 connections are requested. When the same disk is offered more than once
 on the network, load balancing is provided. This includes the abil-
 ity to load balance connections within a single InfoServer when du-
 plicate virtual disks are present, as well as between multiple InfoS-
 ervers with duplicate media on the network. Client systems will se-
 lect the highest rated service.

 Initial System Load

                                  5

 

 Some client systems implement Initial System Load (ISL) using a com-
 bination of server implemented down-line load and virtual disk capa-
 bilities. This feature eliminates the need for locally attached soft-
 ware distribution devices for initial system load on those client sys-
 tems.

 ISO 9660 Support for VMS

 InfoServer Software, Version 2.1 contains VMS savesets necessary to
 install support for reading ISO 9660 and High Sierra formatted com-
 pact discs. These savesets can be installed on any system running VMS,
 Version 5.5, at a minimum.

 InfoServer Monitor Utility

 The InfoServer monitor is a utility which runs on VMS systems. This
 utility monitors devices to ensure they remain available when events,
 such as the following, occur:

 o  A compact disc is replaced with a new disk or volume.

 o  Connection is broken between the VMS client and the InfoServer sys-
    tem.

 o  Data has been written to an InfoServer hard disk (disk must be re-
    mounted).

 Optional Functions Available to Increase InfoServer Capabilities

 InfoServer, Version 2.1 software enables installation of InfoServer
 functional upgrades from CDROMs. As new functions become available,
 customers can purchase separately and install each function they wish
 to make available on the LAN. For example, customers can add Tape Func-
 tion Access to their previously installed base packaged systems by pur-
 chasing and installing the Tape Function Access License and CDROM kit.
