 ____________________

 Formerly   known as VAXset package

 The   terms VMS and OpenVMS refer to the OpenVMS operating system.

                               DIGITAL                   August 1992

                                                         AE-HD68M-TE

 

 The Language-Sensitive Editor (LSE) is a multi-language programmer's
 editor. Language-specific templates and on-line language help assist
 both new and experienced programmers in developing programs faster.
 With LSE, users can efficiently edit, compile, review diagnostic in-
 formation from compilations, and correct compile time errors without
 exiting the editor. LSE also enables users to customize and extend their
 editing environment.

 Programmers can do low-level program designs with LSE by embedding pseu-
 docode in source code. Users can also view source code at various lev-
 els of detail by replacing a sequence of source lines with a single
 overview line.

 The following VAX compilers fully support LSE; the language templates
 are included with LSE:

 o  VAX Ada

 o  VAX BASIC

 o  VAX BLISS-32 Implementation Language

 o  VAX C

 o  VAX COBOL

 o  VAX FORTRAN

 o  VAX MACRO

 o  VAX Pascal

 o  VAX PL/I

 The following VAX compilers fully support LSE; the language templates
 are included with the VAX compiler:

 o  CDD/Repository for VMS
    (formerly known as VAX CDD/Plus)

 o  VAX DIBOL

 o  VAX DOCUMENT

 o  VAX Rdb/VMS

                                  2

 

 o  VAX SCAN

 o  VAXELN Pascal

 The following VAX products partially support LSE (refer to product SPDs
 for more details); the templates are included with the product.

 o  VAX ACMS

 o  VAX DATATRIEVE

 o  DECwindows UIL

 Note: Certain LSE features are not available when using language pre-
 processors, such as those supplied for VAX Rdb/VMS and VAX DBMS. Con-
 sult your local Digital representative for additional information.

 LSE works in concert with the Code Management System (CMS), the Source
 Code Analyzer, and the VAX Symbolic Debugger to provide a highly in-
 teractive on-line environment that facilitates the NAVIGATE-EDIT-COMPILE-
 DEBUG portion of the program development cycle. DECset users can di-
 rectly reserve and replace files from the Code Management System while
 in LSE, go to the exact source code location in LSE from the Source
 Code Analyzer (SCA), and go to the exact source code location in LSE
 from the VAX Symbolic Debugger.

 In addition to DECset for VMS licenses, licenses are also separately
 available for the DEC Language-Sensitive Editor/Source Code Analyzer.
 Please refer to the ORDERING INFORMATION section of this SPD.

 Source Code Analyzer

 The Source Code Analyzer (SCA) aids programmers in understanding the
 complexities of software systems. Since it allows users to analyze an
 entire system, as opposed to individual modules, and helps users un-
 derstand unfamiliar systems, SCA is extremely useful during both the
 implementation and maintenance phases of a project.



                                  3

 

 SCA provides navigation capabilities to assist users in locating and
 viewing components of their source code. SCA accomplishes this by stor-
 ing compiler-generated information about a set of source files in an
 SCA library. SCA then allows users to perform queries about their source
 code in the following ways:

 o  Using a name browser to locate all items that match a search string

 o  Specifying a cross-reference query to find how and where program
    symbols are used

 o  Specifying a call graph query to graphically display call relation-
    ships between routines

 o  Specifying a data structure query to graphically display the struc-
    ture of data types in the source code or to find symbols of a given
    type

 After users have a query result, they can use the go-to-source fea-
 ture to navigate to locations of interest in their source code.

 SCA also provides static analysis capabilities to assist users in check-
 ing for consistent use of program symbols.

 The following VAX compilers generate information to populate an SCA
 library:

 o  VAX Ada*

 o  VAX BASIC

 o  VAX BLISS-32 Implementation Language

 o  VAX C

 o  VAX COBOL

 o  VAX FORTRAN

 o  VAX MACRO (cross-referencing only)

 o  VAX Pascal

 o  VAX PL/I

                                  4

 

 o  VAX SCAN

 o  VAXELN Pascal

    *  Some versions of VAX Ada supply an SCA library that must be con-
       verted to SCA V4.0 format.

 Note: SCA is not available when using language preprocessors such as
 those supplied for VAX Rdb/VMS and VAX DBMS. Please consult your lo-
 cal Digital representative for additional information.

 The following VAX compilers also generate pseudocode and specialized
 comment processing information so SCA can produce design reports, cross-
 reference and analysis information:

 o  VAX Ada

 o  VAX BASIC

 o  VAX BLISS-32 Implementation Language

 o  VAX C

 o  VAX COBOL

 o  VAX FORTRAN

 o  VAX Pascal

 o  VAX PL/I

 In addition to DECset for VMS licenses, licenses are also separately
 available for the DEC Language-Sensitive Editor/Source Code Analyzer.
 Please refer to the ORDERING INFORMATION section of this SPD.

 DEC Test Manager

 The DEC Test Manager is a regression testing tool which automates the
 creation and maintenance of regression tests. It also automatically
 compares test run results with expected test results. The DEC Test Manager
 provides users with flexibility in organizing tests, selecting tests
 for execution, and verifying and reviewing test results. With the DEC
 Test Manager, users can:

                                  5

 

 o  Test batch, command line, and X Window System applications

 o  Test interactive applications which input and output text to char-
    acter cell terminals (DEC and ANSI CRT) with single display plane

 o  Create software tests

 o  Group tests into meaningful combinations

 o  Execute specific tests, groups of tests, or combinations of groups
    of tests

 o  Compare the results of the executed tests with benchmark test re-
    sults to determine differences

 o  View test results interactively

 o  Update benchmarks as needed

 o  Filter test results to ignore output which is expected to change
    for each run

 o  Mask certain screen areas when comparing executed test results from
    X Windows applications against benchmark test results

 The DEC Test Manager enables users to store software test descriptions
 and related files in Code Management System (CMS) libraries for stor-
 age efficiency.

 When used with CMS, all users of DEC Test Manager must be licensed for
 CMS use.

 In addition to DECset for VMS licenses, licenses are also separately
 available for the DEC Test Manager. Please refer to the ORDERING IN-
 FORMATION section of this SPD.

 Performance and Coverage Analyzer

 The Performance and Coverage Analyzer (PCA) helps users pinpoint ex-
 ecution bottlenecks in application programs. PCA can also identify which
 parts of an application are not executed by a given set of test data.

                                  6

 

 PCA has two components: the Collector, which gathers performance or
 test coverage data on the running user program; and the Analyzer, which
 later processes and displays the collected data. The Analyzer graph-
 ically presents information in three types of charts: histograms, ta-
 bles, and annotated source listings.

 PCA can gather and report on the following types of performance data:

 o  Ada multi-tasking data

 o  PC sampling data

 o  CPU sampling data

 o  Execution counts

 o  Test coverage

 o  Event markers

 o  Page fault data

 o  System service counts

 o  Input/Output statistics

 o  Vector PC sampling data

 o  Vector CPU sampling data

 o  Vector Execution counts

 Note: PCA does not analyze operating system performance or aid in hard-
 ware resource planning. Certain features of PCA are not available when
 using language preprocessors such as those supplied for VAX Rdb/VMS
 and VAX DBMS. Please consult your local Digital representative for ad-
 ditional information.

 With PCA, users can analyze applications written in any of the fol-
 lowing VMS languages:

 o  VAX Ada

 o  VAX BASIC

 o  VAX BLISS-32 Implementation Language

                                  7

 

 o  VAX C

 o  VAX COBOL

 o  VAX DIBOL

 o  VAX FORTRAN

 o  VAX FORTRAN High-Performance Option

 o  VAX Pascal

 o  VAX PL/I

 o  VAX SCAN

 Note: Not all PCA features are available to each of these languages.

 PCA works in concert with LSE and the DEC Test Manager. From the char-
 acter cell version of PCA, users can communicate with LSE and can ex-
 amine source code. When used with the DEC Test Manager, PCA can eval-
 uate the code coverage of a user's test system.

 In addition to DECset for VMS licenses, licenses are also separately
 available for the DEC Performance and Coverage Analyzer. Please re-
 fer to the ORDERING INFORMATION section of this SPD.

 Code Management System

 The Code Management System (CMS) provides an efficient method for stor-
 ing project files and tracking all changes to those files. Code man-
 agement is especially important to projects that have long lifespans
 or several versions of the software.

 CMS stores any kind of file, including documents, plans, specifica-
 tions, status reports, source code files, object files, executable im-
 ages, sixel files, or other records. CMS keeps these files in project
 libraries. CMS also stores history information. As a project evolves,
 CMS tracks changes to the library by storing only the changes made to
 a file. Not only does this reduce the amount of disk space used for
 storing multiple versions of files, but it allows CMS to reconstruct
 any previous version of a file and to identify the changes made be-
 tween any two versions. In addition to storing successive changes, CMS

                                  8

 

 maintains a record of who is currently working on a library element
 and a historical record of library access.

 With CMS, users can:

 o  Support multiple project libraries

 o  Retrieve previous file generations (same version)

 o  Delete, purge, or collapse generations

 o  Obtain a report of file modifications, including when, why, and by
    whom the modification was made

 o  Determine the origin of each line of a file, either as an annotated
    listing or as comments in the file

 o  Manage concurrent modifications

 o  Merge separately developed modifications

 o  Combine related files together as a "group"

 o  Relate the generation of one element to the corresponding gener-
    ations of other elements for purposes of freezing baselines or re-
    leases and for organizing ongoing development

 o  Interface via callable routines as well as through the CMS command
    line interface and the VMS DECwindows Motif interface

 o  Through the use of CMS access control lists, fine tune VMS secu-
    rity mechanisms applied to CMS libraries and provide a means of no-
    tification about library events

 CMS can act as a project's central repository, by storing and track-
 ing source code files, object code, documentation, and a variety of
 files generated by other VMS tools. CMS can store files for the Mod-
 ule Management System (MMS) and the DEC Test Manager. LSE and DEC Test
 Manager users can access CMS elements directly from within LSE and DEC
 Test Manager.

 In addition to DECset for VMS licenses, licenses are also separately
 available for the VAX DEC/Code Management System. Please refer to the
 ORDERING INFORMATION section of this SPD.

 Module Management System

 The Module Management System (MMS) automates and simplifies the build-
 ing of software applications, whether they are simple programs of only
 one or two files or complex programs consisting of many source files,
 message files, and documentation. MMS can optimize the build process
 by rebuilding only those components of a system that have changed since
 the system was last built. In this way, MMS eliminates the steps of
 recompiling and linking modules that have not changed. Once users cre-
 ate a description file containing the rules describing the relation-
 ships among the components of their application and the MMS commands
 to build the application, MMS can build both small and large systems
 with one command.

 Note: The ACS library manager subsystem in VAX Ada duplicates many of
 the MMS features.

 MMS can interact with CMS, access definitions in CDD/Repository, and
 access forms stored in libraries for DECforms.

 In addition to DECset for VMS licenses, licenses are also separately
 available for the VAX/DEC Module Management System. Please refer to
 the ORDERING INFORMATION section of this SPD.
