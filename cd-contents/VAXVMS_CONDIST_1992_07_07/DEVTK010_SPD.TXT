 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC3GL Implementation Toolkit for VMS, Version 1.0 SPD
 38.60.01

 DESCRIPTION

 DEC3GL Implementation Toolkit for VMS is comprised of DCL command pro-
 cedures, templates, and software that creates an effective develop-
 ment environment when coding traditional 3gl applications using DEC-
 set (Software Engineering Tools). The DEC3GL Implementation Toolkit
 for VMS addresses the following areas:

 o  Defines project standards by recommending specific coding and de-
    sign standards and tools for communicating the standards to devel-
    opers. Included in the DEC3GL Implementation Toolkit for VMS are
    code examples illustrating the recommended standard and customized
    language templates to aid in adherence to coding standards.

 o  The DEC3GL Implementation Toolkit for VMS creates a consistent de-
    velopment environment that increases programmer productivity and
    reduces the overall application development time. The DEC3GL Im-
    plementation Toolkit explains the options and tradeoffs for defin-
    ing the physical and logical development environment and the rec-
    ommended choices.

 DCL command procedures create a customizable environment for devel-
 opment, test, production, and maintenance areas. The environment is
 created at a project and programmer level. Some of the items automat-
 ically created either at the project or programmer level are:

 o  CDD/Plus directories

 o  VAX DEC/CMS, VAX DEC/Test Manager (DTM) , DEC Source Code Analyzer
    (SCA) Libraries

 o  VMS UIC-based and/or ACL-based file access security mechanism

                                                         AE-PPKKB-TE

 

 o  Project logicals and directories

 o  Defines project subcomponents

    Making development environment decision requires knowledge of VMS,
    the development products, and the DECset tools that are to be used
    during implementation.

 o  LSE customizations that are used to create a streamlined program-
    mer's workbench. These customizations include LSE command and key
    definitions, modifications to the language definitions, and TPU pro-
    cedures that assist developers to explore source code. The follow-
    ing templates are provided:

       COBOL/SQL procedures (.COB)
       C procedures (.C)
       SQL Module Language (.SQLMOD)
       COBOL procedures (.SCO)
       Record definitions (.CDO)
       Message definitions (.MSG)
       DECforms (.ifdl)

 o  Code Reviews are an important aspect for the development team. The
    DEC3GL Implementation Toolkit for VMS allows for code reviews and
    provides procedures to review code which is checked in. The reviewer
    can either accept or or reject the code. The code review feature
    is optional and can be implemented across a project for a partic-
    ular version.

 o  To maximize project team productivity and produce a quality appli-
    cation, it is important to define a build procedure that will con-
    sistently and efficiently build an application. The DEC3GL Imple-
    mentation Toolkit for VMS recommends build methods using VAX DEC
    /MMS and provides tools to automate application building.

    -  The MMS Description Generator generates MMS description files
       from source code. The following languages are supported:

          SQL Module Language
          VAX C
          VAX BASIC
          VAX Pascal

                                  2

 

          VAX COBOL
          VAX FORTRAN

    -  The BUILD command procedure is used to invoke the MMS Descrip-
       tion Generator and VAX DEC/MMS.

 o  In most organizations, applications are developed in one environ-
    ment and must to be tested in another isolated environment. The DEC3GL
    Implementation Toolkit for VMS provides procedures to facilitate
    the movement of source code from one application environment to an-
    other. Procedures are also provided to release and install runtime
    components for a production area.

 The DEC3GL Implementation Toolkit for VMS will also allow for multi-
 ple versions of code to be maintained in VAX DEC/CMS libraries, and
 provide for multiple application environments to be set up easily to
 separate code development from testing and/or production, and to al-
 low for code sharing among different applications.
