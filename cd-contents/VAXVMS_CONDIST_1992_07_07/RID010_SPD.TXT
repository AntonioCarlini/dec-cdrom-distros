 PRODUCT NAME:   DECinspect                             SPD 41.27.00
                 Intrusion Detector for VMS, Version 1.0

 DESCRIPTION

 DECinspect Intrusion Detector (DECinspect ID) for VMS is a security
 tool that constantly monitors suspicious or hostile activity and re-
 ports any activity to the security manager.

 DECinspect ID operates in real-time, processing security alarms from
 the VMS Audit Server as they occur and notifying the security manager
 via mail. Furthermore, DECinspect ID can be configured to take coun-
 termeasures against intruders without human intervention.

 Security managers can use DECinspect ID from within the DECinspect Com-
 pliance Manager (DECinspect CM) for VMS menu system or from the DCL
 command line.

 DECinspect ID does the following:

 o  Notifies security managers about critical security events occur-
    ring on a system, as detected by the VMS Audit Server. The follow-
    ing is a list of these events:

    -  UAF modifications

    -  Proxy modifications

    -  Rights list modifications

    -  Privileged image installations

    -  File access failures

    -  Login successes by hostile users

    -  Login failures

    -  Breakin events

 o  Mails summary or detailed reports about the security events. One
    or more security managers specified on the DECinspect ID security
    manager list receive the reports. Only some reports are sent at spec-
    ified intervals. Most are sent in real-time. The following is a list
    of reports sent in real-time:

    -  Notification of a change in the system time

    -  Full security reports of UAF, proxy, and rights operations

    -  Full security reports when audit alarms are modified.

    -  Notification of password modification by users (this is enabled
       by the RID SET REPORT/PASSWORD_SET DCL command).

    -  Monitored local users, remote users or remote nodes become ac-
       tive (these reports are sent when users/remote users/nodes to
       declared to be hostile through the menu interface or through the
       RID MONITOR DCL command).

       The following reports are not sent in real-time:

    -  Daily login failure summary.

    -  Full intrusion notification of Breakin, Install, and Mount alarm
       messages. Repeated triggering of the same alarm by the same user
       causes only one mail message over the period of hours given by
       the MAIL_INTERVAL value.

    -  Excessive account failure activity per day (this is the message
       sent when a user exceeds the total login failure threshold).

 o  Initiates countermeasures against hostile users.

       If countermeasures are enabled, DECinspect ID takes action to
       counteract the security event. For example, a suspected intruder
       process is deleted or a suspected account is disabled after an
       account exceeds a certain number of events.
       If countermeasures are not enabled, the security manager still
       receives notification of the events; however, no counteraction
       takes place. For example, the suspected account is not disabled.

       Some limited countermeasures are always performed to preserve
       the integrity of DECinspect ID itself. For example, if an unau-
       thorized user disables audit alarms, DECinspect ID re-enables
       alarms automatically. Also, DECinspect ID protects its own run-
       time parameter file and recreates it automatically if it is deleted.

 o  Allows security managers to issue commands to DECinspect ID to mon-
    itor any suspected user and remote login sources for a specified
    length of time. For example, this feature is used if a known lo-
    cal account is being used to penetrate a system and it is desired
    to identify the remote login source(s).

 o  Sends security event messages, known as alarm tokens, to a DECnet
    node running DECinspect Security Reporting Facility (DECinspect SRF)
    for VMS software. Upon receipt of the alarm token, DECinspect SRF
    notifies the DECinspect SRF administrator (via electronic mail) about
    the security event.

 Alarm tokens contain information about the node's security manager,
 target entity, source entity, failure type, and failure limit. Stor-
 ing the alarm tokens, gives the administrator access to current and
 historical information about security events occurring on one or more
 nodes across a network.
