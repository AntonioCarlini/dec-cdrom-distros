PRODUCT NAME:  DIGITAL PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS     SPD 41.47.07
               (NetWare)

DESCRIPTION

DIGITAL PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare[R]) is an OpenVMS lay-
ered application that provides the functions of a NetWare V3.x server
in a PC LAN environment. It is a member of the PATHWORKS family of prod-
ucts, which provides a framework for integrating personal computers
into an organization's total information system, allowing different
types of users to share information and network services across the
entire organization.

The PATHWORKS family includes PC LAN server products running on Open-
VMS, Digital UNIX[R], ULTRIX, SCO[TM] UNIX, and OS/2[R] platforms pro-
viding industry standard Network Operating System (NOS) services that
use Novell[R]'s NetWare, Microsoft[R]'s LAN Manager, and Apple[R]'s
AppleShare[R] protocols. The PATHWORKS family also includes client prod-
ucts providing both client software for these servers and enterprisewide
support capabilities such as wide area transports (DECnet and TCP/IP)
and applications such as Mail and Terminal Emulation, allowing DOS,
Windows[TM], Windows 95, Windows NT[TM], OS/2, and Macintosh[R] clients
to participate as full peers in a widely-distributed computing envi-
ronment.

Features - Overview

PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) adds a new dimension to general pur-
pose OpenVMS systems. In addition to providing traditional support for
business, scientific, and engineering applications, this product al-
lows OpenVMS systems to appear to NetWare clients as Novell-certified
NetWare servers.

The major features of PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) include:

o  Novell-certified file and print services using Novell's NetWare Core
   Protocol and the IPX/SPX transports.

o  Access to services provided by PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (Net-
   Ware) available to PATHWORKS and other NetWare clients (with ap-
   propriately licensed components, see License Management section for
   details).

o  Files are stored on the server in native OpenVMS format. This al-
   lows information stored by the PCs using PATHWORKS V1.0F for Open-
   VMS (NetWare) to be shared with traditional OpenVMS users. In par-
   ticular, this feature allows the sharing of information between all
   PATHWORKS clients, even if they are not using NetWare.

o  Printing support not only allows NetWare clients to use an Open-
   VMS system running PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) to act as
   a generic NetWare Print Server, but this support also allows in-
   teractive OpenVMS users to direct jobs to remote, native NetWare
   print servers by simply directing their print jobs to local Open-
   VMS print queues.

o  File and print services management using standard NetWare manage-
   ment utilities, such as FCONSOLE, PCONSOLE, and SYSCON. These func-
   tions, combined with other standard systems and network management
   utilities for OpenVMS, such as Remote System Management (RSM), pro-
   vide a powerful set of tools for total distributed systems manage-
   ment.

o  Either NetWare-only, or NetWare combined with OpenVMS security mod-
   els can be applied in this environment, providing greater flexi-
   bility and added security to your system.

                                 2

 

o  A mail server is provided that works in conjunction with the Open-
   VMS Mail utility and the PATHWORKS Mail client to provide clients
   with access to enterprisewide electronic mail over DECnet.

o  A DECnet tunnel-function for the IPX transport is provided. This
   function encapsulates IPX packets in DECnet packets, thereby al-
   lowing information sent over IPX to be transported anywhere within
   a DECnet network. This allows existing DECnet-based wide area net-
   works (WANs) to be used to transport IPX-based traffic from IPX lo-
   cal area networks (LANs) on one side of the WAN to another.

o  New Novell Virtual Terminal (NVT2) support is provided, employing
   SPX as the new underlying transport. NVT2 support provided for DOS
   clients allows IPX-based terminal emulation software to be used on
   a PC for direct, interactive connections to the OpenVMS systems where
   PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) is operating.

o  NetWare (file and print) Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
   are provided

o  The host-based SCONSOLE Utility provides systems managers and ad-
   ministrators with a single menu-driven tool to configure and ad-
   minister OpenVMS-specific functions such as starting and stopping
   the file server, the IPX/SPX transports, or the DECnet tunneling
   function for IPX.

o  License Management software, now capable of supporting PATHWORKS
   users of both NetWare and LAN Manager clients, provides the capa-
   bility to:

   a. Distribute PATHWORKS client-based licenses across a network

   b. Validate access by clients with PATHWORKS client-based licenses

   c. Support client access using server-based licenses validated through
      the local OpenVMS License Management Facility (LMF) database

Note that (a) and (b) above are accomplished in conjunction with PATH-
WORKS license management software for the client.

Feature Details

o  NetWare Volumes/File Services

PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) provides NetWare clients with
a remote file system that appears as a transparent extension of the
client system's local computing environment.

PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) services are based on Novell's
NCP (NetWare Core Protocol) protocols and have been certified by Nov-
ell as a fully compliant implementation of Portable NetWare, V3.01B.

There are three types of RMS file formats allowed and supported on each
volume:

      . Stream
      . Sequential Fixed Length Record (512 bytes/record)
      . Sequential Fixed Length Record of a specified record size (1
      to 32K bytes/record)

Included with PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) is a feature called
a hybrid user. This feature allows users who are both interactive Open-
VMS users and users of PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) to ac-
cess both their NetWare created information and their interactive Open-
VMS user directory while logged in as a NetWare user.

If you are identified as a hybrid user, a special volume called HOME
is created when you log in. HOME points to your login directory of your
OpenVMS account. You can map drives to this HOME volume and/or to di-
rectories below it. You have access rights to all files in that di-
rectory just as if you were logged in to your account on OpenVMS.

Multiple NetWare clients can concurrently access files stored on the
server's disk through the file access modes and byte-range locking sup-
port provided by the server as defined by Novell's NCP protocol.

Through the use of the VMS Lock Manager, OpenVMS and PC-based appli-
cations can control file access.

o  Print Services

                                 4

 

PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) software allows NetWare clients
to access printers also used by interactive OpenVMS users and other
PATHWORKS clients that may not be using NetWare. These printers can
be connected to the OpenVMS server, OpenVMS cluster, or LAT-supported
terminal servers in a LAN.

The system administrator assigns a service name, called a NetWare print
queue, to an OpenVMS print queue, and can define NetWare user access
to the print service. NetWare client software can redirect printer I/O
from a client printer port to a defined NetWare print queue.

The system administrator creates, on the host, the physical and generic
queues and defines forms for selected Digital and third-party print-
ers using standard OpenVMS commands. The administrator then uses the
PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) SCONSOLE utility to associate
NetWare print queues with OpenVMS print queues. Refer to the Optional
Hardware section for details.

Multiple NetWare print queues may be set up for the same printer. For
example, a landscape service and a portrait service may be created for
the same PrintServer 40 Plus printer. In addition, other printer queues
can be manually set to support additional Digital and third-party print-
ers that are not listed in the menus.

NetWare print queues and the NetWare print servers servicing those queues
may reside on different physical systems. Because PATHWORKS for Open-
VMS (NetWare) includes a NetWare-compliant PSERVER implementation, it
is compatible with all versions of Novell's print servers, including:

      . NetWare 3.X (PSERVER.NLM)
      . NetWare 2.X (PSERVER.VAP)
      . Dedicated DOS (PSERVER.EXE)
      . Network printers providing a NetWare compliant PSERVER imple-
      mentation
      . Router VAP
      . NetWare for UNIX print server daemons




                                 5

 

Note that compatibility with "NetWare for UNIX print server daemons"
means that PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) will interoperate with
any other Novell Certified implementation of NetWare for UNIX provided
by Digital or by other vendors.

Any type of NetWare print server is capable of servicing NetWare print
queues located on any NetWare file server. In order to service Net-
Ware print queues associated with remote NetWare file servers, a PATH-
WORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) print server must be configured to
attach to each NetWare file server associated with each NetWare print
queue that it will service.

Similarly, in order to be serviced by remote NetWare print servers,
a PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) print queue would need to be
configured to allow this access.

NetWare clients that are logged into a PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (Net-
Ware) file server can also access other NetWare print services avail-
able in the network, either by attaching directly to the associated
NetWare file server or using the PCONSOLE utility.

   Interactive OpenVMS users can also queue print jobs to remote Net-
   Ware print servers by simply queuing their to normal OpenVMS print
   queues that have been set up by PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (Net-
   Ware) to send print jobs to the desired remote NetWare print server.















                                 6

 

o  Server Management and Control

SCONSOLE, an OpenVMS Utility used in conjunction with standard Net-
Ware client utilities, provides the complete set of tools needed to
manage the PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) server.

SCONSOLE is used to manage OpenVMS-specific functions related to this
product. In particular, SCONSOLE is used to:

      . Start and stop the server, in its entirety or in part
      . Create, modify, and remove volumes
      . Associate NetWare print queues with OpenVMS print queues
      . Modify server security settings
      . Add and delete hybrid users
      . Configure and tune server components
      . Display server specific statistics and information

o  Network Connectivity

   -  IPX/SPX

The PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) software includes an Open-
VMS implementation of the two transport protocols used by Novell's na-
tive NetWare products:

         . IPX - Internetwork Packet Exchange
         . SPX - Sequenced Packet Exchange

IPX is delivered as a STREAMS driver in this product and is used for
all NetWare related client/server functions. The IPX protocol is trans-
mitted as datagram packets between source and destination.

SPX provides a layer above the IPX protocol that tracks IPX packets
to ensure that each packet is successfully received by its intended
destination.

   -  Novell Virtual Terminal (NVT2) Protocol

NVT2 support consists of server software and software that must be loaded
on each client.

                                 7

 

On the PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) server, an OpenVMS pro-
cess provides Virtual Terminal services over SPX (using IPX). Each NVT2
connection requires a corresponding SPX connection. Therefore, a max-
imum of 1,000 concurrent NVT2 connections can be supported.

The NVT2 software for DOS-based clients (TSR or VLM) redirects ter-
minal I/O through INT14 or INT6b interrupt modes, the interfaces used
by most terminal emulation applications. Note that the PATHWORKS V5.x
for DOS and Windows SETHOST terminal emulation application also uses
these interfaces.

   -  IPX Tunneling within DECnet

PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) includes a capability of con-
necting one or more NetWare LANs using a DECnet WAN. The tunnel driver
encapsulates IPX datagrams within DECnet packets transmitted across
the DECnet network to the tunnel partner and then de-encapsulates the
IPX datagram, routing it to its intended destination.

o  Performance-Enhancing XQP+ Services

PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) includes a special release of
the enhanced OpenVMS file system, known as XQP+ (eXtended QIO Proces-
sor Plus). XQP+ is integral to OpenVMS V6.1, or greater, and is sep-
arately installable on VAX/VMS V5.5-2 and OpenVMS VAX V6.0 systems. XQP+
provides improved concurrency using multi-threading, which results in
improved performance for file system operations.

o  Mail Services

The mail server component of PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) pro-
vides a service that is separate and distinct from the NetWare file
and print services. This mail server is based on the OpenVMS MAIL util-
ity and requires DECnet as its communications transport. It allows PATH-
WORKS users, using the client PATHWORKS Mail software, to send and re-
ceive electronic mail messages without having to log in to the Open-
VMS system as an interactive user.



                                 8

 

A mail account may be established on the OpenVMS server for each user.
Mail can be sent to this account by other PATHWORKS Mail users as well
as traditional users of OpenVMS mail software. The mail server then
routes messages to the appropriate client when the user logs onto the
server.

The PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) mail server provides the PATH-
WORKS user with folders, distribution lists, and delivery capabili-
ties. Also, notification of new messages occurs both in realtime (which
may be optionally disabled) and upon log in to a network MAIL session.

o  Installation and Configuration

PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) and PATHWORKS V5.0F for Open-
VMS (LAN Manager) software are now distributed together (though still
licensed separately_) in a single media and documentation kit. There
is a single installation procedure that is shared between the two prod-
ucts that provides for the installation of one or both server prod-
ucts in a single step on an OpenVMS system using the standard VMSIN-
STAL procedure. An Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) is also
included, which can be used to confirm that all server software has
been installed properly.

Digital recommends that a customer's first purchase of this software
product at each site include Digital installation service. This ser-
vice provides implementation support for customers installing PATH-
WORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) software and for the integration of
DOS workstations into the Digital network. Contact your local Digi-
tal representative for information on the service options available.

o  License Management

PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) offers several license manage-
ment capabilities related to both client-based and server-based li-
censes.

   -  Client-based License Management



                                 9

 

PATHWORKS client licenses are provided as Product Authorization Keys
(PAKs) for the OpenVMS or Digital UNIX License Management Facility (LMF).
These PAKs must be loaded into an LMF database, using standard LMF pro-
cedures, on an OpenVMS or Digital UNIX system that is acting as a PATH-
WORKS License Server [1]. A single copy of the PATHWORKS License Server
software can now provide and verify client-based licenses for clients
using NetWare and LAN Manager software. NetWare clients use the IPX
transport to communicate with a PATHWORKS License Server, while LAN
Manager clients use the DECnet, NetBEUI, or TCP/IP transports.

The PATHWORKS License Manager, which must execute on the same node as
the license server, provides a user interface that allows the system
manager to monitor client license usage. The PATHWORKS License Man-
ager is also used to pre-allocate licenses to specific groups of users
and to reclaim a license from a client.

The PATHWORKS License Registrar, which executes on the same system as
the file server, will "handshake" with clients requesting access to
PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) functions. Clients that can suc-
cessfully "handshake" with the server and produce a valid client-based
license will be allowed access to the services offered by the PATH-
WORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) server.

   -  Server-based License Management

The PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) server also allows client
access based on a local server-based license. If a client requesting
access to the server fails to produce a valid client-based license,
the PATHWORKS License Registrar software checks the local LMF database
for the availability of a PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) FPS
license. If one is available, and the number of concurrently-connected
clients allowed by the license has not been exceeded, the client will
be allowed access.

____________________
 Note  that, although the license server can be active only on a sin-
  gle node in a cluster, if that node goes down for any reason, the li-
  cense server will automatically activate itself on another node in

  the cluster that is still running PATHWORKS.

                                10

 

Note that PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) servers always allow
you to use both client-based and server-based licenses, simultaneously.
However, since clients that do have a valid client-based license are
already licensed to use the server software, they are never counted
against the fixed number of clients granted access by the server-based
FPS license.

Restrictions and Limitations

o  NetWare NLMs are not usable with a PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (Net-
   Ware) server. NetWare NLMs are typically applications or utilities
   written specifically for an Intel platform using NetWare 3.x or for
   an Intel platform using NetWare 4.x as the host operating system
   and are not easily portable to other environments.

o  Version 3.01B

PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) is an implementation of Portable
NetWare, V3.01B. As such, certain features currently available in Nov-
ell NetWare 3.x Intel-based servers are not included. Among these fea-
tures are:

   -  The PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) print server imple-
      mentation cannot be used in conjunction with DOS based clients
      configured with RPRINTER.EXE or network based printers that im-
      plement NetWare's RPRINT protocol.

   -  Burst mode technology, or "packet burst", is not supported

o  The DOS utilities specific to PC hardware devices such as CHKDSK,
   FDISK, DISKCOPY, DISKCOMP and FORMAT cannot be used with PATHWORKS
   server volumes.

o  Unsupported wire protocols include:

   -  Ethernet using IEEE 802.3 (SNAP) frame-type (used mainly by Mac-
      intosh systems)

   -  Arcnet

   -  Token Ring on VAX systems (Token Ring on Alpha systems is sup-
      ported)

o  The OpenVMS Spiralog file system is not supported.

o  Though Novell's raw 802.3 Ethernet frame-type is supported, because
   it does not conform to the IEEE specifications, some usage restric-
   tions will always apply. In particular, this frame-type should not
   be used on any OpenVMS using the DECnet-Plus protocol (the default

                                12

 

   for OpenVMS V7.1 and later). See product documentation for addi-
   tional information.

o  PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) is not supported with Open-
   VMS VAX, Version 6.0, or with OpenVMS AXP, Version 1.5.

o  The NetWare utility Salvage is not supported (incompatible with the
   OpenVMS file system).

o  PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) supports a maximum of

   -  250 simultaneous users per OpenVMS node (an inherent NetWare 3.x
      limitation).

   -  250 NetWare volumes.

   -  1,000 SPX connections (each NVT2 session uses an SPX connection).

o  Though NetWare volumes may be dynamically marked for addition or
   deletion, volumes are only added or deleted when the server is restarted.

Optional Hardware

DIGITAL Printers

All printers supported by the OpenVMS Operating System using print queues
are also supported by PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare).

Note that DIGITAL PostScript[R] printers require the use of DECprint
Supervisor (DCPS) for OpenVMS. DCPS software is included with the PATH-
WORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) media, but the use of the DCPS soft-
ware requires the purchase of an appropriate license.

Refer to SPD 44.15.xx for DCPS licensing information and for a com-
plete list of the DIGITAL and non-DIGITAL PostScript printers supported
by DCPS.

OPENVMS CLUSTER ENVIRONMENT

The PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) server provides for a com-
mon NetWare SYS volume across OpenVMS cluster members running the server.
This means that a single bindery and trustee database is maintained
clusterwide.

In addition, NetWare volumes can also be made available clusterwide.
A volume, defined via SCONSOLE on one cluster member running the server,
can also be configured so that it is available to all other cluster
servers. However, concurrent file sharing between servers running on
different cluster members is not supported.

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

Operating System Software

For Alpha Systems:

o  OpenVMS Alpha Operating System V6.1, V6.2, V7.0 and V7.1

For VAX Systems:

o  VAX/VMS Operating System V5.5-2

o  OpenVMS VAX Operating System V6.1, V6.2, V7.0, and V7.1

For minimum hardware requirements of the operating system refer to the
Software Product Descriptions for the OpenVMS VAX operating system (SPD
25.01.xx) and the OpenVMS AXP operating system (SPD 41.87.xx).

OpenVMS Tailoring

For use with VAX/VMS V5.5-2 systems, the following OpenVMS classes are
required for full functionality of this layered product:

   . OpenVMS Required Saveset
   . Network Support

                                18

 

   . System Programming Support
   . Secure User's Environment
   . OPTL - Miscellaneous Files

For more information on OpenVMS classes and tailoring, refer to the
OpenVMS VAX Operating System Software Product Description (SPD 25.01.xx).

Network Transport Software

o  DECnet Software

The DECnet network transport software is required by PATHWORKS V1.0F
for OpenVMS (NetWare):

   -  when acting as a MAIL server for PATHWORKS clients

   -  to optionally tunnel IPX packets between two OpenVMS systems us-
      ing this software

   -  when the PATHWORKS License Server is configured to service PATH-
      WORKS clients using LAN_Manager and DECnet

The license to use DECnet software is usually bundled with your sys-
tem, but may need to be purchased separately.

Note that because the DECnet/IPX tunnel is a DECnet Phase IV imple-
mentation, its use on systems with DECnet-Plus installed requires the
definition of network name synonyms.

o  TCP/IP Software

TCP/IP network transport software is only required by PATHWORKS V1.0F
for OpenVMS (NetWare) if the PATHWORKS License Server is configured
to service PATHWORKS clients using LAN_Manager and TCP/IP.

When TCP/IP software is used for this purpose, it must be purchased
separately. The following TCP/IP transports are known to work with the
PATHWORKS License Server:

      . TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS V4.1 from Digital Equipment Cor-
      poration
      . Multinet[TM] V3.5 rev A from TGV[R], Inc.
      . TCPware[R] for OpenVMS V5.0-4 from Process Software Corpora-
      tion[R]

                                19

 

      . PathWay V1.1 from The Wollongong Group, Inc.

Associated PATHWORKS Server Software

PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) and PATHWORKS V5.0F for Open-
VMS (LAN Manager) now share some components. As a result, certain com-
binations of PATHWORKS server software cannot be run on the same ma-
chine at the same time.

The following PATHWORKS server products can be run on the same sys-
tem as  PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare):

   PATHWORKS for VMS, V4.x[1]
   PATHWORKS V5.0 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager)[1]
   PATHWORKS V1.x for OpenVMS (Macintosh)

The following PATHWORKS server products cannot be run on the same sys-
tem as  PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare):

   PATHWORKS V1.0 for OpenVMS (NetWare)
   PATHWORKS V1.0E for OpenVMS (NetWare)
   PATHWORKS V5.0 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager)
   PATHWORKS V5.0A for OpenVMS (LAN Manager)
   PATHWORKS V5.0B for OpenVMS (LAN Manager)
   PATHWORKS V5.0C for OpenVMS (LAN Manager)
   PATHWORKS V5.0D for OpenVMS (LAN Manager)
   PATHWORKS V5.0E for OpenVMS (LAN Manager)

Note that if you attempt to install PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (Net-
Ware) on a system running any of the software listed above, you will
automatically be given the option to upgrade related components to a

Access licenses for a description of the specific rights granted, and
the Applicable Client-based Licenses section below for specific li-
cense names and ordering information.

2. Server-based licensing (PC Concurrent)

                                21

 

A PATHWORKS PC Concurrent license for this product permits its use on
a single supported platform and allows access by clients that do not
have a PATHWORKS client-based license.
