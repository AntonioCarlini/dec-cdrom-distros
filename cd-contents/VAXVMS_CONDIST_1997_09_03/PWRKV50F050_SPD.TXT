PRODUCT NAME:  DIGITAL PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS        SPD 30.50.21
               (LAN Manager)

DESCRIPTION

DIGITAL PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) is an OpenVMS layered
application that provides the functions of a Microsoft[R] LAN Manager
V2.2 server in a PC LAN environment with additional features. It is
a member of the PATHWORKS family of products, which provides a frame-
work for integrating personal computers into an organization's total
information system, allowing users to share information and network
services across the entire organization.

The PATHWORKS family includes PC LAN server products running on Open-
VMS, Digital UNIX, ULTRIX, SCO[TM] UNIX[R], and OS/2[R] platforms pro-
viding industry-standard Network Operating System (NOS) services that
utilize Novell[R]'s NetWare[TM], Microsoft[R]'s LAN Manager, and Ap-
ple[R]'s AppleShare[R] protocols. The PATHWORKS family also includes
client software for these servers, consisting of a multi-NOS manage-
ment interface called ManageWORKS, enterprisewide support capabili-
ties such as wide area transports (DECnet and TCP/IP), and applica-
tions such as Mail and Terminal Emulation, allowing DOS, Windows[TM],
Windows NT[R], Windows95, Windows for Workgroups, OS/2, and Macintosh[R]
clients to participate as full peers in a distributed computing en-
vironment.

Features


                                                          June 1997

PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS adds a new dimension to general purpose Open-
VMS systems. In addition to providing traditional support for busi-
ness, scientific, and engineering applications, this product allows
an OpenVMS system to appear to LAN Manager clients as a Microsoft LAN
Manager server. PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS is an implementation of industry-
standard Microsoft LAN Manager V2.2.

The major features of PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS are described below.

File Services

PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS provides LAN Manager-based clients with a re-
mote file system that appears as a transparent extension of the client
system's local computing environment.

PATHWORKS for OpenVMS file shares are based on Microsoft's LAN Man-
ager V2.2 SMB (Server Message Block) protocols.

Each file stored in a file service is stored as an OpenVMS file in RMS
format. Three types of RMS file/record formats are allowed and sup-
ported on each volume:

-  Sequential Stream

-  Sequential Fixed Length Record (512 bytes/record)

-  Sequential Undefined

Files stored in a file service are accessible to PC clients, OpenVMS
users, and to applications that can interpret the content and orga-
nization of the file as written by the client application.

Multiple LAN Manager clients can concurrently access files stored on
the server's disk through the file access modes and byte range lock-
ing support provided by the OpenVMS Operating System.

Print Services

PATHWORKS for OpenVMS software allows DOS, Windows, Windows NT, Win-
dows 95, OS/2, and OpenVMS users to share printers connected to Al-
pha, VAX, or VAXserver computers and to OpenVMS cluster systems, as
well as network-based printers such as LAT printers and Digital PrintServers.

                                 2

 

Print services are supported in local area and wide area network en-
vironments. PC clients can print files from the DOS, OS/2, Windows,
Windows95, and Windows NT operating systems as well as from PC appli-
cations.

Multiple print services may be defined for a single printer. For ex-
ample, separate services may be created for landscape-mode printing
and portrait-mode printing. Similarly, separate services may be cre-
ated for Digital mode and IBM[R] ProPrinter[R] mode printing for a sin-
gle LA75 printer.

PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS includes the DECprint Supervisor (DCPS) Open
product, which provides PostScript and DEC ANSI printing to selected
industry-standard PostScript printers.

Sharing of Network Resources By Heterogeneous Users

Services provided by PATHWORKS for OpenVMS are accessible to PATHWORKS
LAN Manager-based clients as well as to Microsoft LAN Manager clients.
All clients using the services of a PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS server
must be properly licensed. (See the Software Licensing section of this
SPD.) Files are stored on the server in native OpenVMS Record Manage-
ment Services (RMS) format. This allows information stored by the PCs
using PATHWORKS for OpenVMS to be shared with traditional OpenVMS users.
In addition, this feature allows information to be shared among all
PATHWORKS clients, including those not based on LAN Manager technol-
ogy. Concurrent file access by host applications or non-LAN Manager
clients is not supported.

Network Transport Support

PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS supports DECnet, DECnet-Plus, TCP/IP, and Net-
BEUI network transport software. One or multiple transport stacks can
work concurrently on the server.

The TCP/IP transport, which is sold as a separate product and avail-
able from various vendors, must include a PATHWORKS IP (PWIP) driver.



                                 3

 

NetBEUI transport software is included with the PATHWORKS V5 for Open-
VMS software. Using NetBEUI transport software, LAN Manager clients
can access the server in the local area network for file and print ser-
vices.

See the Software Requirements section of this SPD for information on
supported network transport software.

NetBIOS[TM] Interface Support

PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS supports the NetBIOS interface in DECnet, TCP
/IP, and NetBEUI networks. PATHWORKS for OpenVMS utilizes NetBIOS nam-
ing services and datagram services. A NetBIOS programming interface
is not provided, however. NetBIOS interface support includes the sup-
port of multiple transport stacks on a single or different network con-
trollers. NetBIOS support under TCP/IP includes a b-node RFC 1001/1002
implementation. This implies that the NetBIOS interface is supported
under TCP/IP in local area network environments only.

Flexible Security Models

The PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS security model accommodates both the LAN
Manager security model and the OpenVMS security model. The server may
be configured to use the security implementation best suited to the
environment. In "LAN Manager Only" mode, the LAN Manager security model
is enforced. In "LAN Manager and OpenVMS" mode, both the OpenVMS and
LAN Manager security models are enforced. In "LAN Manager and Creator"
mode, OpenVMS security is applied to files not created by users of the
PATHWORKS server.

Domain Support

PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS allows the network to be subdivided into ad-
ministrative groups of servers and clients called domains. A domain
is a group of servers and clients on a LAN and is the basic unit of
network administration. Each server running PATHWORKS for OpenVMS can
be a member of a single domain. A PATHWORKS for OpenVMS server can be
a Primary Domain Controller, Backup Domain Controller, Member Server,
or a Standalone Server, depending on the environment. Domains are a

                                 4

 

convenient mechanism for controlling user access to the network, and
for managing large networks.

PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS also provides support for wide area domains
using the LMHosts file. This file's presence on the PATHWORKS for Open-
VMS (LAN Manager) server allows NET Logons and UAS replication over
some wide area TCP/IP configurations. The LMHosts file contains a list
of nodes from geographically disperse sites that are synchronized by
the primary domain controller and accessible to clients in the server's
domain. However, use of the LMHosts file for replication over extreme
distances or in networks with slow transmission speeds is not recom-
mended.

Network Logon Services

The domain capabilities of LAN Manager make it possible for a user to
issue a single logon request in order to gain access to multiple servers
in a LAN. Running the netlogon service forces the validation of users'
logon requests. The logon server that processes the request checks its
copy of the domain-wide user accounts database for the user name and
password supplied in the logon request.

LAN Manager V2.2 API Support

PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS supports the LAN Manager V2.2 Application Pro-
gramming Interfaces, with the exception of Named Pipes and Mailslots.
Note that LAN Manager APIs are not available to OpenVMS host-based ap-
plications, but are available to PATHWORKS LAN Manager-based clients,
non-PATHWORKS LAN Manager clients, and OS/2 LAN Manager servers.

Remote Boot

The remote boot service included with PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS allows
DOS and Windows workstations to start up using information stored on
the server's hard disk instead of on their own local hard disks. The
PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS remote boot service is based on Microsoft's
LAN Manager remote boot service, which uses the Remote Program Load
(RPL) protocol. Remote boot is supported over NetBEUI on Ethernet net-
works. PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS supports MOP (Maintenance Operation
Protocol) as a secondary loader for clients without an RPL ROM.

                                 5

 

Mail Services

PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS includes a mail server component that allows
clients to send and receive electronic mail. The mail server is based
on the OpenVMS MAIL-11 product and requires DECnet as its communica-
tions transport. It allows users of PATHWORKS Mail client software to
send and receive electronic mail messages without having to log in to
the OpenVMS system as an interactive user.

A mail account may be established on the OpenVMS server for each user.
Mail can be sent to this account by other PATHWORKS Mail users as well
as traditional users of OpenVMS mail software. The mail server then
routes messages to the appropriate client when the user logs onto the
server.

The PATHWORKS for OpenVMS mail server provides the PATHWORKS user with
folders, distribution lists, and delivery capabilities. Realtime no-
tification of new messages can be optionally enabled by the client.
Time and Date Services

DOS, Windows, and OS/2 clients can request date and time information
from the server system and set the local workstation date and time to
coincide with them.

PATHWORKS FAT File System

PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS includes the PATHWORKS FAT file system, which
is an alternative to, and designed to coexist with the OpenVMS ODS-
2 file system. It is based on the DOS File Allocation Table (FAT) file
system. PC files stored in the FAT file system are stored in native
DOS format in a container file on the server system. Features of the
PATHWORKS FAT file system include:

-  support for multiple readers and writers of the container file

-  wide-area network access to files stored on the server in DOS for-
   mat

-  improved performance on file and directory operations over the Open-
   VMS ODS-2 file system

                                 6

 

The PATHWORKS FAT file system may be used as a migration path from ex-
isting PATHWORKS V4.x disk service container files (see Accommodation
of Retired Features).

Server Management and Control

PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS supports several server management interfaces:

-  ManageWORKS, a Windows-based utility supplied with the PATHWORKS
   V5 for DOS and Windows client product

-  A character cell utility called ADMINISTER/PATHWORKS

-  The LAN Manager NET ADMIN command line interface which may be ac-
   cessed from a terminal or terminal emulator, or from a LAN Manager
   client, including the PATHWORKS for DOS and Windows client.

The management utilities can be used to:

o  Manage file and printer shares, user accounts, and groups

o  Display and control server resources currently in use, such as ac-
   tive sessions, connections, services, and server statistics

o  View context-sensitive Help for each menu item and command















                                 7

 

PATHWORKS Monitor

The PATHWORKS Monitor utility is a Windows-based application provided
with the PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS server software. PATHWORKS Monitor
collects data on server resource utilization and provides a real-time
graphical display of this information.

PATHWORKS Configuration

The PATHWORKS Configuration utility is an OpenVMS-based application
that allows the user to modify the server's configuration. For exam-
ple, the user can configure the data cache size, the security mode,
the number of supported clients and more. Any adjustments that need
to be made to the OpenVMS SYSGEN parameters are automatically performed
by the Configuration utility.

Enhanced Cluster Support

PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS includes support for a transport-independent
PATHWORKS cluster alias name service that allows multiple cluster mem-
bers to appear as a single server to the connecting clients, provid-
ing higher availability. The PATHWORKS cluster alias name has a load-
balancing feature which connects clients to the cluster member that
is the least loaded at the time of the connection. PATHWORKS V5 for
OpenVMS also includes a high performance cluster-wide distributed data
cache that provides scalability in a clustered environment. VAX clus-
ters, Alpha clusters, and mixed-architecture clusters are supported
by PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS.

Enhanced Performance via XQP+

PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS includes a special release of the enhanced
OpenVMS file system, known as XQP+ (eXtended QIO Processor Plus). XQP+
is separately installable to OpenVMS VAX V5.5-2. XQP+ is included with
OpenVMS VAX and Alpha V6.1 and later. When PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS
detects the existence of the enhanced file system, it automatically
takes advantage of its improved concurrency, multi-threading, and di-
rectory caching features to provide better performance to file sys-
tem operations.

                                 8

 

Installation Utilities

PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS is installed on the OpenVMS system using the
standard VMSINSTAL procedure. An Installation Verification Procedure
(IVP) is also included, which can be used to confirm that the server
software has been installed properly.

The installation procedure allows you to install just the LAN Manager
server, just the NetWare server or both. It also allows you to install
just the PATHWORKS License Server.

Digital recommends that a customer's first purchase of this software
product at each site include Digital installation service. Contact your
local Digital representative for information on the service options
available.

























                                 9

 

Security

External authentication is an optional feature introduced in OpenVMS
Version 7.1 that enables OpenVMS systems to authenticate designated
users using their LAN Manager domain using a single username/password
combination. This feature is supported in PATHWORKS V5.0E and later.
For more information about external authentication for OpenVMS VAX,
see SPD 25.01.xx.

License Management

PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS offers several license management capabil-
ities related to both client-based and server-based licenses.

-  Client-based License Management

PATHWORKS client licenses are provided as Product Authorization Keys
(PAKs) for the OpenVMS or Digital UNIX License Management Facility (LMF).
These PAKs must be loaded into an LMF database, using standard LMF pro-
cedures, on an OpenVMS or Digital UNIX system that is acting as a PATH-
WORKS License Server. [1] A single copy of the PATHWORKS License Server
software provides and verifies client-based licenses for clients us-
ing either NetWare or LAN Manager software. NetWare clients use the
IPX transport to communicate with a PATHWORKS License Server, while
LAN Manager clients use the DECnet, TCP/IP, or NetBEUI transport.

The PATHWORKS License Manager, which must execute on the same node as
the License Server, provides a user interface that allows the system
manager to monitor client license usage. The PATHWORKS License Man-
ager is also used to pre-allocate licenses to specific groups of users
and to reclaim a license from a client.

____________________
 Note  that although the license server can be active on a single node
  in a cluster, if that node goes down for any reason, the license server
  will automatically activate itself on another node in the cluster that

  is still running PATHWORKS.


                                10

 

The PATHWORKS License Registrar, which executes on the same system as
the file server, verifies the licenses for clients requesting access
to the server functions. Clients that can produce a valid client-based
license are allowed access to the services offered by the PATHWORKS
V5 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) server.

-  Server-based License Management

The PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) server also allows client
access based on a local server-based license. If a client requesting
access to the server fails to produce a valid client-based license,
the PATHWORKS License Registrar software checks the local LMF database
for the availability of a PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) PC
Concurrent license. If one is available, and the number of concurrently-
connected clients allowed by the license has not been exceeded, the
client is allowed access.

Note that PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) server allows you to
use both client-based and server-based licenses, simultaneously. How-
ever, since clients that have a valid client-based license are already
licensed to use the server software, they are never counted against
the fixed number of clients granted access by the server-based PC Con-
current license.

Accommodation of Retired Features

The following features of PATHWORKS V4.x for OpenVMS are not provided
in PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS:

o  File services over LAST

o  Disk services

o  Remote boot over LAST

If PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS is installed on a server system which had
been running V4.x of the product, some aspects of the V4.x environ-
ment related to the features listed above will be preserved. Disk ser-
vices will remain intact and available to pre-V5 clients. LAST-based
remote boot services will also remain intact and available to pre-V5
clients.

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
The systems, components, and peripherals specified below are supported
except as noted.

Processors Supported

All VAX and Alpha processors that are supported by the version of the
OpenVMS operating system in use are also supported by PATHWORKS V5 for
OpenVMS (LAN Manager) with the following exceptions:

MicroVAX    MicroVAX I, MicroVAX II, MicroVAX 2000

VAXstation  VAXstation I, VAXstation II, VAXstation 2000, VAXsta-
            tion 8000

VAX         VAX-11/725, VAX-11/730, VAX 11/750, VAX 11/780, VAX
            11/782, VAX 11/785

Memory Requirements

PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS requires the following minimum physical mem-
ory for proper installation, configuration, and execution of the soft-
ware:

   16 MBytes on VAX systems (24 MBytes if used with DECnet-Plus)

   64 MBytes on Alpha systems

Note that the memory requirements indicated above are minimum require-
ments only, and that memory requirements can vary widely according to
the server CPU, the number of clients using the server and their ac-
tivities, the number and speed of the server's disks and the other ap-
plications running on the server.

For example, a typical configuration supporting a light workload (word
processing or spreadsheet applications) for 50 PC users requires an
Alpha system with approximately 64 MB of memory or a VAX system with


                                12

 

approximately 16 - 24 MB of memory. This assumes that 80% of the sys-
tem memory and CPU time are dedicated to PATHWORKS, even though some
work loads may use less.

Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size=1)

The following table provides the disk space requirements for the in-
stallation and configuration of PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS (LAN Man-
ager) either stand-alone or with PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare)
software. By default, all entries are directed to the same disk, but
each may be directed to different disks.

o  For the NetBEUI transport, PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) pro-
   vides the same level of support for Ethernet and FDDI as the Open-
   VMS operating system. For more information, see SPD 25.01.xx. PATH-
   WORKS V5 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) does not support NetBEUI over
   Token Ring on VAX systems.

The PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS server does not support the DEFZA FDDI
controller.

CLUSTER ENVIRONMENT

PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) supports all OpenVMS cluster
configurations. OpenVMS cluster configurations for Alpha systems are
fully described in the OpenVMS Cluster Software for OpenVMS Alpha Soft-
ware Product Description (SPD 42.18.xx). OpenVMS cluster configura-
tions for VAX systems are fully described in the OpenVMS Cluster Soft-
ware for OpenVMS VAX Software Product Description (SPD 29.78.xx).

PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) supports up to 31 server nodes
in cluster. In other words, no more than 31 nodes in a cluster can run
PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) concurrently. In a typical sce-
nario, the server is run on only a few central nodes, to exploit the
cluster's shared disks and high speed interconnect environment.

In a cluster, PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) supports simul-
taneous file access by all nodes running the server. A central event
log and central LAN Manager accounts and share databases are maintained
in a cluster. In a LAN Manager domain, the OpenVMS cluster represents
a single domain member, whether it is acting as the primary domain con-
troller, the backup domain controller or a member server.

chased separately. The following TCP/IP transports support PATHWORKS
V5.0F for OpenVMS:

o  Digital's TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS V4.1

o  Multinet V3.5 rev A

o  Process Software Corporation's TCPware for OpenVMS V5.0-4

o  The Wollongong Group's PathWay V1.1

Other PATHWORKS Server Software

PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) and PATHWORKS V1.0F for Open-
VMS (NetWare) now share some common components. As a result, only cer-
tain combinations of PATHWORKS server software can run on the same ma-
chine at the same time.
The following PATHWORKS server products can run on the same system as
PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS (LAN Manager):

o  PATHWORKS V1.x for OpenVMS (Macintosh)

o  PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare)

The following PATHWORKS server products cannot run on the same sys-
tem as PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS (LAN Manager):

                                18

 

o  PATHWORKS V1.0x for OpenVMS (NetWare).
   If the V1.0x (NetWare) server is installed on a system to which the
   V5.0F (LAN Manager) server is added, the V1.0 (NetWare) server is
   automatically upgraded to the V1.0F (NetWare) server. Only PATH-
   WORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) can run on the same system as PATH-
   WORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS (LAN Manager).

o  PATHWORKS for OpenVMS V4.x.
   The PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS server can be installed and con-
   figured on a system running the V4.x server, but actually running
   the V5.0F server on a system also running the V4.x server is not
   possible or supported.

Client Software

The following versions of client software are supported for use in con-
junction with PATHWORKS for OpenVMS:

o  PATHWORKS V6.0 for DOS and Windows (LAN Manager) (SPD 55.07.xx)

o  PATHWORKS for OS/2[R] V5.1 (SPD 55.24.xx)

o  LAN Manager V2.2 workstation software for DOS, Windows, and OS/2

o  Microsoft Windows NT workstation software V3.1, V3.5, or V4.0

o  Microsoft Windows for Workgroups V3.11

o  Microsoft Windows 95

The TCP/IP transport is included with the PATHWORKS V5 for DOS and Win-
dows client. PATHWORKS for DOS V4.x clients operating in a TCP/IP en-
vironment require the PATHWORKS for DOS (TCP/IP) V2.0 software.

PATHWORKS for DOS and Windows clients that access the services of a
PATHWORKS for OpenVMS server via remote methods require PATHWORKS Re-
mote V5.0 or later.

SOFTWARE LICENSING

PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) can be licensed in two differ-
ent ways.

o  Client-based licensing (Designated Access license)

This product can be licensed for operation and access on any number
of supported platforms to provide services to clients assigned appro-
priate client-based licenses.

See the attached PATHWORKS license terms and conditions for Designated
Access licenses for a description of the specific rights granted. See
below for applicable client license types and ordering information.

o  Server-based licensing (PC Concurrent)

A PATHWORKS PC Concurrent license for this product permits its use on
a single supported platform and allows access by clients that do not
have a PATHWORKS client-based license.

See the attached PATHWORKS License terms and conditions for PC Con-
current licenses for a description of the specific rights granted. See
below for applicable ordering information.

Note: Clients with client-based licenses for server access do not in-
terfere with the access of other clients that rely on server-based li-
censing for access to a particular server. The two licensing methods
are designed to coexist.

As of September 1, 1997, V5.0F will support Client Access licenses.
These Client Access Licenses will be available with shipment of the
next release of PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Advanced Server), version 6.0.
Prior versions of PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) will not sup-
port or recognize the Client Access License.

The Client Access License will replace the licenses sold today. Or-
ganizations must upgrade to V5.0F if they plan to add clients to their
environments after September 1, since V5.0F, at a minimum, will be re-
quired to add new clients.

The Client Access licensing applies only to PATHWORKS V5.0F for Open-
VMS (LAN Manager) and PATHWORKS V6.0 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) server
and will not be available until September 1, 1997. PATHWORKS servers
for NetWare and Macintosh will continue to be licensed as they are to-
day.
