 PRODUCT NAME:  POSIX for OpenVMS VAX, Version 3.0      SPD 34.82.06

 DESCRIPTION

 POSIX[R] for OpenVMS[TM] Version 3.0 brings support for the POSIX (Portable
 Operating System Interface for Computing Environments) Industry Stan-
 dards and for the X/Open[TM] BASE Profile specifications as defined
 in the X/Open Portability Guide Issue 4, to OpenVMS on the VAX[TM] plat-
 form.

 POSIX and XPG4 define a set of interface standards for various parts
 of an operating system. Both provide a comprehensive set of standards,
 draft standards, and specifications that support interoperability and
 portability of applications at the source code level. Because of the
 consistency they afford to applications at the operating system level,
 the POSIX standards and XPG4 specifications are essential underpin-
 nings of open computing environments. In fact, POSIX for OpenVMS Ver-
 sion 3.0 provides the capability on OpenVMS to develop and run appli-
 cations conforming to the POSIX and the XPG4 standards.

 The POSIX standards development effort is sponsored by the Institute
 of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE[R]). As individual POSIX
 standards are approved, organizations such as the International Or-
 ganization for Standardization (ISO) are also embracing them. XPG4 has
 been developed by X/Open, which is an independent consortium of com-
 puter systems manufacturers; XPG4 specifies a comprehensive applica-
 tions interface that includes POSIX 1003.1-1988 (as upgraded by POSIX
 1003.1-1990) and POSIX 1003.2-1992 as well as an additional set of de
 facto and formal standards.

                                                    15-December-1995

 

 POSIX for OpenVMS Version 3.0 includes support for the standards and
 draft standards for the POSIX system application programming inter-
 face (POSIX 1003.1, 1988 and 1990), POSIX shell and utilities (POSIX
 1003.2, which includes the User Portability Extension, formerly POSIX
 P1003.2a), and real time programming (1003.1b, formerly POSIX P1003.4).
 POSIX for OpenVMS Version 3.0 also supports the XPG4 BASE Profile spec-
 ifications, internationalized system calls and functions, commands and
 utilities, with the C language. (For a listing of the specific stan-
 dards supported by POSIX for OpenVMS Version 3.0, refer to following
 sections).

 User Environments

 o  Program Development Environment

 The program development environment for POSIX for OpenVMS Version 3.0
 allows the use of tools from both the OpenVMS development environment
 and the POSIX for OpenVMS Version 3.0 environment. Program develop-
 ers who choose to work at DCL level can use the OpenVMS program de-
 velopment environment tools, including the supported C compilers, the
 OpenVMS Linker, and OpenVMS Debugger, as well as application build-
 ing tools included in VAXset[TM]. Program developers who choose to work
 at the POSIX for OpenVMS Version 3.0 shell level can use the POSIX en-
 vironment defined in POSIX 1003.2, including the vi text editor, c89
 (for linking and compiling programs), make (for building applications),
 ar (for archiving object modules). Also supplied are the lex lexical
 analyzer and the yacc compiler compiler.

 o  Interactive User Environment

 The interactive user environment for POSIX for OpenVMS Version 3.0 pro-
 vides the user with a set of UNIX[R]-like commands and utilities that
 include functions similar to DCL, in addition to functions unavail-
 able in the DCL environment. For example the POSIX for OpenVMS Ver-
 sion 3.0 shell supports "pipes" which allow the output of one command
 to become the input of a subsequent command.




                                  2

 

 Assistance on how to use the POSIX for OpenVMS Version 3.0 features
 is available both via standard OpenVMS Online Help and a POSIX-conformant
 man command. The man command supplies reference information on all of
 the supported utilities, callable functions, datatypes and data struc-
 tures using the typical user interface familiar to UNIX users.

 o  End User Environment (Running POSIX and XPG4 Programs)

 POSIX for OpenVMS Version 3.0 programs are run from either the Open-
 VMS DCL level or the POSIX for OpenVMS Version 3.0 shell level. A cap-
 tive account can also be created, in which a user who accesses the sys-
 tem is limited to running one or more POSIX or XPG4 applications.

 POSIX Standards

 This section gives more detail on the POSIX standards implemented by
 POSIX for OpenVMS Version 3.0.

 o  POSIX 1003.1

 POSIX 1003.1 is an approved standard, adopted by the IEEE and endorsed
 by X/Open, ANSI, and ISO. It was first approved in 1988 as IEEE Std
 1003.1-1988. In 1990 the standard was revised to IEEE Std 1003.1-1990
 and also became the international standard ISO/IEC 9945-1.

 POSIX 1003.1 is the standard most commonly supported by open system
 vendors today. It defines a standard for the basic system services to
 be provided by an operating system. These are the services which will
 allow an application to perform operations such as process creation
 and execution, file system access, and I/O device management.

 o  POSIX P1003.1a

 The draft standard IEEE P1003.1a covers extensions to IEEE 1003.1 and
 has not yet been incorporated into the final standard. POSIX for Open-
 VMS Version 3.0 currently implements draft 4.

 o  POSIX 1003.1b


                                  3

 

 POSIX 1003.1b is an approved standard, adopted by the IEEE in 1993.
 It was formerly the POSIX P1003.4 draft standard. It addresses require-
 ments for real-time computing and support for such functions as mem-
 ory management, semaphores, message queues, scheduling, real-time files
 and signals, asynchronous I/O operations and timers.

 o  POSIX 1003.2

 POSIX 1003.2 is an approved standard, adopted by the IEEE in 1992, and
 endorsed by X/Open, ANSI, and ISO. It includes the User Portability
 Extension (UPE) functionality formerly defined in the POSIX P1003.2a
 draft standard. It provides an interactive interface to shell and util-
 ity services, and a series of callable functions for regular expres-
 sion handling.

 The 1003.2-based interactive interface to POSIX for OpenVMS Version
 3.0 is a set of UNIX-like commands and utilities. The POSIX for Open-
 VMS Version 3.0 command language interpreter (shell) has many of the
 functions and features of the Korn Shell. The POSIX for OpenVMS Ver-
 sion 3.0 interactive interface also includes a group of complex util-
 ities (such as awk, lex, make and yacc), a series of C-language pro-
 gramming de- velopment utilities, and a text editor, vi.

 XPG4 BASE Profile Specifications

 This section gives more detail on Issue 4 of the X/Open Portability
 Guide specifications implemented by POSIX for OpenVMS Version 3.0.

 o  XPG4 System Interfaces and Headers

 The XPG4 specifications include all the POSIX 1003.1 system calls and
 functions together with extensions. POSIX for OpenVMS Version 3.0 im-
 plements all the mandatory functions defined in this specification as
 well as the functionality indicated as "extension" and "FIPS".

 o  XPG4 Commands and Utilities




                                  4

 

 With the XPG4 specifications, a number of new commands and utilities
 are required in addition to those defined with POSIX 1003.2. POSIX for
 OpenVMS Version 3.0 implements the mandatory commands and utilities
 defined in this specification as well as the functionality indicated
 as "extension" and "FIPS".

 o  XPG4 Internationalization Features

 The internationalization features provided within XPG4 allow for the
 run-time environment of a program to be set up to provide the correct
 processing/presentation of local language text and cultural data; no
 recompiling or relinking is required. Program messages may be stored
 separate from the logic of a program and translated into several lan-
 guages using the Message Catalogue system. The cultural environment
 of a program is obtained by associating it with a specific set of lo-
 calization data, called a "locale". POSIX for OpenVMS Version 3.0 con-
 tains the locale for American English; users can build their own lo-
 cales for other languages. Examples of other locales are provided.

 The specification provides support for the ISO 8859-1:1987 8 bit char-
 acter set which covers the major European languages.

 XPG4 multibyte character internationalization for the shell and util-
 ities is not supported.

 C Language Extensions

 Conformance to the POSIX standards and XPG4 specifications has meant
 changes and additional functionality for the C run-time library pro-
 vided with the C compiler.

 The stdio library functions support the behavior required by POSIX 1003.1.
 The C run-time library supports the ISO C features required by POSIX
 1003.1.

 POSIX for OpenVMS Version 3.0 includes support for internationalized
 regular expression matching and compiling functions, native language
 message handling functions, and native language versions of the er-
 ror handling functions.

                                  5

 

 POSIX for OpenVMS Version 3.0 also supports table creation/search/deletion
 functions for linear tables, hash tables, and tree structured tables,
 as well as mathematical functions. Further additions and changes have
 been necessary to incorporate the TCP/IP Sockets calls.

 POSIX for OpenVMS Version 3.0 supports all the floating point features
 introduced by OpenVMS Version 6.1.

 All the above enhancements are part of the POSIX C RTL which is in-
 voked by the c89 preprocessor provided as part of POSIX for OpenVMS
 Version 3.0.

 Supported Standards and Components - a Summary

 The following list summarizes the formal and draft POSIX standards and
 components of the XPG4 BASE Profile specification implemented by POSIX
 for OpenVMS Version 3.0:

 o  POSIX IEEE Std. 1003.1-1988

 o  POSIX IEEE Std. 1003.1-1990 ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990

 POSIX and XPG4 Conformance and Certification

 o  POSIX Conformance

 The POSIX standards require that suppliers who claim conformance pro-
 vide a conformance document that describes how the supplier implements
 the standard. This is the only proof of conformance required by the
 IEEE. In the United States, the National Institute of Standards and
 Technology (NIST) has developed the POSIX Conformance Test Suite or
 PCTS. The PCTS tests for conformance to NIST's Federal Information Pro-
 cessing Standard (FIPS 151-2), which is based on POSIX 1003.1-1990.
 All versions of OpenVMS from V5.5 onwards are FIPS 151 certifiable;
 the V6.1 release of the OpenVMS operating system on both VAX and Al-
 pha platforms has achieved FIPS 151-2 certification. The V6.2 and V7.0
 releases of the OpenVMS operating system on both VAX and Alpha plat-
 forms are FIPS 151-2 certifiable.

 o  XPG4 Base Profile Branding

 Software vendors whose products implement XPG4 BASE Profile specifi-
 cations can apply to X/Open for the right to display the X/Open BASE
 Profile brand. The X/Open BASE Profile brand identifies that a sys-
 tem fulfills the comprehensive and stringent set of X/Open require-
 ments by:

    -  Implementing the minimum set of components required to create
       the XPG4 Common Applications Environment. This set of XPG4 BASE
       Profile components consists of the internationalized system calls
       and functions, commands and utilities, and the C language as im-
       plemented on a specific hardware platform.

    -  Passing those portions of the Verification Suite for X/Open (VSX)
       that test the implementation of these XPG4 BASE Profile compo-
       nents. Components must pass a series of more than 10000 tests
       in VSX to earn the X/Open BASE Profile Brand.

 OpenVMS VAX V5.5 and V6.0 are XPG3 BASE branded (as of June 1992). The
 V6.1 and V6.2 releases of the OpenVMS operating system on both VAX and
 Alpha platforms achieved XPG4 BASE Profile Branding. V7.0 release of

                                  7

 

 the OpenVMS operating system on both VAX and Alpha platforms is XPG4
 brandable.

 Documents relating to the FIPS 151-2 Certification and the XPG4 Base
 Profile Branding are available on request. To obtain copies, please
