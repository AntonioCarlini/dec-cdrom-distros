 Product Name:  MAILbus 400 Message Transfer Agent      SPD 42.83.04
                for OpenVMS VAX, Version 2.0

 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

 MAILbus 400[TM] Message Transfer Agent (MTA) for OpenVMS[TM] VAX[TM]
 is a layered software product that resides on an OpenVMS VAX system.
 MAILbus 400 MTA provides electronic messaging services in an open net-
 work environment. These services are used by messaging applications,
 such as user agents and gateways. MAILbus 400 MTA provides the elec-
 tronic messaging services of an X.400 MTA, designed to conform to the
 1992 CCITT series of recommendations and the 1988 joint CCITT and ISO
 Message Handling System Standards and their subsequent revisions. A
 messaging network based on MAILbus 400 MTAs can function as all, or
 part of, a Private Management Domain or Administration Management Do-
 main.

 MAILbus 400 MTA uses DECnet[TM]/OSI[R] for OpenVMS for OSI protocol
 support, and Digital[TM] X.500 Directory Service for directory ser-
 vices.

 MAILbus 400 MTA operates over the OSI protocols, as supported by DEC-
 net/OSI for OpenVMS. MAILbus 400 MTA can also operate over TCP/IP net-
 works, using the RFC 1006 protocol, as supported by DECnet/OSI. The
 RFC 1006 protocol emulates the OSI Transport Service Protocol Class
 0 over a TCP/IP network service.

 MAILbus 400 MTA can communicate with:

 o  Another MAILbus 400 MTA

 o  A VAX Message Router[TM]/X.400 Gateway

                                                          March 1996

                                                         AE-PVRPE-TE

 

 o  Another vendor's X.400 MTA

 MAILbus 400 MTA provides management services conforming to the Dig-
 ital[TM] Enterprise Management Architecture (EMA), integrated with DECnet/OSI.
 This provides local and remote management of MAILbus 400 MTA opera-
 tion.

 MAILbus 400 MTA supports an interface for messaging applications such
 as user agents and gateways; access to this is provided by MAILbus 400
 Application Program Interface.

 MAILbus 400 MTA provides the following services to collect informa-
 tion about messages:

 o  Accounting services, to record particular items of information about
    messages.

 o  Archiving services, to retain complete copies of messages.

 o  Message history logging services, to record information about mes-
    sages for tracing purposes.

 MAILbus 400 MTA provides an Interpersonal Messaging Service (IPMS) body-
 part conversion service, based on recipient capabilities registered
 in the directory. The set of bodypart converters provided with MAIL-
 bus 400 MTA provides a selected set of conversions between the fol-
 lowing bodypart types:

 o  IA5

 o  Teletex

 o  ISO/6937

 o  General text (for ISO IR repertoires covering ISOLatin1, ISO/6937,
    and Teletex)

 o  DEC[TM] Multinational Character Set

 o  Message Router Text

 o  WPS-PLUS[TM]

                                  2

 

 o  DECdx[TM]

 MAILbus 400 MTA supports conversion between Externally Defined Body-
 parts and File Transfer Bodyparts. In addition to providing conver-
 sion services, MAILbus 400 MTA supports transfer and receipt of any
 X.400 IPMS bodypart types, and non-IPMS content types.

 MAILbus 400 MTA is typically used in conjunction with other Digital-
 supplied messaging products, such as user agents and gateways. The fol-
 lowing are examples of messaging products that can be used in conjunc-
 tion with MAILbus 400 MTA to provide a complete messaging solution:

 License units for this product are allocated on an Unlimited System
 Use and Concurrent Use basis.

 Each Concurrent Use license allows a specified number of messages to
 be processed by the MAILbus 400 MTA in a 24 hour period. If the num-
 ber of messages processed by the MAILbus 400 MTA in a 24 hour period
 exceeds the number of messages for which the MAILbus 400 MTA is li-
 censed, a warning message is output to inform the user that they are
 in breach of their licensing agreement. The MAILbus 400 MTA will con-
 tinue to process messages even if the licensed number of messages is
 exceeded.

 The MAILbus 400 MTA Unlimited System Use license imposes no restric-
 tions on the number of messages that the MAILbus 400 MTA can process
 in a 24 hour period.

 All licenses for the MAILbus 400 MTA allow the installation and use
 of the MAILbus 400 MTA base component on any OpenVMS VAX system op-
 erating an application that requires access to the MAILbus 400 MTA.
