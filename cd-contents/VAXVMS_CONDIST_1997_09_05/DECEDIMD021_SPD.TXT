 DESCRIPTION

 Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) enables users to electronically ex-
 change structured business documents such as Purchase Orders, Dispatch
 Advice and Invoices with their Trading Partners using International,
 National and Industry-specific EDI standards. DEC/EDI offers appli-
 cation developers all the facilities necessary to EDI-enable Business
 Applications within an Enterprise. Extensive communication options are
 also provided to facilitate inter-enterprise communication via EDI VANs
 or direct with Trading Partners using OSI[R] protocols.

 DEC/EDI uses a Client/Server architecture to provide EDI services to
 local and remote Business Applications hosted on multi-vendor plat-
 forms within an enterprise.

                                                       December 1996

                                                         AE-PBHLH-TE

 

 DEC/EDI Application Client

 The DEC/EDI Application Client facilitates the integration of local
 and remote Business Applications to the DEC/EDI Server, to make them
 EDI-capable. ObjectBroker (DEC ACA Services) is used to link the lo-
 cally or remotely installed DEC/EDI Application Clients to the DEC/EDI
 Server, using either TCP/IP or DECnet communication protocols.

 DEC/EDI Application Clients are available today for:

 o  Digital UNIX[R]

 o  OpenVMS[TM] Alpha

 o  OpenVMS VAX[TM]

 o  HP-UX[R]

 o  IBM[R] AIX [R]

 o  Sun[R] Solaris[R]

 o  IBM OS/400[R]

 These DEC/EDI Application Clients can interoperate with a DEC/EDI Server
 running on Digital UNIX, OpenVMS VAX or OpenVMS Alpha platforms.

 The interface provided by the DEC/EDI Application Client is file-based
 and allows for the Business Application to POST and FETCH files to and
 from Trading Partners via the DEC/EDI Server.

 The DEC/EDI Application Clients can be invoked via the Command Line
 Interface (CLI) and the Application Program Interface (API). The CLI
 can be run from a suitably coded script file (command file) or invoked
 interactively.

 The DEC/EDI Application Client also provides the following functions:

 o  Enables local and remote Business Applications to extract document
    status information via the TRACK Command, from the DEC/EDI Server.

                                  2

 

 o  Enable Business Applications to POST and FETCH files to and from
    other DEC/EDI Application Clients attached to the same DEC/EDI Server.
    The information exchanged between DEC/EDI Application Clients is
    mapped from the input format to the recipiant format by using File-
    Bridge MAPs based on an EDI Message definition.

 o  POST and FETCH documents to and from the DEC/EDI Server and by-pass
    the Mapping or Mapping and Translation functions, for transmission
    and receipt to and from trading partners via the DEC/EDI Communi-
    cation Component.

 DEC/EDI Server

 The DEC/EDI Server consists of the following components which reside
 on the same node:

 o  DEC/EDI FileBridge Component

 o  DEC/EDI Translation Component

 o  DEC/EDI Communications Component

 o  DEC/EDI Operational Management Component

 FileBridge Component

 FileBridge is a table-driven "MAPPER" with a set of data manipulation
 operators for selected classes of commonly encountered EDI applica-
 tion data. This capability is used to convert data from the existing
 Business Application file format to that required for Translation into
 the Trading Partner format as well as formatting data received from
 the trading partner to the file format expected by the Business Ap-
 plication.

 The Mapping Process consists of:

 o  Data Specification



                                  3

 

 The customer defines the application file structure, and parameters
 for mapping between the application file and the EDI standard through
 a forms-based user interface. FileBridge then generates a conversion
 table that is used to map data from/to the application file formats.

 o  User Defined Mapping

 FileBridge allows fields to be moved directly to the destination or
 to have built-in mathematical/logical/string operations to be performed
 upon the fields. The user interface guides the user through this pro-
 cess. The user can define and add code through "hooks" for more com-
 plex processing.

 o  Data Definition Extracts

 FileBridge also allows for the extraction of Application file record
 definitions from Oracle[R] CDD/Repository.

 The components of FileBridge are:

 o  FileBridge User Interface (UI)

 The UI consists of a set of menus and forms that allow users to cre-
 ate, modify, and compile FileBridge tables.

 o  FileBridge Run-time

 The Run-time process uses the information in a compiled FileBridge ta-
 ble to map data between the Business Application file and the format
 required for transmission and receipt to and from trading partners.

 Translation Component

 The Translation Component takes data that has come from the Business
 Application and transforms it into the standard EDI formats required
 for transmission to the Trading Partner. It also takes incoming EDI
 data, that has been received from a Trading Partner by the Communi-
 cations Component, and converts it into the format that is suitable
 for the Mapper to decode and pass to the Application Client.

                                  4

 

 The Translation Component provides the following features:

 o  Support for multiple versions of messages (transactions) and EDI
    standards

 o  Supports the transmission of 8-bit national character sets

 o  Compliance checking at Trading Partner level

 o  Trading Partner specific Code Translation

 o  User-selectable control number generation

 o  Test transmissions

 o  Event and Error logging

 An editor is provided to enable users to customise the messages de-
 livered with the product to create new messages for industry specific
 and Trading Partner specific messages as well as create new messages
 based on ANSI X12, TDCC, EDIFACT, ODETTE, and TRADACOMS[TM] syntax rules
 supported by this version of the product. The editor also allows for
 the creation of new versions of EDI Standard dictionaries.

 Trading Partner agreement details, including the message formats be-
 ing used, are recorded in the Trading Partner Profiles. The Transla-
 tion Component uses the information in the Trading Partner Profiles
 and the Message Database to perform compliance checking and to check
 the validity of the transaction.

 The Translation Component provides support for the following EDI stan-
 dards:

 o  EDIFACT

    -  Implements ISO 9735

    -  Supports character set A, lower-case a-z, and 8-bit national char-
       acter sets.

       ISO 9735 syntax

                                  5

 

 o  ANSI X12

    -  Automatic generation of Functional Acknowledgements and recon-
       ciliation of Functional Acknowledgements

    -  Supports industry-specific transactions adhering to the ANSI X12
       syntax

 o  TDCC

    -  Automatic generation of Functional Acknowledgements, 997 and 999
       and reconciliation of Functional Acknowledgements

    -  Support for the following types of messages is not provided:

       *  Messages which contain two mandatory instances of the same
          segment, at the same level, when other segments appear be-
          tween the two instances (for example, Transaction 994 and its
          use of the K2 segment)

       *  Messages which use EDIFACT enveloping

 o  ODETTE

    -  Support for Version 2.0 of ODETTE

 o  TRADACOMS

    -  Implements the TRADACOMS (October 1989 Update) syntax and mes-
       sages

 Communications Component

 The Communications Component supports a range of communications op-
 tions including OSI. It enables users to send EDI transmissions ei-
 ther through EDI VANs or direct to their Trading Partners.

 The Communications Component provides the following features:

 o  Flexible scheduling using windows and jobs

 o  Priority processing to override the scheduler

                                  6

 These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
 sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
 system environment, configuration, and software options.

 Additional disk space is required depending on the number of Mapping
 tables, performance needs, message size and software options.

 Memory Requirements

 The minimum memory supported is 64MB. However, the use of this soft-
 ware in conjunction with increased memory and multiple disks improves
 performance. The memory size suggested for most typical hardware con-
 figurations is at least 128MB (especially when the X.25 and/or X.400
 products are installed on the same processor).
