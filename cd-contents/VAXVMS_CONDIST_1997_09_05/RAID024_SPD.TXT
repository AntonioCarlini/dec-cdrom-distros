 PRODUCT NAME:  StorageWorks RAID Software              SPD 46.49.05
                for OpenVMS, Version 2.4

 DESCRIPTION

 StorageWorks[R] RAID Software for OpenVMS[R] is a software product that
 uses RAID technology to manage groups of disk drives as arrays. The
 product supports RAID Level 0 arrays (Disk striping) for enhanced I/O
 performance and RAID Level 5 arrays (Disk striping with parity) for
 enhanced data availability on both VAX[R] and Alpha platforms. RAID
 Software also allows partitioning or segmentation of a RAID Array into
 multiple virtual devices.

 StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS Capabilities and Features

 StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS manages groups of between 1 and
 32 physical disks (between 3 and 32 for RAID Level 5) as arrays. Ap-
 plications use a virtual disk as if it were a physical disk.

 A total of 50 such arrays per VMScluster system are supported, in any
 mixture of RAID Level 0 and RAID Level 5.

 StorageWorks RAID virtual disks may be accessed directly from any mem-
 ber of a VMScluster system for which a valid license is in effect. (All
 VMScluster systems may access virtual disks created using the Stor-
 age Concurrent Use license QL-0MGAA-3B.) Virtual disks may not be MSCP[R]
 served.

 The disks in a StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS array may be of
 different types, although disks of a single type are recommended for
 consistent performance and optimal use of storage capacity.

 StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS virtual disks may not be used
 to boot the OpenVMS Operating System, nor may they serve as VMSclus-
 ter quorum disks. They may, however, contain OpenVMS page and swap files.

 StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS may be used in conjunction with
 OpenVMS Volume Shadowing (Phase II only). OpenVMS shadow sets may be
 StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS array members (RAID Level 0 only),
 however, virtual disks may not be members of OpenVMS shadow sets.

 A RAID Level 0 array whose members are shadow sets is a high perfor-
 mance, high data availability storage solution for most applications.
 Single-member shadow sets may also be used as RAID array members so
 that the VAXsimPLUS autocopy feature may be employed as a failure pro-
 tection mechanism.

 Partitioning is the process of dividing a RAID array into one or more
 RAID virtual devices. The RAID Software allows you to specify how many
 partitions are to be used in a given RAID array and how large each par-
 tition should be. One or more partitions can be created on a single-
 member RAID Level 0 array or multiple-member RAID Level 0 or RAID Level
 5 arrays. The Maximum number of partitions for any array is 64.

 Features Applicable to RAID Level 0 Arrays

 The usable capacity of RAID Level 0 array is approximately given by:

    Usable Capacity = N * 0.99 * CS
    Where N is the number of physical disks in the array.
    CS is the storage capacity of the smallest disk in the array.

 The purpose of RAID Level 0 technology is to provide I/O intensive ap-
 plications with greater I/O performance from a given I/O hardware con-
 figuration than would normally be achieved by using the disks as in-
 dividual volumes. This is also referred to as Disk Striping. Depend-
 ing on the application, enhanced I/O performance may be delivered as:

 o  more I/O requests serviced per unit time due to probabilistic load
    balancing, or


                                  2

 

 o  higher data transfer rate due to concurrent transfer of data to or
    from more than one disk to satisfy a single request.

 Features Applicable to RAID Level 5 Arrays

 The usable capacity of RAID Level 5 array is approximately given by:

    Usable Capacity = (N-1) * 0.99 * CS
    Where N is the number of physical disks in the array.
    CS is the capacity of the smallest disk in the array.

 StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS protects against loss of data
 and loss of data accessibility due to the failure of any single disk
 in a RAID Level 5 array. If a disk in a RAID Level 5 array fails, Stor-
 ageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS provides continued service to ap-
 plications by regenerating the failed disk's data using information
 from the array's remaining disks. (For full protection against loss
 of data availability due to single hardware failures, StorageWorks RAID
 Software for OpenVMS software can be used in conjunction with redun-
 dant hardware and supporting software throughout the system.)

 While a RAID Level 5 array is reduced by a failed disk, data can be
 read and written, but no redundancy is provided. A second disk fail-
 ure while an array is reduced prevents application access to the data
 stored on the array, and may result in data loss.

 StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS reconstructs the contents of
 a failed disk if a replacement disk is assigned to it. Reconstruction
 does not interrupt application access to data on the array, although
 performance may be affected. Replacement disks may either be assigned
 to StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS by the storage administra-
 tor (using a DCL command) or they may be placed in a spareset asso-
 ciated with one or more RAID Level 5 arrays. If a disk in a RAID Level
 5 array with an associated spareset fails, StorageWorks RAID Software
 for OpenVMS automatically acquires a replacement disk from the spare-
 set and performs reconstruction without storage administrator inter-
 vention.

 Using StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS

 To use StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS, the storage adminis-
 trator first creates an array using DCL functions supplied with the
 software. This destroys any data previously stored on the disks and
 creates the data structures required to manage the array. The member
 disks of a StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS array are ODS-2 struc-
 tured volumes, so OpenVMS mechanisms protect against inadvertent mis-
 use of members for the life of the array.

 Each virtual disk created by StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS
 is a single management entity. The storage administrator should use
 appropriate storage management procedures (e.g., backups) with vir-
 tual disks, which can be considerably larger than typical physical disks.
 Once a collection of physical disks is bound into an array, it is not
 possible to retrieve data directly from the array's individual mem-
 ber disks.

 Performance of StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS

 The primary purpose of StorageWorks RAID for OpenVMS RAID Level 0 ar-
 rays is to enhance application performance by improving I/O request
 processing and/or data transfer rate. RAID Level 0 technology normally
 implies a reduction in data reliability. The storage administrator can
 improve data reliability by increasing backup frequency or using Stor-
 ageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS in conjunction with Volume Shad-
 owing for OpenVMS.

 The primary purpose of StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS RAID Level
 5 arrays is to improve data reliability. It may provide the secondary
 benefit of improved performance (due to load balancing) for applica-
 tions whose I/O workload consists largely of reading data. For appli-
 cations with mostly write I/O workloads, StorageWorks RAID Software
 for OpenVMS RAID Level 5 arrays may provide lower I/O performance than
 conventional disks because it must update redundant information each
 time an application writes data.



                                  4

 

 The storage administrator should understand application I/O charac-
 teristics and weigh the relative priorities of performance, equipment
 cost, and data reliability to determine whether StorageWorks RAID Soft-
 ware for OpenVMS is appropriate for use with a given application.

 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

 StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS is supported when used with the
 VAX and Alpha processors and VMScluster systems supported by OpenVMS.
 See the Software Requirements section for the supported OpenVMS ver-
 sions. StorageWorks RAID Software may be installed in a VMScluster con-
 figuration of any size supported by OpenVMS Software, but the Stor-
 ageWorks RAID Software has been qualified to run on a maximum of 20
 nodes within a single VMScluster configuration.

 StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS requires a minimum of 1 (for
 RAID Level 0) or 3 (for RAID Level 5) and a maximum of 32 physical disks
 for each array. Up to 50 arrays may be created in a single VMSclus-
 ter system. Disks, storage elements, (and the subsystem configurations
 that contain them) are supported by the OpenVMS Operating System Ver-
 sions listed above through the following device drivers shown in Ta-
 ble 1.

 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

 StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS requires the OpenVMS VAX Op-
 erating System (Version 5.5, 5.5-1, 5.5-2, 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, 7.0,and 7.1)
 or OpenVMS Alpha (Versions 1.5, 6.1, 6.2, 7.0 and 7.1) as a prereq-
 uisite. No other prerequisite software is required.
 Mixed-architecture VMScluster systems (i.e. containing both VAX and
 Alpha systems) are supported as long as all VMScluster members are run-
 ning compatible versions of the OpenVMS operating system supported by
 StorageWorks RAID Software. For a chart of the compatible versions of
 the operating systems, refer to the VAXcluster Software for OpenVMS
 VAX Software Product Description (SPD 29.78.xx) and the VMScluster Soft-
 ware for OpenVMS Alpha Software Product Description (SPD 42.18.xx).

 In order to bind StorageWorks RAID arrays, all physical disks that com-
 prise the RAID arrays must be accessible, (local or MSCP served), on
 all nodes in a VMScluster having the RAID software running.

 If RAID Level 0 arrays with OpenVMS shadow sets as members are required,
 a valid OpenVMS Volume Shadowing license must be in effect on every
 VMScluster node running the StorageWorks RAID Software. Shadow sets
 may not be used as members of RAID Level 5 arrays.

 ORDERING INFORMATION

 Two licensing options are available:

 RAID Array Access License:

    VAX: QL-0MHA*-AA
    Alpha: QL-2YFA*-AA

 This license option provides the purchaser with the right to use the
 StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS on a single VAX or Alpha sys-
 tem to create and use up to the supported number (50) of RAID arrays.
 One RAID Array Access License is required for each VAX or Alpha sys-
 tem in a VMScluster system on which StorageWorks RAID Software for Open-
 VMS is to execute.

 Storage Concurrent Use License:
    QL-0MGAA-3B

 This license option provides the purchaser with the right to include
 a single disk, storage element, or shadow set in an array. One Stor-
 age Concurrent Use License is required for each disk, storage element,
 or shadow set to be included in a StorageWorks RAID Software for Open-
 VMS array. Once an array is created, it may be accessed by any VMSclus-
 ter VAX or Alpha system.

 For purposes of the Storage Concurrent Use License, the measure of use
 is equal to a single disk, storage element, or shadow set to be in-
 cluded in an array, no matter how many VMScluster CPUs have access to
 that array. Each shadow set used as a member of a RAID Level 0 array

                                  7

 

 requires a single Concurrent Use License, regardless of the number of
 physical disks in the shadow set.
