 PRODUCT NAME:  VAX Remote Environmental                SPD 29.73.04
                Monitoring Software (REMS), Version 1.4

 DESCRIPTION

 VAX Remote Environmental Monitoring Software (REMS) V1.4, supports the
 following Digital products:

 o  HA3000 three-phase Uninterruptible Power
    Systems (UPS) (11kVA to 125kVA)

 o  HA1000 single-phase Uninterruptible Power System (3kVA to 10kVA)

 o  4N-AExxx series single-phase UPS systems (350 VA to 12kVA)

 o  H7317 Power Distribution System PLUS (PDS+)

 o  H7318 Power Conditioning System PLUS (PCS+)

 o  H731x Environmental Monitoring Systems (EMS)

 With the PDS+/PCS+ and/or EMS systems, complemented by the VAX REMS
 software, complete environmental surveillance of a computer site and
 supporting equipment is accomplished. In addition, VAX REMS communi-
 cates with the various UPS systems to accept alarm and status infor-
 mation from those products' internal sensors.

 Through the use of sensors that are both internal and external to the
 PDS+/PCS+ units and external sensors in the EMS units, environmental
 changes are detected, and depending upon user-defined threshold set-
 tings for these sensors, notification alarms are triggered on the host
 VAX system. Optionally, utilizing imbedded sensors within the vari-
 ous UPS systems, internal parameters and alarms are retrieved in a time-
 stamped sequence allowing this information to be included within the
 VMS file structure created by REMS. VAX REMS provides continuous unat-
 tended monitoring and collection of environmental data and will only

 require attention if an alarm condition is reached on one of its sen-
 sors.

 Menu driven or command input, VAX REMS facilitates the task of mon-
 itoring configured environmental sensors for a complete system, site,
 or enterprise. For status inquiry and alarm notification purposes, VAX
 REMS generally eliminates the need to use the H7310 local terminal in-
 terface, along with the PCS+/PDS+ and UPS consoles.

 Features

 VAX REMS can be used in menu or command mode. Menus or commands en-
 able the user to do the following:

 o  Add, delete, or configure external sensors on the H731x hardware

 o  Display probe data and status

 o  Monitor the inputs from a probe or a group of probes

 o  Display alarm conditions

 o  Display the communication status of the connected Digital devices

 o  Invoke a user process when a threshold condition occurs

 o  Generate historical reports of environmental history

 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
