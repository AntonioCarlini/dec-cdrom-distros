 

 This SPD describes Digital SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator for OpenVMS, which
 is available for the OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha platforms. All in-
 formation applies to both platforms unless otherwise indicated.

 DESCRIPTION

 The Digital SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator for OpenVMS (3270 TE) is a lay-
 ered software product that allows users of a VTxxx terminal (or other
 Digital terminal or personal computer in VT100, VT200 or VT300 mode)
 on suitably configured OpenVMS systems within a DECnet or TCP/IP net-
 work to interactively access IBM[R] host-based applications. These ap-
 plications have been originally developed for IBM 3270 display sta-
 tions in a Systems Network Architecture (SNA) networking environment.
 Access to the IBM host-based applications system from OpenVMS systems
 is via one of the following products:

 o  TCP/IP or DECnet connections:

    o  DEC SNA Peer Server

    o  DEC SNA Domain Gateway

 o  DECnet only connections:

    o  DECnet SNA Gateway for Synchronous Transport

    o  DECnet SNA Gateway for Channel Transport

    o  VMS/SNA - an OpenVMS VAX layered product that supports users on
       the system where VMS/SNA is running

 In normal operation, an IBM system transfers a formatted screen, much
 like a "form", to the 3270 block mode terminal and the user fills in
 any data required by the "form". When complete, the form is transmit-
 ted to the IBM host as a single unit. This mechanism is emulated with
 a Digital character mode terminal by buffering the "form" in the DEC-
 net host's memory and displaying it on the terminal. When the screen
 "form" is complete, it is sent to the IBM host system via the SNA gate-
 way or VMS/SNA product.

                                                       February 1996

                                                         AE-EX18I-TE

 

 Translation tables on the respective systems convert ASCII terminal
 input (either Digital Multinational Character Set or National Replace-
 ment Character Set) to a subset of IBM multinational EBCDIC code for
 transfer through either the SNA gateway or VMS/SNA product. These trans-
 lation tables may be modified to fit non-standard character sets.

 Users invoke the 3270 utility using the local OpenVMS system's com-
 mand language, including qualifiers to specify the target IBM system
 and system resources. While the emulation utility is operating, the
 terminal screen is formatted like a 3270 display. When the user has
 finished work on the IBM system, the 3270 emulator is dismissed and
 the terminal is "restored" as an OpenVMS command terminal.

 The 3270 Terminal Emulator supports emulation of the following fea-
 tures of an IBM 3270 Display Station when attached to an IBM 3274 1C

 This product has been designed such that it can be used with most IBM
 applications, however, those applications written using features not
 supported by the emulator (e.g. 3270 Extended Data Stream) must be mod-
 ified.

 A readily available on-line HELP facility provides information on keys
 with altered 3270-oriented functions. The status line as implemented
 on an actual 3270 display is not supported, however much of the same
 information is reported on a special status line which may be over-
 laid on the VT200's 24th line. In addition, the OpenVMS system man-
 ager has the ability to re-map certain IBM key functions onto differ-
 ent locations on the Digital keyboard.
