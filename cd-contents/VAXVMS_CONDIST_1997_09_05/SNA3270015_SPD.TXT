 

 This SPD describes DECnet SNA 3270 Data Stream Programming Interface
 for OpenVMS, which is available for the OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS AXP
 platforms. All information applies to both platforms unless otherwise
 indicated.

 DESCRIPTION

 DECnet SNA 3270 Data Stream Programming Interface for OpenVMS (3270
 DS) is a layered software product that allows user-written applica-
 tions running on suitably configured OpenVMS systems within a DEC-
 net network or on suitably configured OpenVMS systems within a VMS/SNA
 en- vironment to exchange messages with cooperating applications in
 an IBM[R] host. The 3270 DS software exists in the OpenVMS system as
 a share- able image. Access between the cooperating Digital and IBM
 applica- tions is via one of the following products:

 o  DECnet SNA Gateway for Synchronous Transport

 o  DECnet SNA Gateway for Channel Transport

 o  DEC SNA Domain Gateway for Channel Transport

 o  VMS/SNA - an OpenVMS VAX layered product that supports users on the
    system where VMS/SNA is running

 The 3270 DS programming interface is a collection of subroutines that
 provide an easy-to-use interface for the SNA Gateway or VMS/SNA ap-
 plication programmer who has a specific need to interface to an IBM
 application subsystem which uses LU Type 2 (LU2) protocol. The prod-
 uct can be used with many types of applications. As an example, a cus-
 tomized 3270 terminal emulator application can be written by a user
 and layered on top of 3270 DS. Applications can be event driven or syn-
 chronous in nature with no loss in available functions.

 Features

 The 3270 DS product is designed to insulate the OpenVMS application
 programmer from the inner workings of the SNA network environment as
 much as possible, thus allowing the user to concentrate on solving the

                                                          April 1996

                                                         AE-ET78H-TE

 

 application problem. The product performs the following SNA functions
 on the user's behalf:

 o  Receives and interprets the bind

 o  Accepts the bind and starts the session

 o  Maintains the state machines for chaining, bracketing, and data flow
    control

 o  Processes an Unbind Type 2 automatically

 As a result, the OpenVMS user is required to perform a minimum of SNA
 functions including processing the CLEAR and CANCEL functions and han-
 dling contention.

 This product is a set of subroutines used to perform such functions
 as establishing sessions, sending data, receiving data, and discon-
 necting sessions. In addition, the 3270 DS interface may be used to
 interpret the 3270 data stream and build a screen image. The OpenVMS
 application is then free to interact with the screen image.

 The 3270 DS product allows two modes of connection: Data Stream Mode
 and Field Mode.

 Data Stream Mode

 Data Stream Mode provides a means to send and receive uninterpreted
 3270 data streams as defined by IBM. In this mode, all SNA specific
 functions are performed by the interface. For example, the OpenVMS ap-
 plication is not required to handle chaining, brackets, RUs, or RHs.
 At the same time, this mode allows the interface to provide the Open-
 VMS application with the complete 3270 data stream. It is the Open-
 VMS user's responsibility to interpret the outbound data stream for
 3270 orders and commands, and to build and manipulate a screen image
 (if desired). Similarly, it is the OpenVMS user's responsibility to
 build the inbound data stream from his own screen image or from some
 other data structure.


                                  2

 

 An OpenVMS application which needs to use extended attributes must use
 a Data Stream Mode connection. Extended attributes are extensions to
 the basic field attributes, namely:

 o  Extended highlighting (blink, reverse video, underscore)

 o  Color

 o  Programmed symbols (selectable symbol set)

 o  Screen partitions and windows

 Field Mode

 Field Mode performs a presentation service to provide a screen image
 interface. The screen image may be read field by field, or accessed
 directly. The interface interprets 3270 commands and orders in an out-
 bound data stream to build the screen. In addition, it produces an
 in- bound 3270 data stream from the updated screen image.

 As with the Data Stream Mode, Field Mode insulates the OpenVMS user
 from the SNA protocol. Extended attributes are not supported by the
 Field Mode connection.

 Asynchronous Event Notification

 The 3270 DS product provides a mechanism for an OpenVMS user appli-
 cation to receive control when an asynchronous "network event" occurs
 such as disconnection of a DECnet logical link, an SNA circuit fail-
 ure, or the receipt of an Unbind Type 2 from IBM. The OpenVMS appli-
 cation is called at a notification entry point defined by the appli-
 cation at connection time; an indication of the event that occurred
 is reported.

 User Interface

 Users of the 3270 DS product should be experienced OpenVMS applica-
 tion programmers. They can use any of the OpenVMS programming languages
 which conform to the OpenVMS Calling Standard to create application
 programs which interact with application programs on an IBM system.
 The user documentation provides example segments written in the fol-
 lowing languages:

                                  3

 

 o  MACRO-32

 o  BLISS-32 Implementation Language

 o  C

 o  COBOL

 o  FORTRAN

 o  PASCAL

 o  PL/I

 The users of the 3270 DS product are not required to have extensive
 knowledge of SNA.

 Features of Version 1.5

 o  OpenVMS 3270 DS V1.5 supports Digital's License Management Facil-
    ity.

 o  OpenVMS 3270 DS V1.5 allows, on supported SNA gateways and VMS/SNA
    systems, secured Logical Unit (LU) access via the SNA3270$REQUEST_
    CONNECT procedure call.

 INSTALLATION

 Only experienced customers should attempt installation of this prod-
 uct. Digital recommends that all other customers purchase Digital's
 Installation Services. These services provide for installation of the
 software product by an experienced Digital Software Specialist.

 Customer Responsibilities

 Before Digital installation of the software the customer must:

 o  Have previously installed all requisite hardware including termi-
    nals and SNA gateway products.

 o  Obtain, install, and demonstrate as operational any modems and other
    equipment and facilities necessary to interface to Digital's com-
    munications equipment.

                                  4

 

 o  Have generated, to Digital's satisfaction, any necessary IBM host
    software that will be communicating with the SNA gateway or VMS/SNA
    and the 3270 DS Programming Interface.

 o  Make available for a reasonable period of time, as mutually agreed
    by Digital and the customer, all hardware, communications facil-
    ities, and terminals that are to be used during installation.

 Delays caused by any failure to meet these responsibilities will be
 charged at the prevailing rate for time and materials.

 Successful use of this product requires that:

 o  The customer must be prepared to work with both Digital and IBM sys-
    tems personnel to coordinate the pre-installation activities.

 o  The customer should be capable of modifying IBM component gener-
    ation parameters to support either the SNA gateway or VMS/SNA and
    the 3270 DS Programming Interface.
