 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC/EDI FileBridge for OpenVMS for VAX,  SPD 05.70.00
                Version 1.1
 DESCRIPTION

 DEC/EDI FileBridge provides an optional file based interface for DEC/EDI.
 It is typically delivered in conjunction with Digital provided ser-
 vices as a building block in the implementation of an EDI system. The
 capabilities of FileBridge are:

 o  A sequential flat file interface for DEC/EDI

 o  A table-driven "MAPPER" with a basic set of data manipulation op-
    erators for selected classes of commonly encountered EDI applica-
    tion data. This capability is used to convert data from the appli-
    cation file format to the DEC/EDI Application Programming Inter-
    face (API).

 FEATURES

 FileBridge table development:

 o  Data Specification - During development of Mapping tables, the cus-
    tomer defines the application file structure, and parameters for
    mapping between the application file and the EDI standard through
    a forms-based user interface. From this information, FileBridge gen-
    erates a conversion table that is used to map data from/to the ap-
    plication file formats.

 o  User Defined Mapping - For a variety of source data structures and
    types, FileBridge allows fields to be moved directly to the des-
    tination or to have built-in mathematical/logical/string operations
    to be performed upon the fields. The user interface guides the user
    through this process. Further flexibility is available. The user

    can define and add code through "hooks" for more complex process-
    ing.

 o  Data Definition Extracts - FileBridge extracts EDI standards doc-
    ument definition information from DEC/EDI and, as an option, ap-
    plication file record definitions from CDD/Repository.

 FileBridge Run-time:

 o  Run-time Invocation - FileBridge document processing may be invoked
    either by simple changes to application code (the Callable Inter-
    face) or by using the DCL interface.

 o  DEC/EDI interfacing - For outbound EDI transactions, the applica-
    tion passes a file to FileBridge which reads the file and gener-
    ates the DEC/EDI API calls. For inbound EDI transactions, FileBridge
    reads EDI messages from DEC/EDI and generates the appropriate file
    for the application to access.

 o  Application file I/O - FileBridge accepts/generates customer-defined
    sequential files made up of records containing fixed length fields.
    Each record must contain a record-type field that can be used to
    identify it. (The software documentation notes additional restric-
    tions.)

 o  Data tracking - Messages are tracked between FileBridge and DEC/EDI.
    Tracking identification information may be supplied by the appli-
    cation, either by parameters to the Callable interface or by in-
    cluding it in the customer file records.

 Components of FileBridge:

 o  FileBridge User Interface (UI) - The UI consists of a set of menus
    and forms that allow users to create, modify, and compile FileBridge
    tables.

 o  FileBridge Run-time - The Run-time process uses the information in
    a compiled FileBridge table to map data between the application file
    and the DEC/EDI API. The Run-time process is the core processing
    function within FileBridge.

                                  2

 

 o  Callable File-level Interface - This interface allows users to ini-
    tiate FileBridge processing on a file from within a user written
    program. The program can be written in any language that supports
    the VAX procedure calling conventions.

 o  DEC/EDI Extract - This is a utility that must be run during devel-
    opment of the FileBridge tables to extract DEC/EDI document def-
    initions.

 o  FileBridge Recovery - This process uses the information in the au-
    dit log database to support manual restarting of FileBridge in case
    of an unexpected system shutdown.

 o  FileBridge Tracking - This process generates listings of events from
    the audit database and history files.

 STANDARDS INDUSTRY PRACTICE CONFORMANCE

 There are no established conformance standards for EDI Mappers.

 INSTALLATION

 Digital recommends that a customer's first purchase of this software
 product include Digital Installation Services. These services provide
 for installation of the software product by an experienced Digital Soft-
 ware Specialist.


                                  3

 

 For subsequent purchases of this product only experienced customers
 should attempt installation. Digital recommends that all other cus-
 tomers purchase Digital's Installation Services.

 Customer Responsibilities

 Before installation of the software, the customer must:

 o  Previously have installed all requisite software and hardware in-
    cluding terminals.

 o  Make available for a reasonable period of time, as mutually agreed
    by Digital and the customer, all hardware, communication facili-
    ties, and terminals that are to be used during installation.

    Delays caused by any failure to meet the responsibilities will be
    charged at the then prevailing rate for time and materials.

 These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
 sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
 system environment, configuration, and software options.

 Additional disk space is required depending on the number of Mapping
 tables, performance needs, message size and software options.

 The minimum memory supported is 32 MB. However, the use of this soft-
 ware in conjunction with increased memory capability improves perfor-
 mance. The memory size suggested for most typical hardware configu-
 rations is at least 64 MB.
