           PRODUCT NAME:  DEC VTX,* Version 5.0         SPD 26.57.13

           DESCRIPTION

           DEC VTX[*] is a distributed information retrieval service
           that utilizes a tree structured database through which the
           user navigates by selecting choices from a menu. The con-
           tent of the information consists of full-screen "pages" of
           information supplied by the Information Provider.

           Users can quickly access and peruse online information with
           little or no training. Information can be provided at mul-
           tiple places in a wide-area network and can be accessed from
           anywhere in the network; the end-user does not need to know
           the location of the information. All information sources can
           be interlinked so the user has the impression of working within
           a single enterprise-wide network of information.

           The information contained in the infobase can be prepared
           with WPS-PLUS, TPU, EDT, DECgraph, and DECslide. Documents
           produced with DECwrite, DECchart, DECpresent, or a publish-
           ing application that produces DDIF output (such as Inter-
           leaf® or Pagemaker®) can be stored in a DEC VTX infobase.

           DEC VTX provides the infrastructure for an enterprise-wide
           distributed information retrieval service.

           o  Client/server access to information from video terminals,
              PCs running DOS or Microsoft® Windows[TM], Motif[TM] work-
              stations (VMS and ULTRIX), Apple® Macintosh® PCs, IBM®
              3270 terminals, and Digital Equipment Corporation's DECtalk
              voice synthesizer.

           DEC VTX,* Version 5.0                       SPD 26.57.13


           o  Information may be text, graphics, images, or compound
              documents (CDA-based). It can be retrieved either through
              menus (videotex) or in the Motif clients, using hotspots
              (hypertext).

           o  Contents of the customer's application databases can be
              retrieved in the same manner, through information servers
              developed by customers using the DEC VTX Application Link
              Utilities (VALU).

           Categories of DEC VTX Users:

           1. VTX Subscribers are the end-users of the VTX service; they
              navigate through the infobase, search for specific in-
              formation pages, and can create personal magazines of fre-
              quently accessed information pages.

           2. VTX Information Providers are responsible for providing
              the information pages that comprise the infobase(s) used
              by the VTX service. When the design of the infobase is
              finalized, the service provider assigns the page ranges
              that the Information Provider is responsible for main-
              taining.

           3. VTX Service Providers are responsible for coordinating
              the various roles and functions required to provide a VTX
              service. In addition to designing the infobase structure,
              the service provider supplies the appropriate page ranges
              for the information providers to update and chooses the
              most appropriate information provider tool to use, sets
              up information provider and subscriber accounts, does the
              day-to-day operating of the VTX service, and performs gen-
              eral trouble-shooting activities.

           4. VTX Application Providers are programmers that design and
              create front- and back-end applications that interact with
              DEC VTX. Examples are VALU applications that prompt sub-
              scribers for information through the use of form pages,
              take the input to perform functions outside of the VTX

              service, and then return the subscribers to their usual
              VTX environment.

           VMS Clients and Environment:

           o  VT100-series, VT200-series, VT300-series, and VT400-series
              terminals via DECnet, TCP/IP.

           o  VMS DECwindows Motif client via DECnet, TCP/IP (using Dig-
              ital's VMS/ULTRIX Connection (UCX) layered product.)

           DOS Clients and Environment:

           o  VT300-series character-cell emulation via DECnet or asyn-
              chronous line communications. This allows users to ac-
              cess VTX directly rather than accessing VTX via "termi-
              nal" emulation mode.

           o  MS®-Windows client via DECnet.

           o  Support for Macintosh client can be purchased separately
              from a third-party vendor. See your local Digital Sales
              Representative for ordering information.

           ULTRIX VAX and ULTRIX RISC Clients and Environment:

           o  VTX300-series, character-cell client working against a
              real VT terminal or an emulator such as is provided in
              VMS DECwindows Motif via DECnet, TCP/IP.

           o  X/open curses character-cell emulation. In this mode, the
              client converts the DEC ANSI sequences to suitable curses
              calls.

           o  ULTRIX DECwindows

           o  Motif clients are integrated with LinkWorks, Digital's
              hyperinformation environment, allowing links between dif-
              ferent types of information as well as creating personal
              hotspots.

           o  Point and click from Motif clients, MS-Windows client,
              and DOS CC client.

           o  Enhanced print and save capabilities - VTX pages can be
              printed and saved in several different formats such as
              mail, DEC ANSI, LN03, and lineprinter.

           o  Communications transports - DECnet, Internet (TCP/IP) com-
              munications from ULTRIX Clients, VMS Clients and Asyn-
              chronous (RS232) line communications from DOS Clients.

           o  Customizable keypad to allow users to program their key-
              pads on all platforms without code modifications. This
              eliminates the need for modified TSMs in many cases.

           o  A "Getting Started" Infobase, which contains all the in-
              formation a subscriber needs to use DEC VTX, and exten-
              sive online Help libraries for users involved in creat-
              ing, maintaining, operating, and enhancing a DEC VTX ser-
              vice.

           o  DEC VTX Workbench provides a graphical environment for
              the Information Provider to storyboard, design, build,
              and maintain a VTX infobase. The DEC VTX Workbench In-
              formation Provider can build a complete menu structure
              through a simple pictorial interface.

           o  Concentrator support for X.29 virtual devices, construc-
              tion of X.25-based gateways, concentrator support for 3270-
              class terminals based on the use of the DECnet/SNA Gate-
              way VMS 3270 Data Stream Programming interface and custom-
              written IBM applications.

           o  Context-sensitive keywords allow the use of segmented key-
              word files to allow for keyword matches based on the sub-
              scriber's current page context.

           o  DEC VTX allows the ALL-IN-1 user to access VTX using GOLD
              key mappings for the standard VTX functions. It also al-
              lows for integration with the ALL-IN-1 Interrupt and Scratch-
              pad menus.

           o  Document paginator allows the DEC VTX Information Provider
              to paginate documents for subsequent use by VTXAPMS, VTX-
              UPD, or DEC VTX Workbench. The document paginator allows
              you to paginate WPS-PLUS documents, ASCII files, and DDIF
              files.

           Components

           DEC VTX includes all components necessary for designing, dis-
           tributing, and accessing DEC VTX infobases and applications.
           These components are:

           o  VTX Servers and Operator Utilities

              -  DEC VTX Server (VTXSRV) handles subscriber requests
                 for the pages in an infobase.

              -  VTX Control Utility (VTXCTL) enables communication for
                 the DEC VTX operator with the VTX server, update server,
                 concentrator, DEC VTX Workbench Server, and the VTX
                 application server to start and stop processes.

              -  VTX Account Control Utility (VTXACU) allows creation,
                 modification, deletion, and maintenance of DEC VTX ac-
                 counts.

              -  DEC VTX Workbench Server (VTXWBSRV) controls all DEC
                 VTX Workbench update access to DEC VTX infobases, and
                 performs updates to the infobases. It also enables the
                 user to retrieve and extract pages from the infobase
                 for modification using the DEC VTX Workbench Graph-
                 ical Interface.

              -  VTX Update Server (VTXUPDSRV) is a program that func-
                 tions similarly to the server except that its purpose
                 is to allow selected information providers, using the
                 VTXUPD Utility, to update selected pages from a re-
                 mote node.

              -  VTX Infobase Verification Utility (VTXIVU) performs
                 infobase verification and reports on the infobase struc-
                 ture. VTXIVU enables the user to examine the state of
                 the infobase periodically and identify any discrep-
                 ancies. Optionally, the verification report may con-
                 tain a cross-reference listing of the infobase.

           o  Information Provider Tools

              -  VTX Update Utility (VTXUPD) provides full maintenance
                 capability including creation, modification, and dele-
                 tion of DEC VTX pages in the infobase. The utility of-
                 fers two ways to work: menu mode for first-time or in-
                 frequent users, and command mode for experienced users.
                 This program can operate directly on infobase files
                 or access infobase files through the network using the
                 Update Server.

              -  VTX Automatic Page Management System (VTXAPMS) is an
                 automated tool that assigns/replaces symbolic page ref-
                 erences in VTXAPMS input files with page numbers and
                 dynamically builds index menus.

              -  VTX Workbench Graphical Interface (VTXWBGI) allows the
                 communication of one or more Information Providers with
                 the Workbench Server to create and maintain informa-
                 tion in page and keyword files.

              -  VTX Workbench Command Language (VTXWBCL) allows the
                 Information Provider to generate an infobase automat-
                 ically from large or frequently updated sources, such
                 as manuals and catalogs.

           DEC VTX,* Version 5.0                       SPD 26.57.13


              -  Print queue services allows the Information Provider
                 to prepare different format files, such as DDIF doc-
                 uments, WPS-PLUS documents, and text files for use in
                 the VTX infobase. DEC VTX takes advantage of Digital's
                 standard VMS printing facilities under VMS and PATH-
                 WORKS for VMS. The user can specify the printer des-
                 tination and options.

           o  Concentrator (CON)

              A concentrator is used to control multiple terminals on
              a single node and to concentrate multiple terminal pro-
              gram sessions over a single DECnet link. In addition, a
              concentrator can be used to establish certain terminals
              for VTX use only, so subscribers can do nothing else from
              that terminal.

              LAT support in the Concentrator allows Digital terminals
              and ALL-IN-1 device type terminals connected to termi-
              nal servers to be assigned to the concentrator.

           o  External Link Interface (ELK)

              Link Interface (ELK) is a shareable image of callable rou-
              tines. The ELK routines provide users with the ability
              to create custom-written applications with a subset of
              the DEC VTX protocol capabilities to interact with a DEC
              VTX server and TCP. Applications interfacing with ELK can
              be written in any VMS supported language that complies
              with the VMS calling standard. Interfacing with ELK of-
              fers the full advantage of a wide range of DEC VTX func-
              tions. ELK requires a thorough understanding of software
              development techniques used by the applications program-
              mer.

           o  VTX Application Service (VAS)

              The VTX Application Service (VAS) is a higher level fa-
              cility that uses the ELK interface. The VAS component is


                                       7

 



           DEC VTX,* Version 5.0                       SPD 26.57.13


              a VMS run-time image used to present form, menu, and dis-
              play pages from the host VTX server's infobase as the user-
              interface to one or more transactional applications de-
              fined by the customer. The VAS component can also dynam-
              ically create menu pages that are formatted by the VTX
              client. These transactional videotex applications can be
              defined entirely with VAS or can be distributed with VAS
              communicating to custom-written external applications.
              Application interfaces include DECnet, P.S.I. X.25, and
              DECnet/SNA VMS APPC/LU6.2 Programming Interface.

           o  Remote Update Server Link (RUSL):

              The Remote Update Server Link (RUSL) is a shareable im-
              age of callable routines that are linked into custom-written
              code to create tailored update applications. RUSL appli-
              cations can perform interactive VTX page and keyword ex-
              tractions, updates, additions, and deletions through the
              update server. RUSL applications communicate with the up-
              date server via DECnet.

           o  DEC VTX Documentation

              Documentation on the installation, Service Provider, In-
              formation Provider, and Application Provider are included
              in the Server kit.

           o  Packaging

              All DEC VTX clients are included with the Server and can
              be copied to any node in the network.

           HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

           Processor and/or hardware configuration as specified in the
           System Support Addendum (SSA 26.57.13-x).
