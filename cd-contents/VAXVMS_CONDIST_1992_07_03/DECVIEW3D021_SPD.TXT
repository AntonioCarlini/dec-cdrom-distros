     PRODUCT NAME:  DECview3D for VMS, Version 2.1       SPD 26.95.05

     DESCRIPTION

     DECview3D is a software tool used for display, review, markup,
     analysis and manipulation of engineering graphics created by CAD
     (Computer Aided Design) packages. It combines data translation,
     snapshot generation and LiveLinks to DECwrite Compound Document
     Editor. DECview3D can be used to integrate engineering graphics
     into other applications, or as a standalone tool for display and
     review of those graphics.

     DECview3D runs under VMS DECwindows and adheres to the XUI
     Style Guide. It has the same look and feel as other Digital
     developed DECwindows applications. DECview3D also supports
     graphics terminals such as VT240/241 and VT330/340.

     Features

     Input Translation

     DECview3D can read and translate files that conform to the
     following formats:

     o  IGES (Initial Graphics Exchange Specification)
        DECview3D reads and translates files that conform to the IGES
        V4.0 specification and contain those entity types and forms
        supported by DECview3D.

     o  HP-GL[R] Plot Files
        DECview3D reads and translates HPGL 7475 Plot formatted
        files. All non-shading plotting commands and all non-plotter
        specific initialization and settings commands are supported.

     o  CalComp[R] 960 Files
        DECview3D reads and translates CalComp 960 Plot formatted
        files.

     The list of supported IGES entities, HPGL and CalComp 960 plot
     commands is provided in the DECview3D Reference Manual.

     Display and Manipulation Features

     DECview3D allows the user to create one or many LAYOUTS in a
     DECview3D file. A LAYOUT displays the graphics that have been
     translated into DECview3D and keeps a record of how they were
     manipulated, sized, positioned or annotated during any working
     session. Users can navigate through the LAYOUTS contained in a
     DECview3D file and control the display of the LAYOUT with PAN
     and ZOOM operations.

     Graphics that are translated into DECview3D are displayed in
     VIEWPORTS on a layout. Each layout can contain one or many
     VIEWPORTS. Users control the display of the graphics using a
     selection of PAN, ZOOM and ROTATE operations. Any PAN, ZOOM and
     ROTATE combination can be stored in a user defined VIEW. User
     defined VIEWS can be added to the list of pre-defined VIEWS
     which are available in DECview3D. Pre-defined views are FRONT,
     BACK, LEFT, RIGHT, TOP, BOTTOM, ISOMETRIC and TRIMETRIC. The
     SELECT VIEW command allows the user to apply defined views to a
     graphic in DECview3D.

     The BLANK ENTITY function is used to simplify the display of
     complex 3D wireframe graphics by removing part entities from the
     display. LAYER OPERATIONS allow different layers contained in
     the original CAD graphic to be switched off or on.

     Markup Operations

     Users can annotate or markup layouts with text information
     and graphic objects and symbols. These markups can be moved,
     deleted, copied, or customized by changing specific markup
     attributes.

     Color Support

     Files translated into DECview3D display the original applica-
     tion color definition limited by the capability of the display
     device. The DECview3D color table can be changed by the user to
     alter the display of the translated file. Color changes are re-
     flected in the snapshot file formats, limited by the capability
     of the output device.

     Analysis Functions

     Users can obtain geometry information from the drawing entities
     which can be displayed and reviewed, stored in a text file,
     mailed to other users, or included as a text annotation on a
     DECview3D layout. The SELECTION FILTER can be customized to help
     users control the scope of the entity search.

     o  Part Entity Analysis provides geometry and coordinate infor-
        mation about drawing entites e.g., Lines, Arcs, Polylines.

     o  Distance provides 3D shortest distance and 2D delta values
        between selected Lines, Arcs or Point drawing entities.

     Snapshot Generation

     A SNAPSHOT is a file containing a 2D representation of a speci-
     fied layout, portion of a layout, or selected viewport. It shows
     the drawings and any markups the user has added. Snapshot files
     can be used for producing hardcopies or for integrating into
     other applications. The following snapshot formats are supported
     in DECview3D:

     o  DDIF, Digital's Document Interchange Format

     o  Sixel

     o  ReGIS

     o  HP-GL[R]

     o  Interleaf[TM] ASCII

     o  GKS-metafile

     o  CGM

     o  Tektronix[R] 4014 protocol

     o  Encapsulated PostScript[R]

     o  Color PostScript

     o  Color Encapsulated PostScript

     User Interface

     All DECview3D functions are available through pull down menus or
     through the Application Command Line interface. The Application
     Command Line commands can also to used to record the events
     of a DECview3D session in a script file. Script files can be
     edited and replayed. Users can create their own script file with
     an editor and use it within a DECview3D session. Application
     Command Line commands can be used in initialization files to
     customize the DECview3D session.

     VT Support

     On VT 330/340, the mouse is supported as an input device. Both
     Application Command Line and menu interfaces are supported.

     On VT 240/241, user interaction is through the Application
     Command Line only.

     The user interface also features two levels of help:

     Menu        Menu Help (located in the Main Menu) provides the
                 user with an overview of DECview3D, its functional-
                 ity and generic instructions relating to DECview3D
                 formats and commands.

     General     General Help (available at the VMS level) provides
                 an overview of the system and instructions to run
                 DECview3D.

     LiveLink

     DECview3D can be invoked from the LiveLink capability avail-
     able in DECwrite and DECpresent. With LiveLinks, graphics from
     DECview3D can become part of a DECwrite document and may be
     automatically updated when the document is next edited. These
     updates can be controlled by the user so they occur only when
     desired. Links from DECwrite to DECview3D can be modified or
     deleted.

     DECview3D supports links to external CAD files. If the user
     selects the LINK TO GRAPHIC option, this will ensure that
     the latest version of the external CAD file is always trans-
     lated whenever the DECview3D Layout file is edited. Links from
     DECview3D to external CAD files can be modified or deleted.

     High-Quality Output

     DECview3D provides high-quality output to Digital PostScript
     printers such as the PrintServer 20 and PrintServer 40. In
     addition, it supports, the LN03, LN01S, and LN03 PLUS printers.
