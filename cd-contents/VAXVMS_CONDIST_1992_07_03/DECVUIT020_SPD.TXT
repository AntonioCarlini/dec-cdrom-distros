           PRODUCT NAME:  DEC VUIT (Visual User Interface Tool), SPD
           32.09.01                Version 2.0 for VMS Systems

           DESCRIPTION

           DEC VUIT is an interactive WYSIWYG-style (What-You-See-Is-
           What-You-Get) editor for building Motif[TM] application in-
           terfaces. It is intended for developers experienced in con-
           structing interfaces using Motif or similar windowing sys-
           tems.

           DEC VUIT provides a direct manipulation interface to the OSF
           /Motif[TM] Release 1.1 User Interface Language (UIL). DEC
           VUIT also provides an environment that supports rapid de-
           velopment of graphical user interfaces that are compliant
           with OSF/Motif. Prototype interfaces can be tested, quickly
           modified based on end-user input, and fed directly into the
           development stream. Since DEC VUIT generates industry-standard
           OSF/Motif UIL, not a proprietary presentation description
           language, the interface built using DEC VUIT is portable to
           any other platform that supports the OSF/Motif environment.

           DEC VUIT enables developers to build the interface visually
           instead of writing code. During editing, it uses inherent
           knowledge of widget properties and parent-child relation-
           ships to reduce runtime errors.

           DEC VUIT (Visual User Interface Tool),      SPD 32.09.01
           Version 2.0 for VMS Systems

           Features

           o  Based on industry standards: OSF/Motif Release 1.1 UIL
              and X11/R4 intrinsics; not a proprietary presentation de-
              scription language.

           o  Runs on multiple platforms: VMS and ULTRIX on VAX, UL-
              TRIX on RISC and Sun. UIL generated by DEC VUIT can run
              on any vendor platform that supports the Motif graphi-
              cal user interface, allowing the developer to have Dig-
              ital Equipment Corporation hardware as the development
              platform with multiple targets.

           o  Widget Tree Browser presents the widget hierarchy of the
              interface under construction, allowing the developer to
              navigate and access specific portions of the interface
              for editing purposes.

           o  Uses real widgets, not graphical representations, allow-
              ing developers to see the actual runtime appearance while
              creating or editing interfaces. Developers are constrained
              to legal widget resources.

           o  Accepts user-defined extensions or widgets

              -  Allows users to reuse or incorporate widgets into DEC
                 VUIT and manipulate those widgets just like any other
                 widgets in the OSF/Motif Toolkit.

           o  Offers the advantages of UIL-based interface design:

              -  Provides support for resource lists, named values, and
                 runtime variables (identifiers).

              -  Enforces legal parent-child relationships to avoid run-
                 time errors.

              -  Allows developers to build the interface and the ap-
                 plication separately, without relinking after every
                 change.

           Version 2.0 for VMS Systems

              -  Allows developers to design interfaces that incorpo-
                 rate their own user-defined widgets.

           o  Contains editors for all data types supported by the Mo-
              tif toolkit, including color, font, and icon.

           o  Contains comprehensive, context-sensitive on-line help.
              This is the major source of reference information on the
              product.

           o  Part of the DECwindows Tools Package for Motif

              -  Along with DECwindows Graphical Interface Tools and
                 LinkWorks Developer's Tools, provides advanced devel-
                 opment environment for OSF/Motif application devel-
                 opment.

           o  Generate C application shell

              -  Generates the application shell and callback stubs in
                 C, FORTRAN, Pascal, and Ada programming languages, as
                 well as the build procedure (makefile) for prototyp-
                 ing.

           o  Users can "play" the interface and simulate run-time be-
              havior without leaving a DEC VUIT session.

           o  Support has been added for integer and compound string
              expressions.

           HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

           VAX, MicroVAX, VAXstation, or VAXserver configuration as spec-
           ified in the System Support Addendum (SSA 32.09.01-x).
