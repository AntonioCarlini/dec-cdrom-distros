           PRODUCT NAME:  DEC SoftPC for VMS, Version 3.0        SPD
           32.18.01

           DESCRIPTION

           The SoftPC for VMS software product provides the VAXstation
           user the ability to operate DOS-based software. The SoftPC
           product emulates an IBM® PC/AT® system (real mode only) us-
           ing standard VAX hardware and VMS software. A DOS applica-
           tion functions in the SoftPC environment as it functions on
           an IBM PC/AT providing it does not require special hardware,
           protected mode memory, himem.sys or copy protected diskette.

           DEC Soft PC supports DECwindows as well as the VT220. As such,
           it can be executed on any VMS system and can be displayed
           on a VT220 or either a local or remote DECwindows X Windows
           display station. For example, a VAX 8600 could be used for
           execution and a VAXstation 2000 running the VMS Operating
           System could act as the display. Additionally, it supports
           the DECwindows text cut and paste facility.

           The performance of the SoftPC facility is dependent upon a
           number of factors as well as the speed of the processor upon
           which it executes. A VAXstation 3100/38 system yields slightly
           under 6mhz IBM PC/AT CPU performance with arithmetic appli-
           cations. Graphics applications may be slower.

           Applications used with the SoftPC emulator (except those DOS
           utilities included with the SoftPC software) are not Dig-
           ital licensed, warranted or supported products. The user must
           comply with the terms and conditions of each application soft-
           ware license agreement in effect between the user and ap-
           plication supplier.

           Communications applications may not operate in a like man-
           ner to a real PC. This is due to the differences in signalling
           on the VAX and the PC and the way in which the VAX handles
           interrupts. Many communications programs do work correctly.
           If in doubt it is best to try them before purchasing SoftPC.
