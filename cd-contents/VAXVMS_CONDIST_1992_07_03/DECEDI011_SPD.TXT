           PRODUCT NAME:  DEC/EDI Version 1.1                    SPD
           31.70.01

           DESCRIPTION

           DEC/EDI offers application developers all the facilities nec-
           essary for Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). It enables users
           to electronically exchange structured business documents such
           as Purchase Orders, Dispatch Advice and Invoices with their
           Trading Partners using International, National and Industry-
           specific EDI standards. Extensive communication options are
           also provided to facilitate inter-enterprise communication
           via the use of either EDI VANs or OSI protocols.

           DEC/EDI is a VMS layered product. DEC/EDI consists of the
           following components which provide a complete EDI solution:

           o  DEC/EDI Application Component

           o  DEC/EDI Translation Component

           o  DEC/EDI Communications Component

           o  DEC/EDI Management Component

           DEC/EDI can be configured such that each of these components
           can be located together on the same processor or distributed
           around the enterprise on different processors, using Dig-
           ital's networking products, to provide an enterprise-wide
           EDI system. Multiple copies of these components can also be
           deployed across the enterprise, on different processors to
           implement an EDI system ideally suited for the business needs
           of the Enterprise.

           DEC/EDI Application Component

                                    DIGITAL           September 1991

                                                         AE-PBHLB-TE

 



           DEC/EDI Version 1.1                          SPD 31.70.01


           The Application Component enables the user to integrate ex-
           isting and new applications to DEC/EDI and transfer data to,
           or receive data from, Trading Partners via the DEC/EDI Trans-
           lation Component. It is a programming interface and consists
           of a set of nine callable routines. These routines are in-
           dependent of the EDI standard.

           Working examples of programs in COBOL and BASIC programming
           languages are provided to illustrate how an application pro-
           gram is interfaced to the DEC/EDI system.

           The following features are provided by the Application com-
           ponent:

           o  The ability to define default values for sub-elements and
              data elements to minimize the programming effort

           o  A return value to indicate the success or reason for fail-
              ure of the called routine

           o  Routing functions to enable transmission of data from a
              Translation Component to any number of Application com-
              ponents to facilitate enterprise-wide EDI

           o  Routing functions to enable transmission of data to any
              number of Application Components to facilitate intra-enterprise
              EDI

           o  Event and Error logging

           o  Transparency from communications details

           DEC/EDI Translation Component

           The Translation Component performs the transformation pro-
           cess that converts the user application data definitions re-
           ceived from the Application Component into standard EDI for-
           mats and parses standard EDI formats, received from the Com-
           munications Component, into user defined data definitions.

           The Translation Component provides the following features:

           o  Routing functions to enable transmission of data to any
              number of Communications Components and Application Com-
              ponents

           o  Support for multiple versions of message standards

           o  Compliance checking at Trading Partner level

           o  Trading Partner specific Code Translation

           o  User-selectable control number generation

           o  Test transmissions

           o  Event and Error logging

           An editor is provided which enables users to customize the
           messages, either delivered with the product, or provided through
           the DEC/EDI Message Update Kit, to create new messages for
           industry specific and Trading Partner specific messages based
           on ANSI X12, TDCC, EDIFACT, ODETTE and TRADACOMS[TM] syn-
           tax rules supported by this version of the product.

           Trading Partner agreement details, including the message for-
           mats being used, are recorded in the Trading Partner Pro-
           files. The Translation Service uses the information in the
           Trading Partner Profiles and the Message Data Base to per-
           form compliance checking and to check the validity of the
           transaction.

           The Translation Component provides support for the follow-
           ing EDI standards:

           ANSI X12

           o  Automatic generation of Functional Acknowledgments and
              reconciliation of Functional Acknowledgments

           o  Supports industry specific transactions adhering to the
              ANSI X12 syntax
