     PRODUCT NAME:  PDP-11 Symbolic Debugger/VAX to RSX, Version 2.2
     SPD 26.75.04

     DESCRIPTION

     PDP-11 Symbolic Debugger is a fully symbolic debugger for
     FORTRAN-77 and MACRO-11 programs running on VMS under VAX-11
     RSX. PDP-11 Symbolic Debugger is a tool to aid in locating pro-
     gramming errors in successfully compiled programs that do not
     execute properly.

     PDP-11 Symbolic Debugger runs as a two-task debugger. A small
     portion of the code, necessary to debug applications, is linked
     with the user task and the major portion of the debugger runs as
     a separate task.

     PDP-11 Symbolic Debugger provides access to program symbols
     by reading the symbol table file produced by the task builder.
     PDP-11 Symbolic Debugger can understand symbols produced by
     FORTRAN-77 and MACRO-11.

     Features

     o  DEPOSIT and EXAMINE all data types supported by FORTRAN-77
        (except virtual array elements).

     o  Full tracepoint and breakpoint functionality for monitoring
        the execution of user applications, including the ability
        to delay the activation of a tracepoint or breakpoint until
        after it has been encountered a specified number of times.
        The user also has the ability to specify an action to perform
        on encountering a tracepoint or breakpoint. The user has
        the option to specify conditional tracepoints or breakpoints
        using the WHEN mechanism.

     o  Control of execution using STEP by LINE or INSTRUCTION, STEP
        INTO routines or OVER routines, and the GO command.

     o  Computation of the value of source language expressions or of
        address expressions using the EVALUATE command.

     o  Full support for overlaid code including the ability to
        set tracepoints and breakpoints on locations not currently
        resident. PDP-11 Symbolic Debugger can distinguish among
        multiple copies of modules located at different points in the
        overlay structure.

     o  The ability to drive a debugging session using indirect com-
        mand files and to record the results of a debugging session
        by command logging. PDP-11 Symbolic Debugger can be used
        interactively or in batch mode.

     o  On-line Multi-level Prompting HELP Facility that allows the
        user to receive information about the commands accepted by
        PDP-11 Symbolic Debugger during a debugging session.

     o  DATA-TYPE Table showing languages and their equivalent data
        types in the on-line HELP files.

     o  Indirection of address expressions for examining data struc-
        tures at one level of indirection in only one step.

     At Compile Time

     To enable debugging of FORTRAN-77 programs, the user must spec-
     ify a switch in the compiler command line. This switch specifies
     that the information about the symbols in the FORTRAN-77 appli-
     cation will be put into the object file created by the compiler.

     To enable debugging of MACRO-11 programs, the user must specify
     a switch in the assembler command line. This causes informa-
     tion about the symbols in the assembly language program to be
     available to PDP-11 Symbolic Debugger.

     When taskbuilding the application which will be run under con-
     trol of PDP-11 Symbolic Debugger, the user must modify the
     taskbuilder command line and the overlay description file to
     include the PDP-11 Symbolic Debugger kernel.
