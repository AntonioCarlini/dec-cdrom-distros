 PRODUCT NAME:  DECvoice Software, Version 2.1          SPD 29.97.03

 DESCRIPTION

 The DECvoice Software provides a programming interface to the DECvoice
 hardware (DTC04 and DTCN5/DTC05 options). The DECvoice hardware and
 software has been designed to allow access to the North American tele-
 phone network by voice applications on a VAX platform.

 DECvoice Software supports the following functionality:

 Note: Not all functions are available in all modes. Refer to the Sys-
 tem Support Addendum (SSA 29.97.03-x) for details.

 o  Answers telephone calls

 o  Originates telephone calls

 o  Monitors the progress of telephone calls

 o  Automatically adjusts the volume level of messages

 o  Generates hook-flash signaling that can be used to control certain
    PBX features such as call-transfer capability

 o  Detects and generates DTMF tones (Touchtone[TM])

 o  Records and plays digitized messages in a variety of standardized
    formats

 o  Synthesizes messages from ASCII text

 o  Performs speaker-independent voice recognition of a predefined vo-
    cabulary

 o  Performs speaker-dependent voice recognition of a user-defined vo-
    cabulary

                                                         AE-LZ25D-TE

 

 The telephone network interface can be either analog (tip-ring, RJ11)
 using the DTC04 option or digital (T1, RJ45) using the DTCN5/DTC05 op-
 tions. Refer to SSA 29.97.03-x for details of the network interface
 requirements.

 The text-to-speech synthesis subsystem is comparable to the DECtalk
 family of speech synthesizers. Name pronunciation software enhances
 the pronunciation accuracy of surnames and placenames. A user-defined
 dictionary capability is also provided for alternate pronunciation of
 synthesized text.

 The digitized speech subsystem supports encoding at 64 Kilobits per
 second (Kbps) u-Law, 64 Kbps A-Law, 32 Kbps ADPCM, 24 Kbps ADPCM, 16
 Kbps ADPCM, and 16 Kbps subband.

 Note: Not all encoding methods are available in all modes of operation.
 Refer to SSA 29.97.03-x for details.

 The isolated word recognition software, licensed as part of the base
 kit, and the continuous word recognition software, licensed separately,
 are optimized for native speakers of American English. Both the iso-
 lated word recognition subsystem voice recognition standard templates
 and the optional continuous word recognition subsystem voice recog-
 nition templates contain speaker-independent recognition support for
 the digits zero through nine, and the words "yes," "no," and, as used
 as a substitute for zero, "oh."

 Tools are provided to allow the creation of site and application spe-
 cific isolated word speaker-dependent templates.

 Note: This feature is currently supported on the DTC05 in full-function
 mode, not in multiline mode.

 DECvoice Software provides users with the capability to monitor the
 progress of calls that it originates. Application software can use this
 feature to determine if dial tone, busy signal, ringing, and/or call
 pickup has occurred.
