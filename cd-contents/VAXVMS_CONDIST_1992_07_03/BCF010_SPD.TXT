           PRODUCT NAME:  BASEstar CIMfast for VMS,     SPD 36.31.00
                          Version 1.0

           DESCRIPTION

           BASEstar CIMfast for VMS V1.0 is an application enabler that
           provides the following benefits to BASEstar application de-
           velopers:

           o  Reduced development time

           o  Reduced application complexity

           o  Enhanced software maintainability

           o  Rapid prototyping capability

           CIMfast allows even inexperienced BASEstar application de-
           velopers to create BASEstar applications quickly.

           CIMfast provides a very high level event-driven language es-
           pecially suited for describing highly asynchronous BASEs-
           tar interaction. This language, called the CIMfast Event Lan-
           guage (CEL), has the following features:

           o  Based on an Event/Action paradigm

           o  Can be integrated with existing BASEstar application code

           o  Can be customized by adding user-developed callback func-
              tions

           o  Supports the use of the Language-Sensitive Editor (DEC
              /LSE) for menu-driven program creation

           BASEstar CIMfast for VMS,                   SPD 36.31.00
           Version 1.0

           The CIMfast Event Language allows the user to describe in
           very simple terms what BASEstar Events will be reacted to.
           Example Events are:

           o  Data changes representing the current state of the shop
              floor

           o  A message is received from another BASEstar application

           o  A period of time expires

           For each Event, the user can specify a sequence of Actions
           to be taken when this Event occurs. Example Actions include:

           o  Start or stop a manufacturing device

           o  Write to or read from a manufacturing device's memory

           o  Send a message to another BASEstar application

           o  Call a user-written high level language function

           The CIMfast Event Language provides a wide range of Events
           and Actions that support the typical interaction of an ap-
           plication with BASEstar.

           Development Option

           The BASEstar CIMfast Development option provides users with
           the capability to develop CIMfast applications either us-
           ing the CIMfast Event Language alone or together with a high
           level language.* Also provided with the Development option:

           o  Language Sensitive Editor (DEC/LSE) support for the CIM-
              fast Event Language

           o  Extensive CIMfast Event Language and high level language
              source code examples

           o  All necessary high level language include files

           *  For Version 1.0 of BASEstar CIMfast, only VAX C is sup-
              ported.
