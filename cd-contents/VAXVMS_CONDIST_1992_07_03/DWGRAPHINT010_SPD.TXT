                          for VMS, Version 1.0

           DESCRIPTION

           The DECwindows Graphical Interface Tools are widgets which
           provide advanced programming capabilities for developers of
           applications based on the OSF/Motif[TM], allowing customers
           to easily create graphical WYSIWYG (What-You-See-Is-What-
           Your-Get) applications. This product is available separately
           or as a component of the DECwindows Tools Package for Mo-
           tif[TM] (QP-LAXAA-AA), which provides a set of development
           tools for developers of Motif applications. Also included
           in this package are DEC VUIT V2.0 and LinkWorks Developer's
           Tools V1.0. The application deployment environment for ap-
           plications written using the DECwindows Graphical Interface
           Tools and/or the LinkWorks Developer's Tools is included with
           VMS DECwindows Motif V1.0 at no additional charge.

           DECwindows Graphical Interface Tools consist of:

           Graphical Object Editor (GObE) - A 2D graphics widget which
           allows applications to create and manipulate objects in a
           world coordinate system. GObE supports a full range of dy-
           namic actions including move, zoom, scroll, scale, rotate,
           and rubberband. GObE also provides DDIF (Digital Document
           Interchange Format) support.

           Network Editor (NetEd) - A 2D graphics widget which provides
           the ability to layout networks of nodes and connections. NetEd
           stores network data in its own internal database and pro-
           vides network traversal as well as automatic tree/precedence
           layout. It is designed to be used by applications that need
