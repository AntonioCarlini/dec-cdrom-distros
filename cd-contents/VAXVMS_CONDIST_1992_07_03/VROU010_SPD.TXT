           PRODUCT NAME:  DEC WANrouter 100/500,        SPD 32.98.00
                          Version 1.0 


           DESCRIPTION

           The DEC WANrouter 100/500 provides a Wide Area Network (WAN)
           routing service for nodes on a Local Area Network (LAN). It
           runs on either the DEC MicroServer-SP (DEMSB) or DEC MicroServer
           (DEMSA) hardware units. These combination software/hardware
           packages are known as the DEC WANrouter 100 when running on
           a DEC MicroServer-SP (DEMSB) and DEC WANrouter 500 when run-
           ning on a DEC MicroServer (DEMSA).

           Overview

           The DEC WANrouter 100/500 software provides a network rout-
           ing service for:

           o  DECnet/OSI Phase V nodes

           o  DECnet Phase IV nodes

           o  TCP/IP hosts

           o  OSI-compatible end systems

           These nodes and hosts can be co-located on the same Local
           Area Network as the router or connected to the synchronous
           communications ports of the router. Connections to other routers
           or end-systems can be made:

           o  Locally over the Local Area Network using Ethernet or IEEE
              802.3 protocols

           o  Remotely using modem connections over leased lines us-
              ing either DDCMP or HDLC data link protocols

           DEC WANrouter 100/500, Version 1.0          SPD 32.98.00


           o  Remotely across a Packet Switched Data Network (PSDN) us-
              ing X.25 protocols

           o  Remotely across a Frame Relay network

           The DEC WANrouter 100/500 software image is installed and
           configured on a VAX/VMS, VAX/ULTRIX or RISC/ULTRIX system
           (termed a load host) on the same LAN as the DEC MicroServer
           or DEC MicroServer-SP. This software image is then down-line
           loaded to the hardware unit from the load host.

           The DEC WANrouter 100/500 software can be managed from any
           VMS or ULTRIX end system using the DECnet Network Command
           Language (NCL). Management of the INTERNET functions of the
           software can be performed from any end system supporting the
           Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). A separate data
           tracing utility, available on VMS end systems, assists prob-
           lem solving by tracing data packets as routed by the DEC WAN-
           router 100/500 software.

           DECnet Routing

           The DEC WANrouter 100/500 software implements both the DEC-
           net Phase IV routing algorithms (vector routing) and the DEC-
           net/OSI Phase V routing algorithm (link-state routing) The
           DEC WANrouter 100/500 software supports both intra-area rout-
           ing (Level 1) and inter-area routing (Level 2). The router
           can run either the Phase IV or Phase V routing algorithm in
           either combination at each level.

           Communication with other DECnet end systems or routers over
           the synchronous connections can use either DDCMP, HDLC, X.25
           or Frame Relay data link circuits.

           If the routing circuit costs are set appropriately, the DEC
           WANrouter 100/500 software performs path splitting. Note that
           routing cost is an arbitrary network management parameter
           set by the network manager to control network traffic flow.
           If the cost between the router and the destination node is

           the same on multiple synchronous circuits, then the DEC WAN-
           router 100/500 software splits the traffic across the cir-
           cuits.

           INTERNET Routing

           The DEC WANrouter 100/500 software provides routing support
           for TCP/IP hosts on the same LAN as the router. IP datagrams
           can be forwarded to remote TCP/IP hosts within the same IN-
           TERNET domain, or to other INTERNET domains connected by an
           INTERNET gateway.

           Routing of IP datagrams through the network uses the Dual
           IS-IS routing protocol as specified in RFC 1195 to commu-
           nicate reachability of TCP/IP hosts.

           Note: All routers on the path between the TCP/IP hosts must
           support IP routing using the Dual IS-IS protocol. Within an
           area, all routers on all paths (including alternate paths)
           must support the Dual IS-IS routing protocol. Between ar-
           eas, the same restriction applies but only to the Level 2
           routers.

           IP hosts on the same Ethernet Local Area Network as the router
           are identified by the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) as
           described in RFC 826. IP datagrams can be forwarded over CSRA
           /CD (using Ethernet format packets), DDCMP, HDLC, X.25 data
           link or Frame Relay circuits. In addition, IP Reachable Ad-
           dresses can also be manually configured over these synchronous
           data link circuits. When using X.25 data links, only stat-
           ically assigned circuits are supported; forwarding of IP data-
           grams over X.25 Dynamically Assigned (DA) circuits is not
           supported.

           Forwarding of IP datagrams to and from other IP routing do-
           mains through other IP routers is supported only on the same
           LAN. Routing information is exchanged with other IP routers
           on the LAN using the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) as
           described in RFC 1058. IP routers which do not support RIP
           can also be supported by making use of manually configured

                                       3

           IP Reachable Addresses. The use of RIP over the synchronous
           data link circuits is not supported.

           OSI Routing

           The DEC WANrouter 100/500 software fully implements the re-
           quirements of an OSI Intermediate System. The DEC WANrouter
           100/500 exchanges information about reachability of end sys-
           tems using the OSI Intermediate System to Intermediate Sys-
           tem (IS-IS) Intra-Domain Routing Exchange Protocol as spec-
           ified in ISO DIS 10589. OSI-compatible end systems on the
           same Local Area Network can exchange information with the
           router using the OSI End System to Intermediate System (ES-
           IS) Routing Exchange Protocol as specified in ISO 9542.

           The DEC WANrouter 100/500 software uses the OSI Connection-
           less Network Protocol (CLNP) as specified in ISO 8473 to com-
           municate with OSI-compatible systems over an ISO 8802/3 or
           IEEE 802.3 Local Area Network. Communication over the syn-
           chronous links uses either the HDLC or the X.25 packet-level
           protocols. X.25 Routing Circuits

           The DEC WANrouter 100/500 software supports the use of stat-
           ically and dynamically assigned X.25 routing circuits. Static
           circuits are established when the routing circuit is enabled
           and remain set up until the routing circuit is disabled. Dy-
           namically assigned circuits are established only when there
           is information to send over the routing circuit. They are
           disconnected when there is no further information to send.

           When running on the DEC WANrouter 500, the software supports
           more than one connection to an X.25 PSDN, although each con-
           nection must have a unique DTE address. The router can share
           outgoing calls between all the DTEs connected to a PSDN. The
           DEC WANrouter 100/500 software supports routing over either
           Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVC[R]s) or Switched Virtual Cir-
           cuits (SVCs).

           DEC WANrouter 100/500, Version 1.0          SPD 32.98.00


           The DEC WANrouter 100/500 software supports connections over
           Frame Relay data links as specified in the Frame Relay Spec-
           ification jointly developed by Digital Equipment Corpora-
           tion, Stratacom[R], Inc., Northern Telecom NT[R], and Cisco Sys-
           tems Inc. Multiple virtual circuits can be multiplexed over
           a single Frame Relay link using the Data Link Control Iden-
           tifier (DLCI) field of the Frame Relay header. For details
           of the Frame Relay options implemented, refer to the Sys-
           tem Support Addendum (SSA 32.98.00-x)

           When configured to operate with Frame Relay data links, the
           DEC WANrouter 100/500 software cannot make use of any other
           data links such as DDCMP, HDLC or X.25. A separate media and
           documentation kit is required to allow operation with Frame
           Relay data links.

           Installation and Configuration

           The minimum configuration requires one host to load the DEC
           MicroServer or DEC MicroServer-SP, although the DEC WANrouter
           100/500 software can be installed on a number of load hosts.
           This helps users to protect against loss of service if a sin-
           gle load host is unavailable, or unable to load the system
           for any other reason. Each load host must be on the same LAN
           as the router.

           Installation is performed using VMSINSTAL (on VMS) or setld
           (on ULTRIX). The software must be configured using two con-
           figuration programs supplied with the product. These con-
           figuration programs allow the network manager to set up the
           down-line load database and to define the routing circuits.
           Management

           Permanent changes to the configuration of the DEC WANrouter
           100/500 software can be made by using the configuration util-
           ities to create a script file and then rebooting the hard-
           ware unit. Temporary changes to the configuration of the DEC
           WANrouter 100/500 software can be made by using the DECnet

           DEC WANrouter 100/500, Version 1.0          SPD 32.98.00


           Network Command Language (NCL) from any available end sys-
           tem. These temporary changes are lost when the hardware unit
           is rebooted.

           Other management tasks can also be be performed using NCL,
           allowing the network manager to:

           o  Manage specific connections (for example: set up the data
              links, enable and disable circuits)

           o  Monitor network traffic (for example: enable event log-
              ging, display counters)

           o  Resolve problems (for example: test circuit availabil-
              ity, perform loopback tests, dump memory contents)

           An additional utility called Common Tracing Facility (CTF)
           is available on the VMS load host to assist with problem solv-
           ing by tracing data packets at various stages in its path
           through the router.

           Information about IP variables held on the DEC WANrouter 100
           /500 can also be accessed by Network Management systems us-
           ing the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). DEC WAN-
           router 100/500 implements the Management Information Base
           (MIB-I) variables which can be read by any SNMP agent.

           Note: Support is not provided for modifying these variables
           from an SNMP agent.

           Physical Line Support

           The DEC MicroServer (DEMSA) and DEC MicroServer-SP (DEMSB)
           hardware units contain an Ethernet interface port (IEEE 802.3
           compatible) and one or four synchronous communications ports.
           The DEC MicroServer has four synchronous communications ports
           and the DEC MicroServer-SP has a single synchronous commu-
           nications port. Both hardware units are supplied as table-
           top units, but also can be wall- or rack-mounted in a stan-
           dard 19-inch rack.

           Communication over the synchronous lines is full- or half-
           duplex, and full modem control is supplied on all synchronous
           line(s). The synchronous port(s) can operate as DDCMP point-
           to-point or multipoint links, HDLC point-to-point links, X.25
           LAPB/LAPBE links or Frame Relay LAPD data links. On DDCMP
           multipoint links, the DEC WANrouter 100/500 can act only as
           a tributary station.

           The product supports V.24 interchange circuits with the fol-
           lowing electrical interfaces: V.28 (RS232-D), RS232-C, V.36
           /V.11 (RS449/RS422), V.10 (RS449/RS423), and V.35. It also
           supports CCITT (1980) X.21 for leased line services only.
           The number of lines supported depends on the hardware unit,
           the electrical interface type, and the maximum line speed
           in use (see Table 1).

           Actual line utilization is dependent on many factors such
           as average packet size and protocol overhead. See the Per-
           formance section of this SPD for guidelines on expected line
           utilization at the above speeds.

           Adapter cables provide the necessary interchange circuits
           for each synchronous line. Refer to the System Support Ad-
           dendum (SSA 32.98.00-x) for further information on the re-
           quired adapter cables.

           The DEC MicroServer-SP and DEC MicroServer always require
           an external clock source (such as a modem).

           When used with T1 or G.703 lines, the additional require-
           ments for operation of the DEC MicroServer are as follows:

           o  The DEC MicroServer supports only clear channel inter-
              faces. Connection to a T1 or G.703 line requires a V.35
              /RS422 to T1/G.703 DSU/CSU converter to provide framing
              to meet CCITT G.704. The DEC MicroServer does not pro-
              vide either T1 framing pulses or separate channels for
              64 Kbits/s control data for G.703.

           o  The DEC MicroServer does not guarantee line density. T1
              links can offer only 1.536 Mbits/s or 1.344 Mbits/s rates.
              1.536 Mbits/s rates require the DSU/CSU converter to of-
              fer B8ZS and the line to accept bipolar violations. 1.334
              Mbits/s rates require the DSU/CSU converter to offer B7.

           o  Transmit clocking should be provided by the DCE, CCITT
              114. The DEC MicroServer uses CCITT 114 to clock data out
              of the DTE, and will source a CCITT 113 transmit clock.
              CCITT 113 should be used by the DCE to receive the trans-
              mit data. The DEC MicroServer implements CCITT 113 as a
              buffered version of CCITT 114. This clocking scheme en-
              sures both network synchronization and minimized skew be-
              tween the clock and data for a range of cable lengths and
              parameters.

           If the above transmit clocking mechanism is not provided by
           the DCE, this DCE must provide a method of adjusting the phase
           of the clock used to sample the data with respect to that
           supplied to the DTE. This requires that the DCE provide test
           points to allow analysis of the clock and data waveforms and
           that this adjustment is performed on installation, and af-
           ter any subsequent alteration of the connection cable. This
           alternative method is also required for DCEs utilizing the
           X.21 interface.

           Network Size and Supported Circuits

           DECnet Phase IV networks are hierarchical networks that can
           be segmented into up to 63 areas, each containing up to 1023
           nodes.

           Note: These are maximum values permitted by the Digital Net-
           work Architecture, satisfactory operation in large networks
           requires proper network planning.

           DECnet/OSI Phase V domains can be virtually unlimited. How-
           ever, the actual size of a domain is limited by the prod-
           uct's memory size and processor power. Table 2 lists the val-
           ues of the parameters used to determine the size of the sup-
           ported network.

           connections.  Some end systems may have more than one connection 
           to the router, in which case, the number of end systems 
           supported in an area will be less than 3000.        
   
           Public Networks Supported

           Refer to the System Support Addendum (SSA 32.98.00-x) for

           Performance

           The actual packet rate will be less than indicated by the
           aggregate synchronous line speed, and is determined by such
           factors as:

           o  Type of traffic (routing updates or data packets) and data
              rates

           o  Proportion of leased line to X.25 traffic

           o  The path of messages passing through the product (synchronous-
              to-synchronous, synchronous-to-LAN, or LAN-to-LAN)

           o  Communications line characteristics

           o  Frequency and type of errors on the synchronous links

           o  Network topology

           o  Protocol overhead

           When using line speeds above 384 Kbps, full line saturation
           is achievable with average packet sizes above 512 bytes. The
           minimum, average packet size required to achieve full line
           saturation with full duplex operation is given in Table 3.
