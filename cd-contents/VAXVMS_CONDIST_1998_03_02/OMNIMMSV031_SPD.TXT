 PRODUCT NAME:   DEComni MMS                            SPD 47.89.03
                  Version 3.1

 DESCRIPTION

 DEComni MMS is a network communication product that provides a solu-
 tion for the connection and management of manufacturing/utility con-
 trol devices and systems. DEComni MMS implements the Manufacturing Mes-
 sage Specification (MMS), ISO/IEC 9506-1 and ISO/IEC 9506-2. When com-
 bined with prerequisite hardware and software, DEComni MMS interop-
 erates with other systems supporting the Manufacturing Message Spec-
 ification ISO/IEC9506-1 and ISO/IEC 9506-2 specifications.

 Features

 DEComni MMS is an implementation of the Manufacturing Message Spec-
 ification (MMS), ISO/IEC 9506. It relies upon the DEComni API prod-
 uct that provides a high level applications programming interface (API)
 with a high degree of functionality built in. The interface is easy
 to use and requires very little support code. For more information,
 please refer to the DEComni API Software Product Description (SPD 47.88.xx).

 Alternatively, DEComni MMS can be integrated with the BASEstar Open
 Server product (SPD 47.87.xx) for connection to plant devices which
 use the MMS protocol.

 DEComni MMS provides, as a minimal set, the Client Conformance require-
 ments for the services specified in MAP Implementation Class MAP3.

 The product is able to connect to those devices that have implemented
 to ISO/IEC 9506 (MMS).

 CONFORMANCE TO STANDARDS

 The conformance of DEComni MMS software to OSI standards is specified
 in Appendix A of this SPD.

 INSTALLATION

 Only experienced customers should install DEComni MMS software. DIG-
 ITAL recommends that all other customers purchase DIGITAL Installa-
 tion Services. These services provide for installation of the soft-
 ware product by an experienced DIGITAL software specialist.

 Installation steps for DEComni MMS consists of the following:

 o  Verification that all components of DEComni MMS have been received

 o  Verification that the necessary versions of the prerequisite soft-
    ware and documentation are available

 o  Verification of the appropriate system parameters

 o  Verification that the system meets the minimum hardware and soft-
    ware requirements as specified in this SPD

 o  Installation of the DEComni MMS software by creating the necessary
    directories and by copying the software from the distribution me-
    dia

 o  Verification that DEComni MMS has been installed correctly by us-
    ing the IVP

 DEComni MMS Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)

 The DEComni MMS IVP performs a series of tests to verify proper in-
 stallation.

 of 32 bits is supported.

 Note 2:

 The effective length for strings is limited by the maximum PDU size.
 See Note 8.

 Note 3:

 Date and Time are supported. Support for Time Sequence Identifier is
 N/A.

 Note 4:

 Read and Write indications are delivered to user written code and thus
 uninterruptible access is application dependent.

                                 13

 

 The syntax and semantics for file name are specified by the OpenVMS
 operating system. This is documented in the OpenVMS documentation un-
 der "Full File Specification". Wildcard specifiers are not permitted.

 The file name must be specified in the first graphic string of the File-
 Name production. Any information in additional graphic strings will
 be ignored.

 Note 6:

 The range is 1-infinity. Acceptance of indications is under program-
 ming control. The actual number of outstanding requests allowable is
 dependent upon process memory limits which is set by either the pro-
 grammer or system manager.

 Note 7:

 This implementation does not specify additional code nor additional
 detail in error type.

 Note 8:

 The following semantics are defined for the use of the local detail
 calling/called fields. As a result, a limit is set for a maximum MMS
 PDU size, which limits specific functions.

 The semantics of this field are contained in the implementation agree-
 ments of the NIST (National Institute for Standards and Technology -
 OSE Implementor's Workshop) Special Publication 500-214 titled Sta-
 ble Implementation Agreements for Open Systems Interconnection Pro-
 tocols, Version 7, Edition 1, December 1993, Part 20 (MMS) Sections
 8.2.0.3 and 8.2.0.4.

 Note 9:

 The optional parameter of Event Actions on an Event Enrollment is not
 supported.
