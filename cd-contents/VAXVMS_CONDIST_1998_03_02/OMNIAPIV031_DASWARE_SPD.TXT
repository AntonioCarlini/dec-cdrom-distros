 PRODUCT NAME:   DIGITAL DASware V3.1                      SPD 60.46.03

 DESCRIPTION

 DASware is a general device connect product that contains the follow-
 ing DIGITAL DAS modules:

 o  Device Access Software for RS232 (OpenVMS, DIGITAL UNIX, Windows
    NT and HP-UX systems)

 o  Device Access Software for TCP/IP (DIGITAL UNIX, Windows NT and HP-
    UX systems)

 o  Device Access Software for OSI Transport Layer (DIGITAL UNIX and
    HP-UX systems)

 Each DASware module allows BASEstar Open users and DEComni applica-
 tions to exchange data with partner applications or devices in a protocol-
 independent way through a specific Transport Network.

 Individual DASware modules do not implement protocols and services for
 the specific Transport Network. They provide a transport level inter-
 face to higher level applications which implement the specific pro-
 tocol for the device to be connected.

 The main function of a DASware module is to adapt the interface of the
 Transport Product specific to your platform to the BASEstar Open ser-
 vices and DEComni API.

                                                          April 1997

                                                         AE-4NGAC-TE

 

 BASEstar Open Data Services provide device-independent access to data
 allowing users to exchange data with partner applications or devices
 simply by getting and putting the value of one or more Device_Data_
 Points. DEComni API applications can perform the same functions through
 the DEComni Application Programming Interface (API).

 The DEComni API (with DASware) is supported on OpenVMS, DIGITAL UNIX
 and HP-UX platforms.
