 PRODUCT NAME:  DECADMIRE V2.1A                         SPD 52.65.02

 DESCRIPTION

 DECADMIRE is an application development environment that generates high-
 performance commercial applications. Rapid application development method-
 ologies (prototyping, code templates, screen and code generation) are
 used to build reliable, production applications.

 DECADMIRE employs rapid application development (RAD) methodologies
 through the use of templates, which allow you to quickly design, test,
 and implement client/server applications. Applying this to systems de-
 velopment in fast-changing environments provides interactive devel-
 opment that supports work review at each cycle, provides independence
 of design from implementation, and consistent coding behavior and ap-
 pearance of the generated application.

 DECADMIRE can generate timesharing, generic (ODBC), specialized high-
 performing ODBC, client/server, classic transaction processing, dis-
 tributed client/server, or continuous fault tolerant applications.

 Development is supported in both the Microsoft Windows [TM] (DECAD-
 MIRE for Visual Basic product) and the VT (DECADMIRE product) devel-
 opment environments. DECADMIRE is capable of building applications based
 on interactive presentations services (DECforms or Microsoft Visual
 Basic®).

 Visual Basic applications using generic ODBC can be deployed on any
 platform with a supporting ODBC database. Visual Basic applications
 using specialized ODBC can be deployed with Oracle Rdb[TM], MS SQL SERVER,
 Oracle®, or MS ACCESS. The transaction processing or fault tolerant
 applications can be deployed in an OpenVMS environment. The specific
 type of application is dependent upon middleware selections made in

 the DECADMIRE application design and is reflected in the generated ap-
 plication. Components Overview

 DECADMIRE has two major components that allow the user to create an
 application: the DECADMIRE BUILDER and the DECADMIRE GENERATOR.

 DECADMIRE BUILDER

 The BUILDER allows the application developer to interactively deter-
 mine the application structure and the appearance of the forms asso-
 ciated with the application. This logical application definition is
 stored in a shared database for all types of applications (Windows or
 VT based).

 The developer can also simulate how the application works, including
 database operations against the server, without actually generating
 any executable code. Visual Basic is utilized to simulate the appli-
 cation in the Windows environment. Existing data definitions can be
 imported or cloned into DECADMIRE to be used as an application design
 base.


 DECADMIRE GENERATOR

 The GENERATOR generates the application code for the appropriate plat-
 form and environment paradigms that you choose. In the VT environment
 the generator is utilized once prototyping is completed. In the Win-
 dows environment, the Visual Basic form, basic code, and the make files
 are generated before prototyping is completed using Visual Basic. The
 same generator process is utilized to generate all variations of ap-
 plications.

 The source code for the application is produced by the GENERATOR. The
 result of this generation is an integrated application based on code
 for standard Digital layered products and Microsoft's Visual Basic.
 This code can be modified, enabling additional features or customiza-
 tions to be added to the application. The code contains markers, which
 delimit portions of the code that will be updated during regeneration


                                  2

 

 from changes made in the BUILDER. Code modifications placed outside
 of these markers are not changed. The latest version of the source code
 can be used for regeneration, capturing all customizations.

 Timesharing applications can scale to TP by specifying ACMS during re-
 generation (ACMS license required). The specific language and DECforms
 are exactly the same in both applications, preserving all modifica-
 tions. The language driver code is replaced with an ACMS task and other
 ACMS components. An object library with some generic routines is used
 during the linking of the application.

 Visual Basic based applications can be generated using a choice of mid-
 dleware (ODBC, specialized ODBC, or ACMS). The Visual Basic Form and
 logic remains the same regardless of the middleware or type of appli-
 cation selected and will utilize the same ACMS server components if
 selected.

 DECADMIRE for Visual Basic components

 DECADMIRE for Visual Basic is comprised of three main components:

 1. DECADMIRE development environment, which provides a default appli-
    cation architecture that includes forms, icons, workflow, flexi-
    ble and modifiable code templates, and a complete environment used
    in conjunction with Visual Basic to define, generate, test, and cus-
    tomize the application. One or many projects can be set up to com-
    plete development.

    Each project can have custom MDI forms, middleware, or ODBC Server
    type. Specific MDI form options can be assigned to each project in-
    cluding setting up a toolbar, status bar, or tooltips. Each project
    must have either ODBC or ACMS Desktop as the middleware. Each ODBC
    project must select a specialized or generic.

    Under the VIEW option developer preferences can be selected which
    enable you to set up your environment to utilize tool tips, one,
    two, or zero tool bars, a menu bar, colors, and default startup con-
    figurations.


                                  3

 


    File services must be used to access a common shared application
    design base. A product equivalent to Digital's PATHWORKS must be
    used along with an ODBC driver.

 2. DECADMIRE utilities provide tools to set up the development envi-
    ronment by dataset (application design database), including the cre-
    ation of dataset, definition of developers who are authorized to
    use the environment, application messages, and reserved words.

 3. DECADMIRE online information system provides both conceptual and
    task-based information to help the developer learn and complete the
    steps needed for application development. The online information
    system provides Help, a Tutorial, and Job Aids.

    Help provides comprehensive information about the options, menus,
    and screens in the development environment.

    The Tutorial provides practice of the tasks you must perform to de-
    velop an application.

    The Job Aids provide step-by-step instructions to perform specific
    tasks in DECADMIRE. Job aids can be printed out for easy reference.

 ODBC

 DECADMIRE has specialized ODBC for high-performance processing includ-
 ing the support of transaction handling (TRANS), handling of read com-
 mitted transactions (RCOMM), handling of output parameters from stored
 procedures (OUTPRM), handling of conversion of strings to numeric columns
 (CHRNUM), support for API functions; "SQLExtendedFetch" (EXTFCH), "SQLDe-
 scribeParam" (DSCPRM), "SQLNumParams" (NUMPRM).

 DECADMIRE Application Development Process

 Database Design/Description (Generic for VT or Windows development)

 DECADMIRE allows the user to start either by importing database in-
 formation into the dictionary or manually entering this information
 using the dictionary maintenance facility. A review of all informa-
 tion entered or imported should be completed with either the dictio-
 nary maintenance tool or reports before continuing prototyping and code
 generation.

 Relationships among tables are defined by associating like data items,
 which comprise parent-child and related table descriptions. All screen
 and form development, report development, prototyping, and code gen-
 eration are based on the dictionary information. A copy table func-
 tion is provided to enhance development efforts.

 Application Design (Generic for VT or Windows development)




                                  5

 

 Each function performed by the application is designed as a module.
 Each module is associated with predefined templates (building block
 objects), which associate a specific series of actions to be processed
 within the application. Definition of the form is completed by select-
 ing data to be on the form, and associating business logic with the
 data. Automatic screens (VT) and Visual Basic forms (Windows) are gen-
 erated for the developer to use for prototyping or customizing.

 The DECADMIRE building block objects can be customized for each ap-
 plication's needs; however, modifications must follow the rules for
 each building block. Customizations made within the DECADMIRE build-
 ing blocks are included in the generated code. Removal of the code mark-
 ers in the building blocks is not supported.

 Prototyping DECADMIRE for Visual Basic (Windows development)

 Prototyping is completed after the Define Form and Code for a design
 module has been completed. Prototyping is completed using the Visual
 Basic Professional Edition, which is accessed from within the DECAD-
 MIRE development environment. The Visual Basic Run command is utilized
 to test the application against the development database used for pro-
 totyping. All customizations made to the application forms and logic
 are operational during the prototyping session. Prototyping (VT de-
 velopment)

 After the user defines the database and creates the modules that de-
 fine menus, screens, and reports, the application can be simulated us-
 ing prototyping.

 Prototyping can be completed for a single module (menu, report, or screen),
 a grouping of modules, or the entire application. Prototyping of a mod-
 ule that makes a call to other modules automatically includes all re-
 lated modules in the prototyping session. Data can be entered, retrieved,
 and updated, using the DECADMIRE BUILDER data structure, simulating
 the final application based on a test or existing Oracle Rdb database.





                                  6

 

 Prototyping closely mimics the completed application. However, some
 inconsistencies within the prototyping environment are not in the fi-
 nal generated application. Customizations made to the generated code
 are not operational in the prototyping.
