 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC VTX Version 6.2 for OpenVMS VAX     SPD 26.57.16

 DESCRIPTION

 DEC VTX[TM] for OpenVMS[TM] VAX[TM] is a distributed document filing
 and retrieval system. The server runs on the OpenVMS Operating Sys-
 tem, while the clients run on any OpenVMS, ULTRIX[TM] or MS-DOS[R] sys-
 tem with either DECnet[TM] or TCP/IP (except for the MS-DOS and Mac-
 intosh clients) as the transport to the server.

 DEC VTX Text Retrieval System is now merged with DEC VTX for OpenVMS
 VAX to form one product. All multilanguage capabilities of this prod-
 uct are part of the standard DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX. The PC client
 (TeamLinks Library Services for Microsoft[R] Windows[TM] (SPD 52.62.xx)
 and Macintosh client (TeamLinks Library Services for Macintosh (SPD
 54.18.xx) are available separately.

 Text Retrieval functionality provides a search mechanism to access in-
 fobase pages. Using text retrieval, users can find and retrieve doc-
 uments where a match to a specified search query is found. Text re-
 trieval extends the storage retrieval capabilities of DEC VTX for Open-
 VMS VAX to include full indexing of existing ISO-1 (ANSI) documents
 and retrieval of these documents using "full text search".

 DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX is designed to allow users to quickly access
 and peruse online information easily. Information can be provided at
 multiple places in a wide area network and accessed from anywhere in
 the network; the end user does not need to know the location of the
 information. All information sources can be interlinked so the user
 has the impression of working within a single enterprisewide network
 of information.

 Infobases can store a variety of document types, ranging from text to
 compound documents containing charts, images, and graphics. These doc-
 uments can be printed or viewed online if the appropriate viewer or
 application is present. Launchable pages provide a means to activate
 other applications, such as Excel[R] or WordPerfect[TM], from within
 DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX. There are no limitations on the type of in-
 formation that can be stored in a launchable page, or on the type of
 application a launchable page can start.

 DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX provides the infrastructure for an enterprisewide
 distributed text retrieval system as follows:

 o  Client/server access to information from video terminals, PCs run-
    ning DOS, Motif[R] workstations (OpenVMS and ULTRIX), IBM[R] 3270
    terminals and Apple[R] computers.

 o  Information may be in any format. It can be retrieved either through
    menus (videotex), full text search or keywords.

 o  Contents of the customer's application databases can be retrieved
    through information servers developed by customers using back-end
    APIs in DEC VTX.

 Information can be retrieved by a variety of query techniques, includ-
 ing:

    o  Search by words, phrases, stems, title, keyword

    o  Wildcard search expressions - single character or many charac-
       ters

    o  Boolean expressions (AND, OR, and NOT)

    o  Proximity and Field searching ("DEC AND VAX IN SENTENCE")

    o  Date range searches of documents created before or after a spec-
       ified date

    o  Ability to select indexes to search, including indexes not vis-
       ible by default

    o  Query Menus: Menu choices can point to Query pages that can be
       useful predefined queries

                                  2

 

    o  Videotex menus

 Many of the query techniques present documents with search terms high-
 lighted in context and partial results are returned while long queries
 continue. In addition, the text retrieval functionality provides the
 ability to override default stemming by requesting "exact matches".

 Categories of DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX Users:

 1. Subscribers are the end-users of the DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX ser-
    vice; they navigate through the infobase, search for specific in-
    formation pages, and create personal repositories of frequently ac-
    cessed information.

 2. Information Providers are responsible for maintaining the infor-
    mation pages that comprise the infobase(s) used by DEC VTX for Open-
    VMS VAX.

 3. Service Providers are responsible for coordinating the various roles
    and functions required to provide a DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX sys-
    tem. In addition to designing the infobase structure, the Service
    Provider performs the following tasks:

    o  Supplies the appropriate page ranges for the information providers
       to update

    o  Chooses the most appropriate information provider tool to use

    o  Sets up information provider and subscriber accounts

    o  Maintains the day-to-day operation of the DEC VTX for OpenVMS
       VAX system

    o  Performs general trouble-shooting activities

 4. Application Providers are programmers that design and create front
    and back-end applications that interact with DEC VTX for OpenVMS
    VAX. Examples are applications that prompt subscribers for infor-
    mation through the use of form pages, take the input to perform func-
    tions outside of DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX and return the subscribers
    to the usual DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX environment.

 Components

 DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX includes all components necessary for design-
 ing, distributing, and accessing DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX infobases and
 applications. The components are as follows:

 o  Servers and Operator Utilities

    -  DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX server (VTXSRV) handles subscriber re-
       quests for the pages in an infobase.


                                  5

 

    -  DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX Control Utility (VTXCTL) enables com-
       munications for the DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX operator with the
       DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX server, content-based retrieval subsys-
       tem, update server, concentrator, DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX Work-
       bench server, and the DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX application server
       to start and stop processes.

    -  DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX Account Control Utility (VTXACU) allows
       creation, modification, deletion, and maintenance of DEC VTX for
       OpenVMS VAX accounts.

    -  DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX Workbench server (VTXWBSRV) controls all
       DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX Workbench update access to DEC VTX for
       OpenVMS VAX infobases and performs updates to the infobases. It
       also enables the user to retrieve and extract pages from the in-
       fobase for modification using the DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX Work-
       bench Graphical Interface.

    -  DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX Update server (VTXUPDSRV) is a program
       that functions similarly to the server except that its purpose
       is to allow selected information providers, using the VTXUPD Util-
       ity, to update selected pages from a remote node.

    -  DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX Infobase Verification Utility (VTXIVU)
       performs infobase verification and reports on the infobase struc-
       ture. VTXIVU enables the user to examine the state of the in-
       fobase periodically and identify any discrepancies. Optionally,
       the verification report may contain a cross-reference listing
       of the infobase.

 o  Information Provider Tools

    -  DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX Update Utility (VTXUPD) provides full
       maintenance capability including creation, modification, and dele-
       tion of DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX pages in the infobase, and man-
       agement of content-based retrieval indexes. The utility offers
       two ways to work: menu mode for first-time or infrequent users,
       and command mode for experienced users. This program can oper-
       ate directly on infobase files or access infobase files through
       the network using the Update server.

                                  6

 

    -  DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX Automatic Page Management System (VTX-
       APMS) is an automated tool that assigns/replaces symbolic page
       references in VTXAPMS input files with page numbers and dynam-
       ically builds index menus.

    -  DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX Workbench Graphical Interface (VTXWBGI)
       allows the communications of one or more Information Providers
       with the Workbench server to create and maintain information in
       page and keyword files.

    -  DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX Workbench Command Language (VTXWBCL) al-
       lows the Information Provider to generate an infobase automat-
       ically from large or frequently updated sources, such as man-
       uals and catalogs.

    -  Print queue services allow the Information Provider to prepare
       different format files, such as DDIF documents, WPS-PLUS doc-
       uments, and text files for use in the DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX
       infobase. DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX takes advantage of Digital's
       standard OpenVMS printing facilities under OpenVMS and PATHWORKS[TM]
       for VMS. The user can specify the printer destination and op-
       tions.

 o  Concentrator (CON)

    A concentrator is used to control multiple terminals on a single
    node and to concentrate multiple terminal program sessions over a
    single DECnet link. In addition, a concentrator can be used to es-
    tablish certain terminals solely for the purpose of DEC VTX for Open-
    VMS VAX use.

    LAT support in the Concentrator allows Digital[TM] terminals and
    ALL-IN-1 device type terminals connected to terminal servers to be
    assigned to the concentrator.

 o  External Link Interface (ELK)

    The External Link Interface (ELK) is a shareable image of callable
    routines. The ELK routines provide users with the ability to cre-
    ate custom-written applications with a subset of the DEC VTX for
    OpenVMS VAX protocol capabilities to interact with a DEC VTX for

                                  7

 

    OpenVMS VAX server and subscriber client. Applications interfac-
    ing with ELK can be written in any OpenVMS-supported language that
    complies with the OpenVMS calling standard. Interfacing with ELK
    offers the full advantage of a wide range of DEC VTX for OpenVMS
    VAX functions. ELK requires a thorough understanding of software
    development techniques used by the applications programmer.

 o  DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX Application Service (VAS)

    The DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX Application Service (VAS) is a higher
    level facility that uses the ELK interface. The VAS component is
    an OpenVMS run-time image used to present form, menu, and display
    pages from the host DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX server's infobase as
    the user interface to one or more transactional applications de-
    fined by the customer. The VAS component can also dynamically cre-
    ate menu pages that are formatted by the DEC VTX client. These trans-
    actional videotex applications can be defined entirely with VAS or
    distributed with VAS communicating to custom-written external ap-
    plications. Application interfaces include DECnet, P.S.I. X.25, and
    DECnet/SNA VMS APPC/LU6.2 Programming Interface.

 o  Remote Update Server Link (RUSL)

    The Remote Update Server Link (RUSL) is a shareable image of callable
    routines linked into custom-written code to create tailored update
    applications. RUSL applications can perform interactive DEC VTX for
    OpenVMS VAX page and keyword extractions, updates, additions, and
    deletions through the Update server. RUSL applications communicate
    with the Update server via DECnet.

 o  DEC VTX for OpenVMS VAX Documentation

    Documentation on the installation, as well as user's guides for the
    Service Provider, Information Provider, Application Provider, and
    Text Retrieval are included in the server kit.

 o  Packaging

    All DEC VTX clients, with the exception of the Microsoft Windows
    client (SPD 52.62.xx) and the Macintosh client (SPD 54.18.xx) are
    included with the server and can be copied to any node in the net-
    work.

                                  8

 

 Multilanguage support is included, allowing a user to select any one
 of the translated languages when starting the DEC VTX clients. DEC VTX
 for OpenVMS VAX server will be able to simultaneously serve clients
 in any of the translated languages.
