      This SPD describes OpenVMS Operating System Software for the Alpha and
      VAX computer family. Except where explicitly noted, the features de-
      scribed in this SPD apply equally to Alpha and VAX systems. OpenVMS
      Alpha and OpenVMS VAX operating system licenses and part numbers are
      architecture specific. Please refer to the Ordering Information 
      section of this SPD for further details.
   
      DESCRIPTION
   
      OpenVMS is a general-purpose multiuser operating system that runs in
      both production and development environments. OpenVMS Alpha supports
      Digital Equipment Corporation's Alpha series computers, while OpenVMS
      VAX supports VAX, MicroVAX, VAXstation, and VAXserver series comput-
      ers. OpenVMS software supports industry standards, facilitating 
      application portability and interoperability. OpenVMS provides 
      symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) support for multiprocessing Alpha 
      and VAX systems.
   
      The OpenVMS operating system can be tuned to perform well in a wide
      variety of environments. This includes combinations of compute-
      intensive, I/O-intensive, client/server, real-time, and other 
      environments. Actual system performance depends on the type of 
      computer, available physical memory, and the number and 
      type of active disk and tape drives.
   
      The OpenVMS operating system has well-integrated networking, 
      distributed computing, client/server, multiprocessing, and 
      windowing capabilities. It contains extensive features that promote 
      ease-of-use, improve the productivity of programmers, and 
      facilitate system management.
   
      OpenVMS is an open software environment that supports key standards
      such as OSF/Motif, POSIX, XPG4, and the OSF Distributed Computing En-
      vironment (DCE). The right to use POSIX for OpenVMS and the DCE 
      Runtime Services for OpenVMS is bundled with the OpenVMS operating 
      system base license. DECwindows Motif is available exclusively as a 
      separate layered product.
   
                                                            December 1995
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      OpenVMS Alpha Version 7.0 and OpenVMS VAX Version 7.0 are functional
      releases of the OpenVMS operating system for Digital's Alpha and VAX
      systems respectively. OpenVMS Alpha Version 7.0 provides the new func-
      tions listed below that are specifically designed to take advantage
      of the Alpha architecture's industry-leading performance capabilities:
   
      o  64-bit virtual addressing that allows the address space to be ex-
         panded beyond the past maximum capacity of 4 GB. The new maximum
         capacity for address space is currently 8 TB. Future hardware im-
         plementations will provide greater capacity. The OpenVMS Version
         7.0 operating system is already prepared to handle the additional
         space. OpenVMS Alpha compilers and applications take advantage of
         64-bit processing by using 64-bit data types. Refer to the SPDs for
         the OpenVMS Alpha compilers for further details. Note that 
         application-virtual address space defaults to a 32-bit 
         implementation for compatibility and migration purposes.
   
      o  Kernel threads extends process scheduling to allow a process to run
         concurrently on multiple CPUs in a multiprocessor system. Use of
         the new kernel threads capabilities provide many performance im-
         provements for applications. DECthreads is the interface for the
         kernel threads.
   
      o  Fast I/O provides a suite of new system services that are designed
         to give high CPU performance and improved SMP scaling of I/Os.
   
      o  Fast Path restructures the I/O mainline code path to improve both
         uniprocessor and multiprocessor I/O performance. Using Fast Path
         to create a path to a disk reduces the CPU use per I/O task. On 
         multiprocessor systems, all I/O activity for a process can be tied
         to a specific CPU, avoiding any primary CPU bottleneck issues. With
         multiple CPUs and ports, parallelism of I/O is greatly increased.
         User application changes are not required to take advantage of the
         Fast Path feature.
   
      o  Hypersort is a portable library of user-callable routines that pro-
         vide a high-performance sorting capability for Alpha systems.
   
      o  Global sections maximum size has been expanded from the previous
         3,276 KB to 65,535 KB.
   
                                       2
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      With OpenVMS Version 7.0, the following new functions are available
      on both Alpha and VAX systems:
   
      o  A POSIX 1003.1C-1995 style interface to DECthreads.
   
      o  Thread-independent services (TIS) that allow thread-safe APIs to
         be written.
   
      o  A cluster-wide $CREPRC parameter that allows users to create pro-
         cesses on remote nodes within a VMScluster.
   
      o  Enhanced Mail utility integration with TCP/IP that provides sup-
         port for signature files with MAILSHR and standard screen functions
         (scrolling) for reading messages and reviewing directory listings.
         Also provided are improvements that resolve quoting problems when
         attempting to reply to a mail message and provide the capability
         for parsing node names.
   
      o  Added network identification support that provides users with a 
         display (by using the SHOW NETWORK command from DCL) of all the 
         networks that are currently running.
   
      o  An extended Monitor utility for TCP/IP-only environments that uses
         the TCP/IP protocol to collect cluster-wide information. In the
         past, DECnet was the only protocol available to the 
         Monitor utility.
   
      o  The maximum number of process identifiers for queuing requests was
         raised to 1024.
   
      Refer to the OpenVMS Version 7.0 New Features Manual for further
      details on the above enhancements, features, and functions.
   
      System Support
   
      New systems will continue to be supported under the OpenVMS Version
      6.2 code base, as follows:

      ___________________________________________________________________
   
      The support for all three releases is cumulative. This means that all
      the support in OpenVMS Version 6.2-1H1 will be included in OpenVMS 
      Version 6.2-1H2; all the support in OpenVMS Version 6.2-1H2 will be 
      included in OpenVMS Version 6.2-1H3; and finally all of the 
      Version 6.2-1H3 support will be included in OpenVMS Version 7.1.
   
      Note: The new systems supported under the above releases will not be
      supported under OpenVMS Version 7.0.
   
      User Environment
   
      Users can access the OpenVMS software by using the English-like 
      DIGITAL Command Language (DCL), the command language for OpenVMS that
      is supplied with the system. DCL commands provide information about 
      the system and initiate system utilities and user programs. DCL 
      commands take the form of a command name followed by parameters and 
      qualifiers. OpenVMS prompts users to enter required DCL parameters, 
      making it easy for novice users.
   
      Users can enter DCL commands at a terminal or include them in command
      procedures. These command procedures can be run interactively or sub-
      mitted to a batch queue for later processing.
   
   
   
   
                                       4
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      Information on DCL and OpenVMS utilities is available online through
      the OpenVMS Help system. Online help includes summary information on
      all aspects of system operation.
   
      The following tools and utilities are integrated into the OpenVMS 
      operating system.
   
      Text Processing
   
      The Extensible Versatile Editor (EVE), one of several text editors 
      supplied by Digital, is the default editor for OpenVMS. EVE allows 
      users to insert, change, and delete text quickly. Written in the 
      Digital Text Processing Utility (DECTPU) language, EVE is a full-
      screen editor that allows users to scroll through text on a 
      terminal screen. EVE provides an EDT-style keypad, allowing EDT 
      users to move easily to EVE. EDT is also supported on OpenVMS Alpha 
      Version 7.0 and OpenVMS VAX Version 7.0.
   
      Mail Utility
   
      The Mail utility allows users to send messages to any other user on
      the system. Multinode operation is available if DECnet or DECnet/OSI
      is installed and licensed on each participating node on the network.
   
      Command-Level Programming
   
      Command-level programming allows users to create special files, called
      command procedures, that contain a series of DCL commands. When users
      execute a command procedure, the system processes the commands in the
      command procedure consecutively. Users can also use special DCL com-
      mands to:
   
      o  Assign symbolic names
   
      o  Evaluate numerical and logical expressions
   
      o  Accept parameters
   
      o  Communicate interactively with the user invoking the command pro-
         cedure
   
                                       5
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      o  Perform conditional (IF-THEN-ELSE) and branching (GOTO) logic
   
      o  Handle error conditions
   
      User Environment Tailoring
   
      Users can customize the computing environment with login command pro-
      cedures, shorthand commands, binding of commands to function keys, and
      command recall and editing.
   
      Terminal Fallback Facility (TFF)
   
      This facility allows Digital 7-bit terminals to input and output the
      Digital Multinational character set (MCS). Specific tables allow con-
      version for a number of different 7-bit National Replacement Charac-
      ter sets to MCS, such as French, German, Spanish, and Swedish. TFF 
      also allows character composition on terminals that do not have the 
      compose key.
   
      National Character Set (NCS) Utility
   
      This utility allows users to define non-ASCII string collating 
      sequences and to define conversion functions. Conversion functions 
      use conversion algorithms to change an input string; for example, 
      to change lowercase characters to uppercase. NCS also allows 
      OpenVMS Record Management Services (RMS) indexed files to be collated
      using user-specified collating sequences.
   
      Program Development Environment
   
      OpenVMS includes a comprehensive set of tools for developing programs,
      including: run-time libraries (RTLs), a linker, a librarian, and a 
      symbolic debugger. The assembly-level VAX MACRO-32 language is 
      supplied with OpenVMS VAX. The following tools are available to the 
      OpenVMS programmer.
   
      Language and Run-Time Library Support
   
   
   
                                       6
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      OpenVMS includes several RTLs that provide:
   
      o  String manipulation
   
      o  Parallel processing support
   
      o  I/O routines
   
      o  I/O conversion
   
      o  Terminal-independent screen handling
   
      o  Date and time formatting routines
   
      o  Highly-accurate mathematical functions
   
      o  Signaling and condition handling
   
      o  Other general-purpose functions
   
      With OpenVMS VAX, these routines can be called from programs written
      in such languages as VAX MACRO-32, VAX Ada, VAX BASIC, VAX BLISS-32
      Implementation Language, VAX C, DEC C, DEC C++, VAX COBOL, VAX DIBOL,
      DEC Fortran, VAX Pascal, and VAX PL/I.
   
      With OpenVMS Alpha, these routines can be called from programs writ-
      ten in such languages as MACRO-64, DEC Ada, DEC BASIC, DEC C, DEC C++,
      DEC COBOL, DEC Fortran, DEC Pascal, and DEC PL/1.
   
      Also included in OpenVMS Alpha are language-support libraries. While
      each language is different, all provide support for sequential file
      I/O and most support direct and indexed file I/O. Language RTLs also
      provide support for I/O formatting, error handling, and in DEC For-
      tran, the ability to read unformatted files that contain data from 
      other vendors.
   
      RTLs are provided to support translated images created from user-mode
      images built on OpenVMS VAX Version 4.0 through Version 5.5-2. Depend-
      ing on the method used to create the VAX image, these RTLs can be use-
      ful for images built on later versions of OpenVMS VAX that do not use
      features which were developed since OpenVMS VAX Version 5.5-2.
   
                                       7
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      Translated image RTLs are used to support a few architectural features
      that differ between VAX and Alpha systems, such as VAX D-float and H-
      float. They also support programs converted to run on Alpha systems
      before native Alpha compilers were available for particular program-
      ming languages.
   
      Many Digital languages adhere to the common calling standard. This
      means that routines written in any of these languages can directly 
      call routines written in any other language. Development of appli-
      cations using multiple languages is simple and straightforward.
   
      All user accessible routines in the RTLs follow the OpenVMS Alpha or
      OpenVMS VAX calling standard and condition-handling conventions, and
      most are contained within shareable images.
   
      At a lower level, programs can call system services directly for se-
      curity, event flag, asynchronous system trap, logical name, record and
      file I/O, process control, timer, time conversion, condition handling,
      lock management, and memory management. Again, system services use the
      OpenVMS VAX or OpenVMS Alpha calling standard and condition-handling
      conventions.
   
      OpenVMS supports the execution of user-mode images created on earlier
      versions of OpenVMS. Typically, recompiling and relinking are not re-
      quired.
   
      MACRO Compiler (Alpha only)
   
      For migration purposes, the MACRO compiler is supplied with the 
      OpenVMS Alpha software.
   
      DECthreads
   
      OpenVMS includes a user-mode multithreading capability, referred to
      as DECthreads. DECthreads provides a POSIX 1003.1C-1995 standard style
      interface and is Digital's implementation of the Distributed Comput-
      ing Environment (DCE) Threads as defined by the Open Software 
      Foundation (OSF).
   
   
   
                                       8
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      DECthreads is a library of run-time routines that allows the user to
      create multiple threads of execution within a single address space.
      Multithreading allows computation activity to overlap I/O activity.
      Synchronization elements, such as mutexes and condition variables, are
      provided to help ensure that shared resources are accessed correctly.
      For scheduling and prioritizing threads, DECthreads provides multi-
      ple scheduling policies. For debugging multithreaded applications,
      DECthreads is supported by the OpenVMS debugger. DECthreads also 
      provides Thread-Independent services (TIS) which assist in the 
      development of thread-safe APIs.
   
      Librarian Utility
   
      The Librarian utility permits storage of object modules, image files,
      macros, help text, or any general record-oriented information in cen-
      tral, easily accessible files. Object module and image file libraries
      are searched by the linker when the linker finds a reference it can-
      not resolve in one of its input files. Alpha macro libraries are 
      searched by the MACRO-32 compiler and MACRO-64 assembler when either 
      finds a macro name that is not defined in the input file. VAX macro 
      libraries are searched by the assembler when the assembler finds a 
      macro that is not defined in the input file.
   
      Debugger
   
      The OpenVMS Debugger allows users to trace program execution, as well
      as display and modify register contents using the same symbols that
      are present in the source code.
   
      Alpha System-Code Debugger
   
      The OpenVMS Alpha System-Code Debugger is a kernel code debugger. It
      allows a system code developer to trace the execution of nonpageable
      system code at any Interrupt Priority Level (IPL). Based on the 
      OpenVMS Alpha Debugger, the system-code debugger uses the same 
      interface and a majority of the same command set.
   
      System Dump Analyzer (SDA) Utility
   
   
   
                                       9
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      In the event of a system failure, OpenVMS writes the contents of mem-
      ory to a pre-allocated dump file. This dump file can later be analyzed
      using SDA. System dumps can either be full memory dumps, where all 
      memory is written, or selective memory dumps, where only memory in use
      at the time of the system failure is written. Full memory dumps re-
      quire a dump file big enough to hold all memory. Selective memory 
      dumps write as much of the memory in use at the time of the system 
      failure that will fit into the dump file. Therefore, this file is 
      often much smaller in size. Dump compression enables these dump 
      files to reside on the system disk.
   
      OpenVMS for Alpha supports selective dumps on systems configured with
      any supported amount of memory. Full dumps are only supported on sys-
      tems configured with up to 4 GB of memory.
   
      RMS File Utilities
   
      RMS file utilities allow users to analyze the internal structure of
      an RMS file and to determine the most appropriate set of parameters
      for the file. The RMS file utilities can also be used to create, load,
      and reclaim space in an RMS file. Refer to the Operating System 
      Environment section of this SPD for more information on RMS.
   
      File Differences Utility
   
      This utility compares the contents of two files and lists those 
      records that do not match.
   
      Translated Image Environment (TIE) (Alpha only)
   
      OpenVMS Alpha provides an array of services that allow the operation
      of programs which have undergone binary translation from OpenVMS VAX
      images. These programs perform virtually all user-mode functions on
      OpenVMS Alpha and operate in combination with other programs (images)
      that have been translated from OpenVMS VAX or have been built using
      native compilers on OpenVMS Alpha. Without requiring special source
      code, the TIE resolves differences between the VAX and Alpha archi-
      tectures, including floating-point registers, condition codes, excep-
      tion handling, and ASTs.
   
   
                                       10
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      The TIE included with OpenVMS Alpha can run images that have been 
      translated elsewhere. The DECmigrate for OpenVMS AXP layered 
      product can be used to translate user-mode images from OpenVMS VAX. 
      For additional information on the characteristics of programs 
      suitable for binary translation, refer to the DECmigrate for 
      OpenVMS AXP Systems Software Product Description (SPD 39.44.xx).
   
   
      System Management Environment
   
      OpenVMS provides a variety of features that aid the system manager in
      configuring and maintaining an optimal system. The following features
      are available to system managers.
   
      OpenVMS Management Station Version 1.0
   
      The new OpenVMS Management Station enables user account management on
      one or more VMScluster systems from a single Microsoft Windows-based
      PC. It provides the ability to perform management tasks across mul-
      tiple systems, making it possible to easily modify many accounts in
      a single operation. The Management Station provides a comprehensive
      interface to the user account management features of AUTHORIZE, 
      DISKQUOTA, and some DCL directory maintenance commands. This enables 
      system managers to add a user authorization file (UAF) entry, grant 
      rights identifiers, and create directories, disk quotas, and mail 
      profiles. In addition, the Management Station allows system managers 
      to create network proxy records and support storing personal informa-
      tion such as phone number, location, and site-specific identification.
   
      The Management Station supports such account management operations as
      account creation, modification, and deletion, as well as renaming 
      accounts and displaying account attributes.
   
      The following are Version 1.0 restrictions to managing OpenVMS 
      systems:
   
      o  Managing OpenVMS cluster members as individual nodes is not sup-
         ported. OpenVMS cluster systems are treated as indivisible enti-
         ties; an operation cannot be performed on specific cluster members.
   
      o  OpenVMS clusters with multiple UAFs are not supported.
   
                                       11
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      o  PCs currently support DECnet Phase IV only. However, due to the 
         built-in backward compatibility between DECnet/OSI and DECnet 
         Phase IV, this does not impose any restrictions on operations 
         between a PC client and the server, as long as the node addresses 
         are within the Phase IV address space (maximum 63 areas with 
         maximum 1,023 nodes per area).
   
      The Management Station is a client/server application based on PATH-
      WORKS ManageWORKS. The PC client requires Microsoft Windows Version
      3.1 (or Microsoft Windows for Workgroups Version 3.11) and PATHWORKS
      V5.0A or V5.1 for DOS and Windows client which, includes ManageWORKS.
      The PATHWORKS server is not required. The Management Station server
      component must be installed on OpenVMS VAX Version 6.1 or higher or
      OpenVMS Alpha Version 6.2 or higher. The Management Station software
      is included under the OpenVMS base license.
   
      InfoServer Tape Backup
   
      With Version 6.1 of the OpenVMS operating system, system managers can
      now back up and restore the system disk to tapes connected to an 
      InfoServer system.
   
      Batch and Print Queuing System
   
      OpenVMS provides an extensive batch and print capability that allows
      the creation of queues and the setup of spooled devices in order to
      process noninteractive workloads in parallel with timesharing or real-
      time jobs.
   
      The OpenVMS batch and print operations support two types of queues:
      generic queues and execution queues. A generic queue is an interme-
      diate queue that holds a job until an appropriate execution queue be-
      comes available to initiate the job. An execution queue is a queue 
      through which the job (either print or batch) is actually processed.
   
      The system queues batch jobs for execution. The system manager can 
      regulate the number of queues and the number of streams per queue 
      which is the number of batch jobs in the queue that can execute 
      concurrently.
   
   
   
                                       12
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      Both generic and execution batch queues can have different attributes,
      such as the maximum CPU time permitted, working set size, and prior-
      ity. Facilities are provided for starting and stopping queues and for
      starting and stopping jobs in a queue. Because multiple execution 
      queues can be associated with a generic queue, OpenVMS VAX enables 
      load balancing across available CPUs in a VMScluster system, 
      increasing overall system throughput.
   
      Print queues, both generic and execution, together with queue manage-
      ment facilities, provide versatile print capabilities, including sup-
      port of ANSI and PostScript file printing.
   
      Accounting Utility
   
      For accounting purposes, OpenVMS keeps records of system resource us-
      age. These statistics include processor and memory utilization, I/O
      counts, print symbiont line counts, image activation counts, and pro-
      cess termination records. The OpenVMS Accounting utility enables 
      various reports to be generated using this data.
   
      Audit Analysis Utility
   
      For security auditing purposes, OpenVMS selectively records critical
      security-relevant events in the system security audit log file. These
      records contain the date and time the event occurred, the identity of
      the associated user process, and information specific to each event
      type. This information is intended to aid the system manager in main-
      taining system security and to deter possible intruders. The OpenVMS
      Audit Analysis utility enables various reports to be generated from
      this data.
   
      Autoconfigure/AUTOGEN Utilities
   
      The Autoconfigure and AUTOGEN utilities automatically configure the
      available devices in the system tables and set system parameters based
      on the peripheral and memory architecture. This eliminates the need
      for a traditional system generation process when the hardware config-
      uration is expanded or otherwise modified.
   
   
   
                                       13
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      The OpenVMS AUTOGEN command procedure sets a number of system param-
      eters automatically by detecting the devices installed in a config-
      uration. A feedback option can be used to generate a report of 
      recommended parameter settings based on previous usage patterns.
   
      Backup Utility
   
      The Backup utility provides full-volume and incremental file backups
      for file-structured, mounted volumes and volume sets. Individual 
      files, selected directory structures, or all files on a volume set 
      can be backed up and restored. Files can be selected by various dates
      (such as creation or modification) and can be backed up to magnetic 
      tape, magnetic disk, or Write Once Read Many (WORM) optical disk. The
      Backup utility can also be used to restore a save set or list the 
      contents of a save set.
   
      The Backup Manager for OpenVMS provides a screen-oriented interface
      to the Backup utility which assists users in performing routine backup
      operations. The Backup Manager is menu-driven and provides:
   
      o  Access to the save, restore, and list operations without having to
         understand Backup command syntax
   
      o  The ability to create, modify, recall and delete Backup Manager 
         templates that describe the Backup save operations
   
      The Backup Manager works on all supported OpenVMS configurations with
      a video terminal. It uses the Screen Management (SMG) RTL routines to
      provide a window-like user interface. The software does not assume
      any particular privilege on the part of its user beyond access to the
      files and devices being operated upon.
   
      Standalone BACKUP Utility (VAX only)
   
      Standalone BACKUP provides a mechanism for system managers to back up
      and restore system disks. This utility can also be used during the 
      installation of the OpenVMS VAX operating system.
   
      Analyze Disk Structure Utility
   
   
                                       14
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      The Analyze Disk Structure utility compares the structure information
      on a disk volume with the contents of the disk, prints the structure
      information, and permits changes to that information. It also can be
      used to repair errors that are detected in the file structure of 
      disks.
   
      Monitor Utility
   
      The Monitor utility enables the system manager to monitor different
      classes of systemwide performance data including: process activity,
      I/O activity, memory management activity, vector processing activity
      (VAX only), and two-phase commit transaction activity at specified in-
      tervals. The data may be displayed as it is gathered or saved in a 
      file for later use.
   
      License Management Facility (LMF)
   
      The License Management facility allows the system manager to enable
      software licenses and to determine which software products are 
      licensed on an OpenVMS system.
   
      System Management Utility (SYSMAN)
   
      The System Management utility allows system managers to define a man-
      agement environment in which operations performed from the local 
      OpenVMS system can be executed on all other OpenVMS systems in the 
      environment. The environment can include OpenVMS Alpha and VAX 
      systems configured in a VMScluster or multiple systems networked 
      through DECnet or DECnet/OSI.
   
      Operations
   
      OpenVMS allows for varying levels of privilege to be assigned to dif-
      ferent operators. Operators can use the OpenVMS Help Message utility
      to receive online descriptions of error messages. In addition, system-
      generated messages can be routed to different terminals based on their
      interest to the console operators, tape librarians, security admin-
      istrators, and system managers.

      Security
   
      For OpenVMS Version 7.0, security APIs for intrusion detection, proxy
      access, and impersonation services have been added on both the Alpha
      and VAX platform to provide better security in client/server appli-
      cations.
   
      As the following table illustrates, OpenVMS is committed to consis-
      tently delivering rated security in our base products.

      Digital also plans to continue to maintain C2 and B1 ratings on 
      future versions of the OpenVMS and SEVMS operating systems.
   
      The ratings represent NCSC validation of the design of OpenVMS and 
      SEVMS operating systems against DoD 5200.28-STD Department of Defense
      Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria. To obtain an in-depth, 
      230-page report on the security of these systems, contact the NCSC at
      (410)859-4452 and ask for a copy of the Final Evaluation Report 
      Digital Equipment Corporation OpenVMS VAX and SEVMS VAX Version 6.0, 
      CSC-EPL-93/002, C-Evaluation No.14-94.
   
      OpenVMS provides a rich set of tools to control user access to system-
      controlled data structures and devices that store information. Open-
      VMS employs a reference monitor concept that mediates all access at-
      tempts between subjects (such as user processes) and security-relevant
   
                                       16
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      system objects (such as files). OpenVMS also provides a system 
      security audit log file that records the results of all object access 
      attempts. The audit log can also be used to capture information 
      regarding a wide variety of other security-relevant events.
   
      User account information is maintained by the system manager in the
      system user authorization file (SYSUAF). When creating user accounts
      with the Authorize utility, the system manager assigns the privileges
      and quotas associated with each user account. The system manager also
      assigns a user name, password, and unique user identification code 
      (UIC) to each account. Additional identifiers can be assigned to each
      account, allowing users to belong to multiple overlapping groups or 
      projects. Account use may be limited by the time of day, day of week,
      and type of access, such as local, remote, network, or batch.
   
      To log in and gain access to the system, the user must supply a valid
      user name and password. The password is encoded and does not appear
      on terminal displays. Users can change their password voluntarily, or
      the system manager can specify how frequently passwords change, along
      with minimum password length, and the use of randomly-generated 
      passwords.
   
      In addition, OpenVMS provides a password dictionary filter that 
      screens password choices for common words, and a user password 
      history filter that prevents users from reusing passwords that they 
      have used within the past year. In addition to these built-in fil-
      ters, a site can design and install its own filter to screen 
      passwords according to a site-specific password policy.
   
      The system password hash algorithm can also be replaced with a pri-
      vate algorithm for those sites that have contractual obligations to
      use specific public or private password encryption algorithms. This
      feature can be enabled on a per-user, per-password basis.
   
      Login security includes break-in detection, which disables terminals
      when password guessing is detected. Also, users retain a secure lo-
      gin path, which can thwart Trojan horse attacks against local termi-
      nals. Additionally, a system password can be associated with dial-in
      terminal lines to prevent the display of any operating system-specific
   
   
                                       17
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      identification that might yield clues to possible attack methods. When
      a user logs in, the system also displays a message stating when the
      last login for the account occurred and the number of failed attempts
      since the last successful login.
   
      Every security-relevant system object is labeled with the UIC of its
      owner along with a simple protection mask. The owner UIC consists of
      two fields, the user field and a group field. System objects also have
      a protection mask that allows read, write, execute, and delete access
      to the object's owner, group, privileged system users, and to all 
      other users. System objects can be protected with access control 
      lists (ACLs) that allow access to be granted or denied to a list of 
      individual users, groups, or identifiers. ACLs can also be used to 
      audit access attempts to critical system objects.
   
      OpenVMS applies full protection to the following system objects:
   
      o  Capabilities (VAX only)
   
      o  Common event flag clusters
   
      o  Devices
   
      o  Files
   
      o  Group global sections
   
      o  Logical name tables
   
      o  Batch/print queues
   
      o  Resource domains
   
      o  Security classes
   
      o  System global sections
   
      o  Volumes (ODS-2)
   
      o  Spiralog volumes
   
                                       18
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      OpenVMS provides security attribute defaults in the form of security
      profile templates. These templates are referenced whenever a new ob-
      ject is created and provide a means of associating default security
      information with each system object class, except for files. Protec-
      tion information for files is inherited from the previous version of
      an existing file, the parent directory, or the default protection of
      the creating process.
   
      Data scavenging protection can be enabled in the form of high-water
      marking and erase on delete attributes. These attributes ensure that
      the contents of a file cannot be read after the file has been deleted.
      The system manager can also enforce file erasure on a per-volume 
      basis. The disk erasure pattern can also be replaced with a private 
      pattern for those sites that have contractual obligations to use a 
      specific pattern.
   
      Security auditing is provided for the selective recording of security-
      related events. This auditing information can be directed to security
      operator terminals (alarms) or to the system security audit log file
      (audits). Each audit record contains the date and time of the event,
      the identity of the associated user process, and additional informa-
      tion specific to each event.
   
      OpenVMS provides security auditing for the following events:
   
      o  Login and logout
   
      o  Login failures and break-in attempts
   
      o  Object creation, access, deaccess, and deletion, selectable by use
         of privilege, type of access, and on individual objects
   
      o  Authorization database changes
   
      o  Network logical link connections and terminations for DECnet for
         OpenVMS VAX, DECnet/OSI, DECwindows, IPC, and SYSMAN (VAX only)
   
      o  Use of identifiers as privileges
   
      o  Installed image additions, deletions, and replacements
   
      o  Volume mounts and dismounts
   
                                       19
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      o  Use of the Network Control Program (NCP) utility (VAX only)
   
      o  Use or failed use of individual privileges
   
      o  Use of individual process control system services
   
      o  System parameter changes
   
      o  System time changes and recalibrations
   
      Note: Since no system can provide complete security, Digital cannot 
      guarantee complete system security. However, Digital continually 
      strives to enhance the security capabilities of its products. Cus- 
      tomers are advised to follow industry-recognized security practices.
   
      Operating System Environment
   
      OpenVMS VAX Processes and Scheduling
   
      The basic unit of execution in OpenVMS is the process. A process con-
      sists of individual address space and registers known as context, and
      code called an executable image. The context identifies the process
      and describes its current state. Executable images consist of system
      programs and user programs that have been compiled and linked.
   
      The maximum number of concurrent processes is 8,192 per OpenVMS VAX
      system.
   
      Processes receive time to execute their images based on the priority.
      Thirty-two priorities are recognized on OpenVMS VAX, and sixty-four
      priorities are recognized on OpenVMS Alpha. Priorities 0 to 15 are for
      time-sharing processes and applications that are not time critical 
      (four is the typical default for timesharing processes). Priorities 
      16 to 32 on VAX and 16 to 63 on Alpha are for real-time processes.
   
      Each time an event such as an I/O interrupt occurs, the system ser-
      vices the event first and then passes control to the highest prior-
      ity process ready to execute. The system automatically adjusts the 
      priorities of processes in the range of 0 to 15 to favor I/O-bound and
   
   
                                       20
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      interactive processes. However, the system does not adjust the pri-
      ority of a process in the range of 16 to 31 for VAX or 16 to 63 for
      Alpha.
   
      Real-time processes can be assigned higher priorities to ensure that
      they receive processor time whenever they are ready to execute. Real-
      time processes are scheduled preemptively; that is, if a real-time 
      process is ready to execute, it is given to the processor immediately,
      unless a process with a higher priority is ready to execute.
   
      OpenVMS uses paging and swapping to provide sufficient virtual mem-
      ory for concurrently executing processes. Also, paging and swapping
      are provided for processes whose memory requirements exceed available
      physical memory. The maximum working set size is 512 MB of memory for
      VAX and 4 GB for Alpha.
   
      Programmers can control memory management from within an image. An 
      image executing in a real-time process, for example, can inhibit 
      paging or swapping of critical code and data.
   
      Peripheral devices can be managed by the system or allocated by in-
      dividual processes. At least one disk must be a system disk. Other 
      disks can be designated as data disks for the general use of all 
      users logging in to the system or for a specific group of users. 
      The system controls interactive terminals and one or more printers.
   
      OpenVMS Alpha Processes and Scheduling
   
      The basic unit of execution in OpenVMS Alpha is the kernel thread. A
      kernel thread consists of individual address space and registers known
      as context, and code called an executable image. The context identi-
      fies the kernel thread and describes its current state. Each process
      can have up to 16 kernel threads. Executable images consist of sys-
      tem programs and user programs that have been compiled and linked.
   
      The maximum number of concurrent processes is 16,384 per OpenVMS 
      Alpha system.
   
   
   
   
                                       21
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      Kernel threads receive processor time to execute their images based
      on the priority of the process. Thirty-two priorities are recognized
      on OpenVMS VAX and sixty-four priorities are recognized on OpenVMS 
      Alpha. Priorities 0 to 15 are for time-sharing processes and applica-
      tions that are not time critical (four is the typical default for 
      timesharing processes). Priorities 16 to 32 on VAX and 16 to 63 on 
      Alpha are for real-time processes.
   
      Each time an event such as an I/O interrupt occurs, the system first
      services the event and then passes control to the highest priority
      kernel thread ready to execute. The system adjusts the priorities of 
      kernel threads whose base priority is in the range of 0 to 15 to favor
      I/O-bound and interactive processes. However, the system does not ad-
      just the priority of a kernel thread in the range of 16 to 31 for VAX
      or 16 to 63 for Alpha.
   
      Real-time processes can be assigned higher priorities to ensure that
      they receive processor time whenever they are ready to execute. Real-
      time processes are scheduled preemptively; that is, if a real-time 
      process is ready to execute, it is given to the processor immediately,
      unless a a higher priority process is ready to execute.
   
      OpenVMS uses paging and swapping to provide sufficient virtual mem-
      ory for concurrently executing processes. Also, paging and swapping
      is provided for processes whose memory requirements exceed available
      physical memory.
   
      Programmers can control memory management from within an image. An 
      image executing in a real-time process, for example, can inhibit 
      paging or swapping of critical code and data.
   
      Peripheral devices can be managed by the system or allocated by in-
      dividual processes. At least one disk must be a system disk. Other 
      disks can be designated as data disks for the general use of all 
      users logging in to the system or for a specific group of users. 
      The system controls interactive terminals and one or more printers.
   
      Extended Physical Addressing (VAX only)

      With OpenVMS VAX Version 6.0, physical address space was extended from
      30 bits to 32 bits. The OpenVMS VAX operating system can provide 3.5
      GB of physical memory and .5 GB of I/O and adapter space. This enables
      large applications and workloads to access the large amounts of phys-
      ical memory that they require. The following table lists the VAX pro-
      cessors that support this extended physical addressing.

      Vector Processing (VAX only)
   
      A single data item with only one value is known as a scalar value. A
      group of related scalar values, or elements, with the same data type,
      is known as a vector.
   
      An extension to the VAX architecture defines an optional design for
      integrated vector processing that has been adopted by several VAX sys-
      tems. The VAX vector architecture includes sixteen 64-bit vector reg-
      isters (V0 through V15), each containing 64 elements; vector control
      registers; vector function units; and a set of vector instructions.
      VAX vector instructions transfer data between the vector registers and
      memory; perform integer and floating-point arithmetic; and execute 
      processor control functions.
   
      A more detailed description of the VAX vector architecture, vector 
      registers, and vector instructions appears in the VAX MACRO and 
      Instruction Set Reference Manual.

      The OpenVMS VAX operating system provides fully shared, multiprogram-
      ming support for VAX vector processing systems. By default, OpenVMS 
      VAX loads vector support code when initializing vector-present 
      systems but does not load it when initializing vector-absent systems.
      System managers can control this behavior using the VECTOR_PROC 
      system parameter.
   
      The presence of vector support code in a system has little effect on
      processes running in a scalar-only system, or scalar processes run-
      ning in a vector-present system. If many processes must compete si-
      multaneously for vector processor resources, the system manager can
      maintain good performance by adjusting system resources and process
      quotas.
   
      The OpenVMS VAX operating system makes the services of the vector pro-
      cessor available to system users by means of a software abstract known
      as a capability. A system manager can restrict the use of the vector
      processor to users holding a particular identifier by associating an
      ACL entry with the VECTOR object.
   
      The VAX Vector Instruction Emulation facility (VVIEF) is a standard
      feature of the OpenVMS VAX operating system. It allows vectorized 
      applications to be written and debugged in a VAX system in which vec-
      tor processors are not available. VVIEF emulates the VAX vector pro-
      cessing environment, including the nonprivileged VAX vector instruc-
      tions and the OpenVMS VAX vector system services. Use of VVIEF is 
      restricted to code in user mode.
   
      DECdtm Services
   
      The DECdtm services embedded in the OpenVMS operating system support
      fully distributed databases using a two-phase commit protocol. The 
      DECdtm services provide the technology and features for distributed 
      processing, ensuring both transaction and database integrity across 
      multiple Digital resource managers. Updates to distributed databases 
      occur as a single all-or-nothing unit of work, regardless of where the
      data physically resides. This ensures the consistency of distributed
      data.
   
   
   
   
                                       24
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      DECdtm services allow applications to define global transactions that
      may include calls to any number of Digital data management products.
      Regardless of the mix of data management products used, the global 
      transaction either commits or stops. OpenVMS is unique in providing 
      transaction processing functionality with base operating system 
      services.
   
      DECdtm features include:
   
      o  Embedded OpenVMS system services that support the DECtp architec-
         ture, providing the features and technology for distributed 
         transaction processing.
   
      o  The ability for multiple disjoint resources to be updated atomi-
         cally. These resources can be either physically disjointed (for ex-
         ample, on different CPUs) or logically disjointed (for example, in
         different databases on the same CPU).
   
      o  Encourages robust application development. Applications can be 
         written to ensure that data is never in an inconsistent state, 
         even in the event of system failures.
   
      o  Can be called using any Digital TP monitor or database product. 
         This is useful for applications using several Digital database 
         products.
   
      Interprocess Communication
   
      OpenVMS provides the following facilities for applications that con-
      sist of multiple cooperating processes:
   
      o  Mailboxes as virtual devices that allow processes to communicate
         with queued messages.
   
      o  Shared memory sections on a single processor or an SMP system that
         permits multiple processes to access shared address space 
         concurrently.
   
      o  Common event flags that provide simple synchronization.
   
      o  A lock manager that provides a more comprehensive enqueue/dequeue
         facility with multilevel locks, values, and asynchronous system 
         traps (ASTs).
   
      Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP)
   
                                       25
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      OpenVMS provides symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) support for Alpha and
      VAX multiprocessor systems. SMP is a form of tightly coupled multi-
      processing in which all processors perform operations simultaneously.
      The processors can perform operations in all OpenVMS access modes, 
      such as user, supervisor, executive, and kernel.
   
      OpenVMS SMP configurations consist of multiple CPUs executing code 
      from a single shared memory address space. Users and processes share 
      a single copy of OpenVMS Alpha or OpenVMS VAX address space. SMP also
      provides simultaneous shared access to common data in global sections
      to all processors. OpenVMS SMP selects the CPU where a process will 
      run based on its priority.
   
      SMP support is an integral part of OpenVMS and is provided to the user
      transparently. Because an SMP system is a single system entity, it is
      configured into a network and VMScluster configurations as a single
      node.
   
      Networking Facilities
   
      OpenVMS provides device drivers for all Digital Local Area Network 
      (LAN) adapters listed in the LAN Options section of Appendix A of 
      this SPD. Application programmers can use the QIO system service to 
      communicate with other systems connected via the LAN using either 
      Ethernet or Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineer (IEEE) 
      802.3 packet format. Simultaneous use of Digital Ethernet and the 
      IEEE 802.3 protocols are supported on any Digital LAN adapter.
   
      DECnet/OSI offers task-to-task communications, file management, down-
      line system and task loading, network command terminals, and network
      resource sharing capabilities as defined in the Digital Network Ar-
      chitecture (DNA) Phase V protocols. DECnet/OSI provides the newest 
      DECnet features such as extended addressing and downline-load
      performance enhancements. DECnet/OSI integrates DECnet and OSI 
      protocols and now provides a linkage to TCP/IP using Request for 
      Comments (RFC) 1006 and RFC 1006+. DECnet and OSI applications can 
      now be run over DECnet (NSP), OSI (CLNS), and TCP/IP transports.

      DECnet for OpenVMS Alpha and DECnet for OpenVMS VAX offer the 
      networking capabilities as defined in the Digital Network 
      Architecture (DNA) Phase IV. For more information, see the 
      DECnet/OSI and DECnet Software portion of the Associated Products 
      section of this SPD.
   
      Terminal Server Products
   
      Digital's terminal server products can be used for terminal server ac-
      cess to OpenVMS. When used in a VMScluster environment, terminal 
      servers distribute users across the available Alpha and VAX systems 
      at login time.
   
      OpenVMS can also establish a connection to other devices (such as 
      printers) that are attached to such terminal servers.
   
      Reliability
   
      OpenVMS handles hardware errors as transparently as possible while 
      maintaining data integrity and providing sufficient information to 
      diagnose errors. The system limits the effects of an error by first 
      determining if the error is fatal. If the error occurs in system con-
      text, then the current OpenVMS system shuts down. If the error is not
      fatal, the system recovers actions pertinent to the error and 
      continues the current operation.
   
      In all cases, information relevant to the error is written to the 
      error log file for later analysis. Hardware errors include the 
      following categories:
   
      o  Processor errors. These include processor soft errors, processor
         hard errors, processor machine checks, and adapter errors.
   
      o  Memory errors. These can be unrecoverable (hard) errors or recov-
         erable (soft) errors. The system examines memory at startup time
         and does not use any bad pages. During system operation, the sys-
         tem corrects all single-bit memory errors for those systems with
         error correction code (ECC) memory. On OpenVMS VAX, an unrecover-
         able error causes the memory page on which the error occurred to
         be added to the bad page list. If the page has not been modified,
         system operation continues with a new copy of the page.
   
                                       27
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      o  Correctable memory errors. A primary cause of these correctable 
         memory errors is Alpha particle radiation. On some processors, when
         correctable memory errors occur, the memory controller corrects 
         only the data returned to the CPU or I/O controller. The actual 
         data in memory is left with the error intact. Subsequent read 
         operations cause correction cycles to occur and, in most cases, 
         an interrupt to report the error. On many of these processors, 
         OpenVMS monitors the occurrence of correctable memory errors and, 
         in most cases, is able to remove the error condition by rewriting 
         the data in memory. Rewriting the data causes the data to be 
         corrected in that location. On OpenVMS VAX, if the cause of the 
         error is not transient, and the error condition persists, the 
         operating system attempts to move the data from the page with the
         error to a new page. The original page is then retired from use.
   
      Other failures include:
   
      o  Operating system errors (system-detected inconsistencies or archi-
         tectural errors in system context)
   
      o  User errors
   
      o  I/O errors
   
      The system logs all processor errors, all operating system errors de-
      tected through internal consistency checks, all double-bit memory er-
      rors (and a summary of corrected single-bit memory errors), and most
      I/O errors.
   
      If the system is shut down because of an unrecoverable hardware or 
      software error, a dump of physical memory is written. The dump 
      includes the contents of the processor registers. The OpenVMS System 
      Dump Analyzer (SDA) utility is provided for analyzing memory dumps.
   
      Power Failures (VAX only)
   
      If the power fails, the system shuts down automatically. When power
      is restored, the system restarts automatically and resumes process-
      ing at the point of interruption under these circumstances:
   
   
                                       28
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      o  If the system has a time-of-day clock and a memory battery backup
         unit
   
      o  If the contents of memory is still valid
   
      o  If the system is set to permit automatic rebooting
   
      The system restarts devices and communications lines and all I/O op-
      erations in progress, including magnetic tape I/O operations. On re-
      quest, programs can be notified of power restoration. An optional 
      battery-operated hardware clock resets the date and time of day when 
      the system restarts. If the system does not have a battery backup 
      unit, or if the contents of memory is not valid on restoration, the 
      system reboots automatically if it is set to automatic rebooting.
   
      If, for any reason, after a power failure the system disk does not 
      come back on line within a specific time after the CPU regains power,
      the system shuts down.
   
      Input/Output
   
      The QIO system service provides a direct interface to the operating
      system's I/O routines. These services are available from within most
      OpenVMS programming languages using the $IO_PERFORM command and can
      be used to perform low-level I/O operations efficiently with a min-
      imal amount of system overhead for time-critical applications.
   
      Device drivers execute I/O instructions to transfer data to and from
      a device and to communicate directly with an I/O device. Each type of
      I/O device requires its own driver. Digital supplies drivers for all
      devices supported by the OpenVMS operating system and provides QIO 
      system service routines to access the special features available in 
      many of these devices.
   
      OpenVMS supports a variety of disk and tape peripheral devices, as 
      well as terminals, networks, and mailboxes (virtual devices for 
      interprocess communication), and more general I/O devices.
   
   
   
   
                                       29
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      With OpenVMS Alpha, users can write drivers for I/O devices without
      supplied drivers. OpenVMS Alpha Version 7.0 supports the Step 2 de-
      vice driver interface, which allows device drivers to be written in
      DEC C and MACRO-32. OpenVMS Alpha documentation is available that de-
      scribes how to write OpenVMS Alpha device drivers and how to convert
      existing Step 1 drivers to OpenVMS Alpha Step 2 device drivers. The
      DEC C compiler for OpenVMS Alpha is an optional layered product.
   
      With OpenVMS VAX, users can write their own drivers in MACRO-32 for
      I/O devices without drivers. The OpenVMS VAX Device Support Manual and
      the OpenVMS VAX Device Support Reference Manual in the OpenVMS Full
      Documentation Set describe how to write device drivers.
   
      Record Management Services (RMS)
   
      RMS is a set of I/O services that helps application programs to pro-
      cess and manage files and records. Although it is intended to provide
      a comprehensive software interface to mass storage devices, RMS also
      supports device-independent access to unit-record devices.
   
      RMS supports sequential, relative, and indexed file organizations in
      fixed-length and variable-length record formats. RMS also supports 
      byte stream formats for sequential file organization.
   
      RMS record access modes provide access to records in four ways:
   
      o  Sequentially
   
      o  Directly by key value
   
      o  Directly by relative record number
   
      o  Directly by record file address
   
      RMS also supports block I/O operations for various performance-
      critical applications that require user-defined file organizations 
      and record formats.
   
      RMS promotes safe and efficient file sharing by providing multiple 
      file access modes, automatic record locking (where applicable), and 
      optional buffer sharing by multiple processes.
   
                                       30
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      RMS utilities aid file creation and record maintenance. These util-
      ities convert files from one organization and format to another; re-
      structure indexed files for storage and access efficiency; and reclaim
      data structures within indexed files. These utilities also generate
      appropriate reports.
   
      For systems that have DECnet for OpenVMS VAX, DECnet for OpenVMS 
      Alpha, or DECnet/OSI installed, RMS provides a subset of file and 
      record management services to remote network nodes. Remote file 
      operations over the network are generally transparent to user 
      programs.
   
      Commands such as EDIT, CREATE, COPY, TYPE, and PRINT allow users to
      manipulate RMS records within RMS files at the DCL command level.
   
      Virtual I/O Cache
   
      OpenVMS provides a standalone or clusterwide, file-oriented disk 
      cache. Applications benefit from the advantages of the virtual I/O 
      cache without any special coding. The virtual I/O file-caching 
      algorithm is chosen based on the type of clusterwide access currently
      in progress. Virtual I/O caching reduces current and potential I/O 
      bottlenecks within OpenVMS systems. It reduces the number of I/Os to 
      the disk subsystem, thereby reducing systemwide bottlenecks.
   
      Disk and Tape Volumes
   
      Disk volumes can be organized into volume sets. Volume sets can con-
      tain a mix of disk device types and can be extended by adding volumes.
      Within a volume set, files of any organization type can span multi-
      ple volumes. Files can be allocated to the set as a whole (the 
      default) or to specific volumes within the set. Optionally, portions 
      of indexed files can be allocated to specific areas of a single disk 
      or to specific volumes in a volume set.
   
      Quotas can be placed on a disk to control the amount of space indi-
      vidual users can allocate. Quota assignment is made by UIC and can be
      controlled for each individual volume set in the system (or for each
      individual volume if the volume is not part of a set).
   
   
   
                                       31
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      Disk structure information can be cached in memory to reduce the I/O
      overhead required for file management services. Although not required
      to do so, users can preallocate space and control automatic alloca-
      tion. For example, a file can be extended by a given number of blocks,
      contiguously or noncontiguously, for optimal file system performance.
   
      The system applies software validity checks and checksums to criti-
      cal disk structure information. If a disk is improperly dismounted be-
      cause of user error or system failure, the system rebuilds the disk's
      structure information automatically the next time the disk is mounted.
      The system detects bad blocks and prevents their reuse once the files
      to which the blocks were allocated are deleted. On DIGITAL Storage
      Architecture (DSA) disks, the disk controller detects and replaces bad
      blocks automatically.
   
      The system provides eight levels of named directories and subdirec-
      tories whose contents are alphabetically ordered. Device and file 
      specifications follow Digital conventions. Logical names can be used 
      to abbreviate the specifications and to make application programs 
      device and file name independent. A logical name can be assigned to 
      an entire specification, to a portion of a specification, or to 
      another logical name.
   
      OpenVMS supports multivolume magnetic tape files with transparent vol-
      ume switching. Access positioning is done either by file name or by
      relative file position.
   
      Monitoring Performance History (MPH) Software
   
      MPH software is distributed with the OpenVMS distribution kit and is
      installed separately. MPH is a tool which collects error logs, crash
      dump summaries, and configuration data from the system on which it is
      installed. This data, such as Mean Time between Crash (MTBCr) and Mean
      Time Between System Interruption (MTBSi), is transmitted back to 
      Digital and is used to set standard requirements for future releases 
      of OpenVMS.

      The required disk space for installing the MPH software is approxi-
      mately 1,200 blocks. After installation, the MPH software requires 300
      blocks of disk space per node. For more information please refer to
      the OpenVMS Version 7.0 Release Notes.
   
   
      ASSOCIATED PRODUCTS
   
      OpenVMS Cluster Software
   
      OpenVMS Cluster Software is available for Alpha and VAX systems as a
      separately licensed System Integrated Product (SIP). It provides a 
      highly integrated OpenVMS computing environment that is distributed 
      over multiple systems which can contain up to 96 nodes.
   
      VMScluster systems communicate using any combination of the 
      following interconnects:
   
      o  Computer Interconnect (CI)
   
      o  DIGITAL Storage Systems Interconnect (DSSI)
   
      o  Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI)
   
      o  Ethernet
   
      o  Small Computer System Interface (SCSI)
   
      In addition, when configured with suitable FDDI bridges, VMScluster
      configurations can use DS3/T3 and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) 
      networking infrastructures.
   
      Applications running on one or more nodes in a VMScluster system share
      resources in a coordinated manner. While updating data, the 
      VMScluster software synchronizes access to shared resources, 
      preventing multiple processes on any node in the cluster from 
      interfering with each other. This coordination ensures data integrity
      during concurrent update transactions. Application programs specify 
      the level of VMScluster file sharing that is required; access is then
      coordinated by the extended QIO processor (XQP) and RMS.
   
                                       33
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      The OpenVMS queue manager controls the VMScluster batch and print 
      queues, which can be accessed by any node in the VMScluster. Batch 
      jobs submitted to VMScluster queues are routed to any available CPU 
      so that the batch load is shared.
   
      The Lock Manager provides synchronized services between systems in a
      cluster, for use both by system components such as RMS and XQP, and
      also for direct use by applications.
   
      Two or more Alpha and VAX computers connected to the same CI, DSSI,
      or SCSI interconnect must be configured as members of the same 
      VMScluster system. Mixed-architecture and mixed-version clusters 
      that contain both Alpha systems and VAX systems are supported.
   
      VMScluster systems provide a uniform computing environment that is 
      highly scalable, highly available, and secure. OpenVMS Cluster 
      Software implements a single-security environment within a cluster 
      configuration. The security subsystem ensures that all cluster-
      visible objects maintain consistent security profiles and that 
      system security auditing controls operate clusterwide.

      (SPD 29.78.xx) for more information.
   
      DECamds
   
      DECamds Version 7.0 is available on the OpenVMS distribution kit. 
      DECamds is a separately installable, real-time, high-performance mul-
      tisystem monitoring utility. It is supported on any system running 
      OpenVMS Version 7.0. The right to use DECamds is included under the 
      terms and conditions of the OpenVMS Cluster Software products (both 
      Alpha and VAX).
   
      DECamds provides system resource monitoring, investigation aid, and

      Volume Shadowing for OpenVMS
   
      Digital provides Volume Shadowing for OpenVMS Alpha and VAX products
      for performing disk mirroring operations, using a redundant arrays of
      independent disks (RAID) 1 storage strategy. In this description, 
      every use of Volume Shadowing for OpenVMS means both Volume Shadowing
      for OpenVMS Alpha and Volume Shadowing for OpenVMS VAX.
   
      Volume Shadowing for OpenVMS is a SIP that is separately licensed. 
      Volume Shadowing for OpenVMS provides high data availability for disk
      devices by ensuring against data loss that results from media deteri-
      oration or controller or device failure. This prevents storage sub-
      system component failures from interrupting system or application 
      tasks.
   
      The system disk and Files-11 On-Disk Structure 2 (ODS-2) data disks
      can be volume shadowed. Spiralog data disks can also be shadowed.
   
      Volume Shadowing for OpenVMS supports the clusterwide shadowing of 
      Digital SCSI and DSA storage systems. Volume Shadowing for OpenVMS 
      also supports shadowing of all mass storage control protocol (MSCP) 
      served DSA disks and Digital SCSI disks. All disks in a single shadow
      set must have the same number of logical blocks and the same physical
      geometry. Shadow set members can be located on a single system or any
      where in a VMScluster system. Disks can be configured on any MSCP- or
      Digital SCSI-compliant controller.
   
      Volume Shadowing for OpenVMS provides fault tolerance resulting from
      disk media errors or controller errors across the full range of 
      Alpha and VAX processors and configurations. Shadow set member units
      can be located on different controllers and OpenVMS Alpha and 
      OpenVMS VAX MSCP servers, providing configuration flexibility and a 
      high degree of data availability.
   
      Volume Shadowing for OpenVMS supports an unlimited number of single-
      member shadow sets and up to 400 disks in multi-member (2 or 3 mem-
      ber) shadow sets on a standalone or VMScluster system.

      Phase I of Volume Shadowing (also known as controller-based shadow-
      ing) which was available in the past on OpenVMS VAX, is no longer 
      supported.
   
      The binary kit for Volume Shadowing ships with the OpenVMS Alpha and
      VAX distribution kits. To run the software, customers need to purchase
      a license and documentation. Refer to the Volume Shadowing for Open-
      VMS Software Product Description (SPD 27.29.xx) for more information.
   
      DECnet/OSI and DECnet Software
   
      The DECnet software is a SIP that is licensed separately from the 
      OpenVMS operating system. Refer to the DECnet for OpenVMS VAX and 
      Alpha Software Product Description (SPD 48.48.xx) for further 
      information on supported communications devices and software features.
   
      DECnet/OSI is available as a layered product. The license for DECnet
      for OpenVMS Alpha and DECnet for OpenVMS VAX will also grant the 
      rights to use DECnet/OSI. Note that only one version of DECnet may 
      be active on a single system at any one time. Refer to the DECnet/OSI
      for OpenVMS Alpha Software Product Description (SPD 50.45.xx) and the
      DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS VAX Software Product Description 
      (SPD 25.03.xx) for further information on supported hardware 
      configurations and software features.
   
      Digital TCP/IP Software
   
      Internet networking is available through the Digital TCP/IP Services
      for OpenVMS layered product. This product provides TCP/IP networking,
      Network File System (NFS), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Remote Ter-
      minal Services (TELNET), and other features. Refer to the Digital 
      TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS Software Product Description 
      (SPD 46.46.xx) for further information.
   
      RMS Journaling for OpenVMS
   
      Digital provides the RMS Journaling for OpenVMS Alpha and VAX prod-
      ucts as separately-licensed SIPs that enable a system manager, user,
      or application to keep the data integrity of RMS files in the event
   
   
                                       36
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      of a number of failure scenarios. These journaling products protect
      RMS file data from becoming lost or inconsistent.
   
      RMS Journaling provides the following three types of journaling:
   
      o  After-image journaling. Provides the ability to reapply modifica-
         tions that have been made to a file. This type of journaling al-
         lows users to recover files that are inadvertently deleted, lost,
         or corrupted. RMS Journaling recovers the file by applying the 
         journaled modifications to a backup copy, thereby restoring its 
         final state. Application modifications are not necessary in order 
         to use after-image journaling.
   
      o  Before-image journaling. Provides the ability to reverse modifi-
         cations that have been made to a file. This type of journaling pro-
         vides the ability to return a file to a previous known state. This
         is useful in the event that a file is updated with incorrect or bad
         data. Application modifications are not necessary in order to use
         before-image journaling.
   
      o  Recovery unit journaling. Provides the ability to maintain trans-
         action integrity. A transaction can be defined as a series of file
         updates on one or more files. In the event of any failure during
         the transaction, recovery unit journaling rolls back the partially
         completed transaction to its starting point. This allows complex
         transactions to be completed as an atomic event-partially completed
         transactions can be avoided. Recovery unit journaling requires 
         application modification.
   
      The binary kit for RMS Journaling ships with the OpenVMS Alpha and VAX
      distribution kits. To run the software, customers need to purchase a
      license and documentation. Refer to the RMS Journaling for OpenVMS 
      Software Product Description (SPD 27.58.xx) for more information.
   
      DECram for OpenVMS
   
      DECram for OpenVMS, a separately orderable layered product, is a disk
      device driver that enables system managers to create pseudo disks 
      (RAMdisks)
   
   
   
                                       37
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      that reside in main memory for the purpose of improving I/O perfor-
      mance. Frequently accessed data can be accessed much faster from a 
      DECram device than from a physical disk device. These RAMdisks can be
      accessed through the file system just as physical disks are accessed,
      requiring no change to application or system software.
   
      Since main memory is allocated for the DECram device, an amount of ex-
      tra memory is required. The amount of memory dedicated is selectable.
      The system manager designates the amount of memory dedicated to the
      DECram device(s) and the files that will be stored on it. The maxi-
      mum size of a DECram device is 524,280 blocks. Refer to the DECram for
      OpenVMS Software Product Description (SPD 34.26.xx) for more infor-
      mation.
   
      DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS
   
      Digital offers a separately orderable layered product called DECwin-
      dows Motif for OpenVMS. This product provides support for both 
      OSF/Motif, a standards-based graphical user interface, and the X user
      interface (XUI) in a single run-time and development environment. 
      By default, DECwindows Motif displays the OSF/Motif user interface. 
      Because both Motif and XUI are based on MIT's X Window System, 
      applications written on either toolkit will run regardless of which 
      environment the user selects. Refer to the DECwindows Motif for 
      OpenVMS Software Product Description (SPD 42.19.xx) for information.
   
      The OpenVMS software installation procedure contains an optional step
      to install the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS workstation and font sup-
      port, which is required to run the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS lay-
      ered product. Refer to the OpenVMS Alpha Version 7.0 Upgrade and 
      Installation Manual or OpenVMS VAX Version 7.0 Upgrade and 
      Installation Manual for details concerning the optional installation 
      of the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS device support.
   
      Enhanced X Window System Display PostScript

      The X Window System Display PostScript system provided with 
      DECwindows Motif extends the native X graphical programming environ-
      ment for DECwindows users. This system allows users to display text 
      or images on workstations that support the XDPS extension. The 
      DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS layered product must be installed and 
      licensed in order to use Display PostScript.
   
      The X Window System Display PostScript has two components:
   
      o  Display PostScript server extension, which is provided with the 
         display server in the OpenVMS Alpha and OpenVMS VAX operating 
         systems.  A workstation is required to use this server.
   
      o  Adobe client libraries, which are used by applications to perform
         PostScript operations, such as rotating and scaling fonts, gener-
         ating curves, and displaying PostScript documents. The Adobe client
         libraries are available in the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS lay-
         ered product, as well as on third-party platforms, including IBM,
         Sun, and Silicon Graphics.
   
      X Display PostScript adds the following capabilities to the basic 
      X11R5 Window System environment:
   
      o  All DECwindows fonts can be displayed at any size and rotation 
         angle.
   
      o  Display PostScript graphics are specified in a user-defined coor-
         dinate system independent of monitor density.
   
      o  Color or gray-scale rendition is automatically modified to take ad-
         vantage of the monitor type through either direct display, color
         dithering, or half-toning.
   
      o  Display PostScript display routines can be downloaded to the server
         and executed on command.
   
      o  Sophisticated graphics primitives, such as precisely controlled 
         Bezier curves, can be displayed.

      The Display PostScript system also allows users to view PostScript 
      files with such applications as DECwindows Mail and the CDA Viewer 
      without generating hard copy. The Terms and Conditions for Display 
      PostScript can be found in the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS Software 
      Product Description (SPD 42.19.xx).
   
   
      CONFORMANCE TO STANDARDS
   
      OpenVMS is based on the following public, national, and international
      standards.
   
      POSIX Support and XPG4 BASE Profile Branding
   
      The OpenVMS environment, with POSIX for OpenVMS Version 2.0 and DEC
      C installed, extends the support for POSIX standards to include the
      X/Open BASE specifications defined in the X/Open Portability Guide,
      Issue 4 (XPG4). The XPG4 BASE specifications extend the system appli-
      cation programming interface and shell and utilities offered in the
      IEEE POSIX standards. XPG4 also includes standards-based internation-
      alization support.
   
      Platforms and components that successfully complete the branding pro-
      cess and pass X/Open Verification Test Suite for XPG4 (VSX4) are 
      awarded the X/Open XPG4 BASE Profile Brand. Components must pass a 
      series of more than 11,500 tests in VSX4 to earn the X/Open BASE 
      Profile Brand. These tests ensure that the OpenVMS environment with 
      POSIX for OpenVMS Version 2.0 and DEC C installed supports the 
      essential set of interfaces necessary in an open system.
   
      The inclusion of XPG4 BASE support in the OpenVMS environment gives
      application developers a broader set of standards-based portability
      features to incorporate into their applications. Most applications 
      that strictly conform to the POSIX and XPG4 specifications can be 
      developed on an OpenVMS system with POSIX for OpenVMS and the DEC C 
      compiler, and then ported without modification to any other platform 
      that also supports the same POSIX standards and XPG4 specifications.
   
      Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) Support
   
   
                                       40
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      The DCE for the OpenVMS product family provides a set of the distrib-
      uted computing features specified by the Open Software Foundation's 
      (OSF) DCE, as well as tools for application developers. With DCE, the
      OSF has established a standard set of services and interfaces that 
      facilitate the creation, use, and maintenance of client/server 
      applications. DCE for OpenVMS serves as the basis for an open 
      computing environment where networks of multivendor systems appear as
      a single system to the user. Because DCE makes the underlying net-
      works and operating systems transparent, application developers can 
      easily build portable, interoperable client/server applications. 
      Users can locate and share information safely and easily across the 
      entire enterprise. DCE for OpenVMS supplies system managers with a 
      set of tools to consistently manage the entire distributed computing 
      environment, while assuring the integrity of the enterprise.
   
      The DCE for OpenVMS product family currently consists of the follow-
      ing products:
   
      o  DCE Runtime Services for OpenVMS, which is required for all sys-
         tems participating in the DCE cell. The Runtime Services includes
         DCE client functions as well as DCE administration tools. DCE 
         Runtime Services provides client/server applications the ability to
         interoperate over DECnet, TCP/IP, and UDP/IP network protocols.
   
      o  DCE Application Developers' Kits for OpenVMS, which is required for
         developers of distributed applications but is optional for other
         users. The DCE Application Developers' Kit provides programmers 
         with an Interface Definition Language (IDL), an easy-to-use, 
         ANSI C-based language for writing remote procedure calls.
   
      o  DCE Cell Directory Service (CDS), one of which is required for each
         DCE cell. The DCE CDS is a central repository that contains infor-
         mation about the location of resources in the DCE cell. It allows
         access to resources by a single name, regardless of their physi-
         cal location.
   
      o  Digital DCE Security Server, one of which is required for each DCE.
         The DCE Security Server protects resources from illegal access and
         provides secure communications within and between DCE cells.
   
   
                                       41
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      The right-to-use the DCE Runtime Services is bundled with the 
      OpenVMS operating system base license. All other DCE products are 
      available as separate layered products. Refer to the Digital 
      Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) for OpenVMS Software Product 
      Description (SPD 43.05.xx) for more detailed information.
   
      Support for OSF/Motif and X Window System Standards
   
      DECwindows Motif provides support for OSF/Motif, a standards-based 
      graphical user interface, and the X Consortium's X Window System, 
      Version 11, Release 5 (X11R5) server.
   
      Standards Supported by OpenVMS
   
      The OpenVMS operating system is based on the public, national, and in-
      ternational standards listed below. These standards are developed by
      the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), U.S. Federal 
      Government (responsible for FIPS), Institute of Electrical and

      OpenVMS Alpha is distributed as a binary kit on CD-ROM. Procedures for
      setting up the system disk from media and for preparing the system for
      day-to-day operations are provided. The procedures use the POLYCENTER
      Software Installation utility to configure and install the OpenVMS Al-
      pha Version 7.0 operating system. These procedures are described in
      the OpenVMS Alpha Version 7.0 Upgrade and Installation Manual and 
      cover letter.
   
      OpenVMS VAX is distributed as binary kits on CD-ROM and tape. Proce-
      dures for setting up the system disk from a kit and for preparing the
      system for day-to-day operations are provided. The procedures are de-
      scribed in the OpenVMS VAX Version 7.0 Upgrade and Installation 
      Manual. Computer-specific information is contained in the upgrade and
      installation supplements for each family of VAX computers.
   
      POLYCENTER Software Installation
   
      The POLYCENTER Software Installation utility is now included in 
      OpenVMS. The utility is distributed with the OpenVMS Version 7.0 
      distribution kit, and the right to use the POLYCENTER software is 
      bundled with the OpenVMS operating system base license. The 
      POLYCENTER Software Installation utility simplifies the installation 
      and management of OpenVMS products.

      For system managers, the POLYCENTER Software Installation utility pro-
      vides DCL and DECwindows Motif interfaces which can be used to 
      install, configure, reconfigure, and deinstall software products 
      that have been prepared with the utility. In addition, the POLYCENTER
      software provides a database to track the installation, reconfig-
      uration, and deinstallation of software. For products installed with 
      other installation technologies, the POLYCENTER Software Installation
      utility provides a mechanism for adding information about them into 
      the POLYCENTER database. The POLYCENTER Software Installation 
      utility also provides the ability to manage dependencies between 
      products during the installation process.
   
      For software providers, the POLYCENTER software simplifies the task
      of packaging software by providing a simple, declarative language for
      describing material for the installation kit and defining how it is
      installed. The POLYCENTER Software Installation utility handles the
      functions, while the developer instructs the utility what to do. This
      significantly reduces the complexity and time to develop installation
      procedures. The language allows the developer to easily specify de-
      pendencies on other software, manage objects in the execution envi-
      ronment (such as files and directories), and anticipate and resolve
      conflict before it occurs. The POLYCENTER software also significantly
      simplifies the packaging of multiple software products into one 
      logical product.
   
      VMSINSTAL
   
      OpenVMS VAX includes the VMSINSTAL facility to automate operating sys-
      tem software updates, as well as to handle the installation of 
      optional Digital-supplied software products. OpenVMS Alpha includes 
      the VMSINSTAL facility to handle the installation of optional Digital
      -supplied software products that have not converted to PCSI.
   
      Test Package and Diagnostics
   
      OpenVMS includes a User Environment Test Package (UETP), which ver-
      ifies that the OpenVMS operating system is properly installed and 
      ready for use on the customer's systems.

      The minimum OpenVMS files listed above are for a system configuration
      where all optional features have been declined during the initial in-
      stallation. For most applications, this is not a realistic OpenVMS 
      environment.

      The paging, swap, and dump file requirements above are the minimum for
      a system with 32 MB of main memory. Additional memory in most cases
      adds to the space needed for these files, as will particular needs of
      your application. With careful system management it is possible to use
      the paging file space as a temporary dump file.
   
      For a VMScluster system disk, paging, swap, and dump files cannot be
      shared between nodes so the files must either be duplicated on the 
      system disk or located on some other disk.
   
      DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS Alpha Disk Space Requirements
   
      To support OpenVMS Alpha and DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS Alpha, a 
      system disk of greater than 380 MB is recommended. However, a subset 
      of DECwindows Motif can be installed. The disk space required for the
      installation of DECwindows Motif is 64 MB. The permanent amount of 
      space used is 62 MB. An additional 33 MB is needed to install the 
      DECwindow X11 Display Server and associated files. (These DECwindow 
      X11 Display Server and associated files are included in the OpenVMS 
      Alpha Version 7.0 media.) These disk space requirements are in 
      addition the disk space required for the OpenVMS Alpha Version 7.0 
      operating system as indicated in the OpenVMS Alpha Disk Space 
      Requirements table.
   
      Installation of the DECwindows Motif Version 1.2-3 layered product 
      gives customers the option of installing any or all of the following 
      components:
   
      o  User environment and applications - 34 MB. This section provides
         support for running DECwindows Motif applications on VAX servers.
   
      o  Programming support - 7 MB. This section includes support for the
         DEC C, DEC C++, DEC Fortran, Pascal, and VAX C programming 
         languages. If a subset of languages is installed, the amount of 
         disk space required will be less.
   
      o  Example files - approximately 7 MB.
   
      o  Translated image support - approximately 17 MB.
   
      Layered Product Disk Space Requirements

      In addition to the disk space used directly by Digital or third-party
      layered products, there may be additional space used to store infor-
      mation from those products in OpenVMS help libraries, command tables,
      object libraries and elsewhere. The exact amount of additional disk
      space required cannot be exactly predicted due to the possibility of
      recovering unused space already existing in those library files. Un-
      usually large modules contributed by layered products can also affect
      the amount of space required for upgrading to a new version of the 
      OpenVMS Alpha operating system.
   
   
      OpenVMS VAX DISK SPACE REQUIREMENTS
   
      Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 3)
   
      To support the complete OpenVMS VAX operating system environment, a
      system disk of greater than 150 MB is recommended. When a smaller disk
      is used, additional tailoring is required prior to installing some of
      the OpenVMS VAX options. This does not include the dump file space.
      Refer to the OpenVMS VAX Version 7.0 Upgrade and Installation Manual
      for information on tailoring.

      The above data was created from an installation on a VAXServer 2000
      with 6 MB of memory and an RD54 disk.
   
      Additional memory adds to the space required for page, swap, and dump
      files and the variable additional space increases with larger memory
      and disk.
   
      DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS VAX Disk Space Requirements
   
      To support OpenVMS VAX and the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS VAX lay-
      ered product, a system disk of greater than 225 MB is recommended. The
      disk space required for the installation of DECwindows Motif is 39 MB.
      The permanent amount of space used is 34 MB. An additional 16 MB are
      needed to install the DECwindows X11 Display Server and associated 
      files. (These DECwindows X11 Display Server and associated files are 
      included in the OpenVMS VAX Version 7.0 media.) These disk space 
      requirements

      are in addition to the 78 MB required for the other components of the
      OpenVMS VAX operating system environment. Refer to the OpenVMS VAX 
      Version 7.0 Upgrade and Installation Manual for details on tailoring 
      small system disks in order to support DECwindows Motif.
   
      Installation of the DECwindows Motif Version 1.2-3 layered product 
      gives customers the option of installing any or all of the following 
      components:
   
      o  User environment and applications - 22 MB. This section provides
         support for running DECwindows Motif applications on VAX servers.
   
      o  Programming support - 6 MB. This section includes support for the
         DEC C, DEC C++, DEC Fortran, Pascal, and VAX C programming 
         languages. If a subset of languages is installed, the amount of 
         disk space required is less.
   
      o  Example files - approximately 6 MB.
   
      Note that the individual sizes add up to more than the total because
      some components are shared by multiple portions of the environment.
   
      MEMORY SPACE REQUIREMENTS
   
      OpenVMS Alpha Memory Space Requirements
   
      The minimum amount of memory required to install, boot, and log in to
      an OpenVMS Alpha system is 32 MB. To ensure satisfactory performance
      for particular applications or numbers of users, additional memory may
      be required. Refer to specific layered product documentation for mem-
      ory requirements.
   
      OpenVMS VAX Memory Space Requirements
   
      The minimum amount of memory supported for an OpenVMS VAX environment
      is dependent upon the specific system(s) being used and the overall
      type of configuration and application requirements. The minimum amount
      of memory supported for a standalone VAX system running OpenVMS VAX
      Version 7.0 is 4 MB. The minimum amount of memory supported for a VAX
      workstation running OpenVMS VAX Version 7.0 is 12 MB.

      Note: These are the minimum memory requirements. More memory will be
      required for satisfactory performance of the operating system and 
      DECwindows Motif applications. The performance and memory usage of 
      DECwindows Motif systems is particularly sensitive to system config-
      uration and window and application usage. Remote execution of an 
      application requires an additional system that runs the application 
      while the display of the application occurs on the local workstation.
   
      Please refer to the associated layered product Software Product 
      Descriptions for their memory requirements. Please refer to the 
      OpenVMS VAX documentation for more information concerning performance
      considerations.

      DOCUMENTATION
   
      For OpenVMS Version 7.0, there will be one documentation set for both
      the Alpha and VAX platforms. Most manuals are common to both 
      platforms, although there are still some platform-specific manuals.
   
      OpenVMS offers documentation in a variety of formats:
   
      o  Online books (viewed using the DECwindows Motif Bookreader)
   
      For Version 7.0, online documentation will be distributed on a sep-
      arate CD-ROM that will ship with the OpenVMS Binary CD-ROMs. Customers
      will automatically receive the entire OpenVMS documentation offering
      in Bookreader format on the Documentation CD-ROM. Viewing online doc-
      umentation in Bookreader requires that DECwindows Motif be installed
      on the system and that a valid DECwindows Motif license be registered
      and loaded.
   
      o  Printed books (hardcopy)
   
                                       54
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      OpenVMS hardcopy documentation is made up of two offerings: the Open-
      VMS Full Documentation Set and the OpenVMS Base Documentation Set. A
      complete listing of all hardcopy manuals and their part numbers is 
      contained in the Overview of OpenVMS Documentation.
   
         -  Full Documentation Set
   
      The Full Documentation Set is for users who need extensive explana-
      tory information on all major OpenVMS components, complete reference
      information on system routines and utilities, detailed examples, 
      guidelines for VMScluster systems, programming concepts, a master 
      index, and information on the Help Message utility. This set meets 
      the needs of system managers and of system and application 
      programmers. It includes the Base Documentation Set.
   
         -  Base Documentation Set
   
      The Base Set includes the most commonly used OpenVMS manuals, address-
      ing the needs of general users and system managers of small standalone
      systems. Documents, such as the Release Notes, New Features, and the
      DCL Dictionary are included in the Base Set.
   
      Each book in these sets is also separately orderable.
   
      o  Printable files
   
      In addition to the online and hardcopy manuals, several OpenVMS 
      archived books will be offered as PostScript files on the OpenVMS 
      Documentation CD-ROM. For a complete listing of OpenVMS archived 
      books refer to the Overview of OpenVMS Documentation. These books 
      can be ordered separately and on demand through the Software Supply 
      Business (SSB) group.

      SOURCE LISTINGS
   
      OpenVMS Operating System Source Listings are available on CD-ROM. 
      These discs contain all source listings files and the Alpha specific 
      debug symbol tables that make up the OpenVMS operating system. 
      Digital provides source listings for all key modules of the OpenVMS 
      operating system that are appropriate for end users or application 
      developers. The debug symbol files (DSF) on the OpenVMS Alpha Source 
      Listings CD-ROM contain information used by the OpenVMS Alpha 
      System-Code Debugger. Certain company confidential source listings 
      and debug symbol files, however, are excluded from the CD-ROM.
   
      The orderable CD-ROM kit includes the license required to view these
      files on a standalone system or a VMScluster system. If users want to
      make these files available to another system (possibly at a remote 
      site), they need to purchase another kit.

      VAX Software Licenses
   
      The Operating System Base License is a prerequisite for all Concur-
      rent Use Licenses and all SMP BASE Extension Licenses. The Operating
      System Base License provides the right to use only the OpenVMS VAX or
      OpenVMS Alpha features of the current version. Interactive use of sys-
      tems licensed with and OpenVMS VAX or Alpha O/S Base License requires
      the addition of an OpenVMS Concurrent Use License (for one or more 
      users).

      Software License Information (VAX only)
   
      The OpenVMS VAX operating system uses one of two different categories
      of licenses depending on the hardware and software configurations used
      and currently supported. This information is also provided in the ap-
      plicable country's Price List.
   
                                       61
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      These are the two categories of operating system licenses for Open-
      VMS VAX:
   
      o  VAX VMS Licensing
   
      o  OpenVMS VAX Licensing
   
      Digital provides the proper license type with the purchase of the sys-
      tem. Not all license types are available for every system model.
   
      VAX VMS License Information
   
      Note: Effective February 6, 1995, the VAX VMS (UPI001) licenses no 
      longer include the rights for the Digital Rdb Run-Time option for 
      OpenVMS VAX, and do not permit use of Rdb Runtime on prior versions 
      of OpenVMS VAX.
   
      Each of the following licenses are for a specified hardware system,
      which is either the system the license was originally shipped with or
      the system on which the license was first used:
   
      o  Operating System Base License (QL-001**-**)
   
      o  Operating System User License for OpenVMS VAX (QL-001**-**)
   
      o  Traditional License for OpenVMS VAX (QL-001**-**)
   
      There are four types of VAX VMS licenses:
   
      1. Traditional License (QL-001A*-**)
   
      This type of license provides unlimited use to the users on a defined
      system. VAX VMS traditional licenses are sized to capacity according
      to system type.
   
      2. Multi-User License (QL-001A*-**)
   
      This type of license provides use according to a specified number of
      concurrent users. This is an activity-based license. The Multi-User
      License provides the customer with the right to use the operating sys-
      tem up to the limit of users specified in the license. An operating
      system "user" is a person who is logged in to the system and is us-
      ing the system interactively. This license is only available on lim-
      ited system models, primarily MicroVAX and VAX 4000 systems.
   
                                       62
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      Interactive use of VAX systems licensed with the Multi-User License
      may be increased by the addition of OpenVMS User Licenses* (for one
      or more users). Refer to the section on Ordering Information for fur-
      ther information.
   
      3. VAX VMS Workstation License (QL-001A*-**)
   
      This type of license provides use for a single user on a VAX worksta-
      tion. This license type allows one direct login for the single user
      and then one additional login for system management purposes only.
   
      Additional interactive use of VAX workstations licensed with the VAX
      VMS Workstation License requires the addition of an OpenVMS User Li-
      cense* (for one or more users). Refer to the section on Ordering In-
      formation for further information.
   
      4. File and Application Server License (QL-001A*-**)
   
      This type of license provides for the noninteractive use of OpenVMS.
   
      OpenVMS based VAXservers are sold with a File and Application Server
      License. The intent of an OpenVMS-based VAXserver is to provide file,
      print, application, and compute "services" to clients who have sub-
      mitted their requests remotely (for example via network/remote sub-
      mit/batch jobs, and so forth). This license type also allows one di-
      rect login for system management purposes only.
   
      Additional interactive use of OpenVMS VAXservers licensed with the 
      File and Application Server License requires the addition of an 
      OpenVMS User License* (for one or more users). Refer to the section 
      on Ordering Information for further information.
   
      This license grants the right to use the same version of the operat-
      ing system software as permitted for the corresponding Operating Sys-
      tem Base License at the time when the User License is installed.
   
      Notes: Not all VAX VMS license types are available for all versions of
      VMS, OpenVMS, or all VAX models.
   
      The OpenVMS VAX Individual Use Licenses are not supported by the VMS
      or OpenVMS VAX operating system releases prior to Version 5.5.
   
                                       63
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      OpenVMS VAX License Information
   
      There are five types of OpenVMS VAX licenses:
   
      1. OpenVMS VAX O/S Base License (QL-005A*-**)
   
      LMF Product Name: BASE-VMS-250136
   
      OpenVMS VAX O/S Base License grants the right to unrestricted, non-
      interactive use of the OpenVMS VAX operating system for the execution
      of remotely submitted requests for batch, print, application, and com-
      puting services, on a designated, single processor. This license au-
      thorizes one direct login for system management purposes only.
   
      The OpenVMS VAX Base License does not include the license right for
      the DEC Rdb Run-Time Option for OpenVMS VAX. The DEC Rdb for OpenVMS
      VAX Run-Time License is available separately.
   
      The Operating System Base License is a prerequisite for all Interac-
      tive User Licenses and all SMP Base Extension Licenses.
   
      Interactive use of systems licensed with an OpenVMS VAX O/S Base Li-
      cense requires the addition of an OpenVMS User License (for one or 
      more users). Refer to the section on Ordering Information for 
      further information.
   
      This license grants the right to use the same version of the operat-
      ing system software as permitted for the corresponding Operating Sys-
      tem Base License at the time when the User License is installed.
   
      The OpenVMS VAX O/S Base License also includes the license for 
      DECprint Supervisor for OpenVMS VAX. The DECprint Supervisor for 
      OpenVMS VAX has separate documentation, media kits, and service 
      products. Refer to SPD 44.15.xx for further details.
   
      2. Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP) Base Extension
         License (QL-005A9-6*)
   
      LMF Product Name: BASE-VMS-250136
   
   
                                       64
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      SMP Base Extensions extend the O/S Base License to enable symmetric
      multiprocessing capability on a select number of OpenVMS VAX systems
      supporting SMP. SMP Base Extensions are permanently tied to the O/S
      Base License and can not be separated from the
      O/S Base License if an SMP board is removed from the system.
   
      SMP Extensions grant the right to use the same version of the oper-
      ating system software as permitted for the corresponding O/S Base Li-
      cense at the time when the SMP Extension is granted.
   
      3. OpenVMS VAX Individual User License
         (QL-XULA*-**)
   
      LMF Product Name: VMS-USER
   
      The OpenVMS VAX Individual User License provides the right to inter-
      actively use the operating system by the specified or unlimited num-
      ber of concurrent users on a designated, single processor. A user is
      an individual who is logged in to a processor and is interactively us-
      ing the operating system software by means other than a login. An 
      OpenVMS VAX O/S Base License or one of the five types of VAX VMS 
      Licenses (QL-001A*-**) is a prerequisite for the OpenVMS User License.
   
      This license grants the right to use the same version of the operat-
      ing system software as permitted for the corresponding Operating Sys-
      tem Base License at the time when the User License is installed.
   
      The OpenVMS VAX O/S Base, the SMP Base Extension, and Interactive User
      licenses are not supported by the VMS or OpenVMS VAX operating sys-
      tem releases prior to OpenVMS VAX Version 5.5.
   
      4. OpenVMS VAX Distributed Interactive User License
         (QL-09SA*-**)
   
      LMF Product Name: ADL-USER
   
      This license grants the right to interactive use of the OpenVMS VAX
      operating system, provided the appropriate Operating System Base Li-
      cense or one of the five types of VAX VMS Licenses has been previously
      installed on a VAX system. The Distributed Interactive User licenses
      are concurrent use licenses and are available in any quantity, except
   
                                       65
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      unlimited. Distributed Interactive User licenses are mobile (redes-
      ignatable) and may be installed and used on a single OpenVMS VAX pro-
      cessor or shared in a single OpenVMS VAXcluster.
   
      A Distributed Interactive user is defined as an individual who is 
      logged in to an OpenVMS VAX processor or OpenVMS VAXcluster or is 
      interactively using the operating system software by means other 
      than a login.
   
      This license grants the right to use the same version of the operat-
      ing system software as permitted for the corresponding Operating Sys-
      tem Base License at the time when the User License is installed.
   
      5. OpenVMS Concurrent Use License (For both VAX and Alpha)
         (QL-MT3A*-3*)
   
      LMF Product Name: OPENVMS-ALPHA-USER-ADL
   
      This license grants the right to interactive use of the OpenVMS op-
      erating system, provided the appropriate OpenVMS Operating System Base
      License is installed on an OpenVMS VAX processor, or on an OpenVMS Al-
      pha processor, or on OpenVMS VAX processors if one of the five types
      of VAX VMS Licenses has been previously installed on a VAX system. The
      OpenVMS Concurrent Use Licenses are available in any quantity desired
      except unlimited. OpenVMS Concurrent Use Licenses are mobile (redes-
      ignatable) and may be installed and used on a single OpenVMS VAX or
      OpenVMS Alpha processor, or shared in a single OpenVMS VAXcluster, a
      single OpenVMS Cluster, or shared in a mixed OpenVMS Cluster.
   
      A user that enables a Concurrent Use License is defined as an indi-
      vidual who is logged in to an OpenVMS VAX processor, or an OpenVMS Al-
      pha processor, or an OpenVMS VAXcluster, or an OpenVMS Cluster, or a
      mixed OpenVMS Cluster and/or is interactively using the OpenVMS op-
      erating system software by means other than a login.
   
      When an OpenVMS VAX SMP System upgrade is performed, the SMP Exten-
      sion to the OpenVMS Alpha Operating System License permits the use of
      all existing Distributed Interactive User Licenses on the upgraded 
      system.
   
   
                                       66
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      The Operating System Base License provides the right to use only the
      OpenVMS features of the current or prior versions of the OpenVMS op-
      erating system.
   
      This license grants the right to use the same version of the operat-
      ing system software as permitted for the corresponding Operating Sys-
      tem Base License at the time when the User License is installed.
   
      OpenVMS Alpha License Information
   
      There are five types of OpenVMS licenses available on Alpha proces-
      sors.
   
      1. Operating System Base License (QL-MT1A*-6*)
   
      LMF Product Name: OpenVMS-ALPHA
   
      This license grants the right to noninteractive use of the remote 
      batch, print, application, and computing services of the OpenVMS 
      Alpha operating system on a single processor. This license 
      authorizes one direct login for system management purposes only.
   
      The Operating System Base License is a prerequisite for OpenVMS User
      Licenses and SMP Base Extension Licenses.
   
      The Operating System Base License provides the right to use only the
      OpenVMS features of the current or prior versions of the OpenVMS Op-
      erating System.
   
      2. Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP) Base Extension License (QL-MT1A9-
         6*)
   
      LMF Product Name: OpenVMS-ALPHA
   
      SMP Base Extensions extend the Operating System Base License to en-
      able symmetric multiprocessing capability on those OpenVMS Alpha sys-
      tems supporting SMP. SMP Base Extensions are permanently tied to the
      Operating System Base License and may not be separated from the Op-
      erating System Base License if an SMP board is removed from the sys-
      tem.
   
                                       67
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      SMP Extensions grant the right to use the same version of the oper-
      ating system software as permitted for the corresponding Operating 
      System Base License at the time when the SMP Extension is granted.
   
      3. Individual User License (QL-MT2A*-**)
            (No Longer Offered)
   
      LMF Product Name: OpenVMS-ALPHA-USER
   
      This license grants the right to interactive use of the OpenVMS Al-
      pha operating system, provided the appropriate Operating System Base
      License has been previously installed on the OpenVMS Alpha system. The
      Individual User Licenses are available in any quantity desired or as
      an unlimited user license.
   
      Individual User Licenses are redesignatable and may be installed and
      used on a single OpenVMS Alpha processor only. They may not be shared
      in a single OpenVMS Alpha VMScluster environment. An Individual user
      is defined as an user who is logged in an OpenVMS Alpha processor or
      is interactively using the operating system software by means other
      than a login.
   
      This license grants the right to use the same version of the operat-
      ing system software as permitted for the corresponding Operating Sys-
      tem Base License at the time when the User License is installed.
   
      4. OpenVMS Alpha Distributed Interactive User License (QL-MT3A*-**)
            (No Longer Offered)
   
      LMF Product Name: OpenVMS-ALPHA-ADL
   
      This license grants the right to interactive use of the OpenVMS Al-
      pha operating system, provided the appropriate Operating System Base
      License has been previously installed on an Alpha system. The ADL In-
      teractive User Licenses, are concurrent use licenses and are avail-
      able in any quantity desired except unlimited. ADL Interactive User
      Licenses are redesignatable and may be installed and used on a sin-
      gle OpenVMS Alpha processor, or shared in a single OpenVMS Cluster en-
      vironment.
   
   
                                       68
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      A Distributed Interactive user is defined as an individual who is 
      logged in to an OpenVMS Alpha processor or OpenVMS Cluster or is 
      interactively using the operating system software by means other 
      than a login.
   
      This license grants the right to use the same version of the operat-
      ing system software as permitted for the corresponding Operating Sys-
      tem Base License at the time when the User License is installed.
   
      5. OpenVMS Concurrent Use License (For both VAX and Alpha) (QL-MT3A*-
         3*)
   
      LMF Product Name: OPENVMS-ALPHA-USER-ADL
   
      This license grants the right to interactive use of the OpenVMS op-
      erating system, provided the appropriate OpenVMS Operating System Base
      License in installed on an OpenVMS VAX processor, and/or on an Open-
      VMS Alpha processor, or on OpenVMS VAX processors if one of the five
      types of VAX VMS Licenses has been previously installed on a VAX sys-
      tem. The OpenVMS Concurrent Use licenses are available in any quan-
      tity desired except unlimited. OpenVMS Concurrent Use Licenses are mo-
      bile (redesignatable) and may be installed and used on a single Open-
      VMS VAX or OpenVMS Alpha processor, or shared in a single OpenVMS VAX-
      cluster, a single OpenVMS Cluster, or shared in a mixed OpenVMS Clus-
      ter.
   
      A user that enables a Concurrent Use License is defined as an indi-
      vidual who is logged in to an OpenVMS VAX processor, or an OpenVMS Al-
      pha processor, or an OpenVMS VAXcluster, or an OpenVMS Cluster, or a
      mixed OpenVMS Cluster and/or is interactively using the OpenVMS op-
      erating system software by means other than a login.
   
      When an Alpha SMP System upgrade is performed, the SMP Base Extension
      to the OpenVMS Alpha Operating System License permits the use of all
      existing User Licenses on the upgraded system.
   
      This license grants the right to use the same version of the operat-
      ing system software as permitted for the corresponding Operating Sys-
      tem Base License at the time when the User License is installed.
   
      License Management Facility Support
   
                                       69
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
      The OpenVMS operating system supports Digital's License Management Fa-
      cility (LMF).
   
      If an OpenVMS license is not registered and activated using LMF, then
      only a single login is permitted for system management purposes 
      through the system console (OPA0:).
   
      Several of the VAX VMS and OpenVMS VAX license types are based on the
      number of concurrent users, called an activity license. Every prod-
      uct has the option to define an activity as related to the LMF. Open-
      VMS Interactive User and ADL Interactive User Licenses define the num-
      ber of concurrent users that are activity licenses as defined by the
      LMF. OpenVMS defines activities, sometimes referred to as an OpenVMS
      "user", as follows:
   
      o  Each remote terminal connection is considered an activity. This is
         true even if users set host to their local nodes (SET HOST 0).
   
      o  Each connection from a terminal server is considered an activity.
   
      o  A multiple-window session on a workstation is considered one ac-
         tivity, regardless of the number of windows.
   
      o  A batch job is not considered an activity.
   
      o  A remote network connection that is a connection other than a re-
         mote terminal connection, is not considered an activity.

      ers Guide.
   
      Refer to the following SPDs for detailed product information: DECnet
      for OpenVMS (SPD 48.48.xx), DECnet/OSI (SPD 50.45.xx, 25.03.xx), and
      OpenVMS Cluster Software (SPD 29.78.xx).
   
      Terminals and Terminal Line Interfaces
   
      To prevent input from overflowing a buffer, terminals use the ASCII
      control characters DC1 and DC3 for synchronization as defined by Dig-
      ital's DEC STD 111, Revision A. VXT windowing terminals support stan-
      dard ANSI applications and X windows using the LAT transport proto-
      col.
   
      The following table lists the terminals that are supported by Open-
      VMS Alpha:
   
      VT200          VT300          VT400 series
      series         series
   
      VT500          VXT2000
      series         series
   
      The following table lists the terminals that are supported by Open-
      VMS VAX:
   
      VT52           VT100-         LA-series
                     series
   
      VT300-         VT1000-        LQP02
      series         series
   
      VT200-         VT500-
      series         series
   
      Terminals on Professional 350, Rainbow 100, and DECmate II systems em-
      ulate VT100 terminals.
   
      Only limited support is available for the VT52. The VT131, when run-
      ning an application, operates in block mode. When interacting with 
      OpenVMS VAX and associated utilities, the VT131 operates only in 
      VT100 (or interactive) mode and not in block mode.

      Note: The VT1000 is a monochrome windowing terminal that supports 
      standard ANSI applications and "X" windows. The transport protocols 
      supported are LAT for VMS. The product supports 15-inch and 19-inch 
      monitors.

      PRODUCT NAME:  OpenVMS Operating System for VAX and Alpha, Version 6.2
      SPD's 25.01.45
   
      Note: This Software Product Description describes OpenVMS Operating 
      System Software for the Alpha and VAX computer family. Except where 
      explicitly noted the features described in this SPD apply equally to
      Alpha and VAX systems. OpenVMS Alpha and OpenVMS VAX operating system
      licenses and part numbers are architecture specific; please refer to
      the Ordering Information section of this SPD for further details.
   
      DESCRIPTION
   
      OpenVMS is a general-purpose multiuser operating system that runs in
      both production and development environments. OpenVMS Alpha supports
      Digital Equipment Corporation's Alpha series computers, while OpenVMS
      VAX supports VAX, MicroVAX, VAXstation, and VAXserver series comput-
      ers. OpenVMS software supports industry standards, facilitating ap-
      plication portability and interoperability. OpenVMS provides symmet-
      ric multiprocessing (SMP) support for multiprocessing Alpha and VAX
      systems.
   
      The OpenVMS operating system can be tuned to perform well in a wide
      variety of applications, including compute-intensive, I/O-intensive,
      client/server, real-time, and combinations of those and other envi-
      ronments. Actual performance depends on the type of computer, avail-
      able physical memory, and the number and type of disk and tape drives
      on the
      system.
   
      OpenVMS has well-integrated networking, distributed computing and 
      client/server, multiprocessing, and windowing capabilities. OpenVMS 
      contains extensive features that promote ease-of-use, improve the 
      productivity of programmers, and facilitate system management.

      OpenVMS Operating System for VAX and Alpha, Version 6.2  25.01.45
   
   
      OpenVMS is an open software environment that supports key standards
      such as OSF/Motif, POSIX, XPG4, and the OSF Distributed Computing En-
      vironment (DCE). The right to use POSIX for OpenVMS and the DCE Run-
      time Services for OpenVMS is bundled with the OpenVMS operating sys-
      tem base license. DECwindows Motif is available exclusively as a sep-
      arate layered product.
   
      OpenVMS Alpha Version 6.2 and OpenVMS VAX V6.2 are functional releases
      of the OpenVMS operating system for Digital's Alpha and VAX systems
      respectively. These releases include a number of new features, 
      enhancements and expanded hardware support. Refer to the OpenVMS 
      Version 6.2 New Features Manual for details.
   
      OpenVMS Alpha compilers and applications take advantage of 64 bits by
      using 64-bit data types. Consult the Software Product Descriptions of
      OpenVMS Alpha compilers for further details. Note that application 
      virtual address space is a 32-bit implementation for 
      compatibility and migration purposes.
   
      User Environment
   
      Users can access OpenVMS software by using the English-like DIGITAL
      Command Language (DCL), the command language for OpenVMS that is 
      supplied with the system. DCL commands take the form of a command name
      followed by parameters and qualifiers. DCL commands provide informa-
      tion about the system, initiate system utilities, and initiate user
      programs. OpenVMS prompts users to enter required DCL parameters, mak-
      ing it easy for novice users.
   
      Users can enter DCL commands at a terminal or include them in command
      procedures. Command procedures can be run interactively or submitted
      to a batch queue for deferred execution.
   
      Information on DCL and OpenVMS utilities is available through the on-
      line OpenVMS Help system. Online Help includes summary operational in-
      formation on all aspects of system operation.
   
      A number of tools and utilities are integrated into the OpenVMS op-
      erating system. They include:

      Text Processing
   
      The Extensible Versatile Editor (EVE), one of several text editors 
      supplied by Digital, is the default editor for OpenVMS. EVE allows 
      users to insert, change, and delete text quickly. Written in the DEC
      Text Processing Utility language (DECTPU), EVE is a full-screen 
      editor that allows users to scroll through text on a terminal screen.
      EVE provides an EDT-style keypad, allowing EDT users to move to EVE 
      easily. EDT is also supported on OpenVMS Alpha Version 6.2 and 
      OpenVMS VAX Version 6.2.
   
      Mail Utility
   
      The Mail utility allows users to send messages to any other user on
      the system. Multinode operation is available if DECnet or DECnet/OSI
      is installed and
      licensed on each participating node on the configured network.
   
      Command-Level Programming
   
      Command-level programming allows users to create special files called
      command procedures that contain a series of DCL commands. When users
      execute a command procedure, the system consecutively processes the
      commands in the command procedure. Users can also use special DCL com-
      mands to assign symbolic names, evaluate numerical and logical expres-
      sions, accept parameters, communicate interactively with the user in-
      voking the command procedure, perform conditional (IF-THEN-ELSE) and
      branching (GOTO) logic, and handle error conditions.
   
      User Environment Tailoring
   
      Users can customize the computing environment with user login command
      procedures, shorthand commands, binding of commands to function keys,
      and command recall and editing.
   
      Terminal Fallback Facility (TFF)

      OpenVMS Operating System for VAX and Alpha, Version 6.2  25.01.45
   
   
      This facility allows Digital 7-bit terminals to input and output the
      DEC Multinational character set (MCS). Specific tables allow conver-
      sion for a number of different 7-bit National Replacement Character
      sets, such as French, German, Spanish, and Swedish, to MCS. TFF also
      allows character composition on terminals that do not have the com-
      pose key.
   
      National Character Set (NCS) Utility
   
    This utility allows users to define non-ASCII string collating sequences
      and to define conversion functions. Conversion functions use conver-
      sion algorithms to change an input string; for example, to change low-
      ercase characters to uppercase. NCS also allows RMS indexed files to
      be collated using user-specified collating sequences.
   
      Program Development Environment
   
      OpenVMS includes a comprehensive set of tools for developing programs,
      including run-time libraries (RTLs), a linker, a librarian, and a sym-
      bolic debugger. The assembly-level VAX MACRO language is supplied with
      OpenVMS VAX. Tools available to the OpenVMS programmer include the 
      following:
   
      Language and Run-Time Library Support
   
      OpenVMS includes several run-time libraries (RTLs) that provide string
      manipulation, parallel processing support, I/O routines, I/O conver-
      sion, terminal-independent screen handling, date and time formatting
      routines, highly accurate mathematical functions, signaling and con-
      dition handling, and other general-purpose functions.
   
      On OpenVMS VAX, these routines can be called from programs written in
      such languages as VAX MACRO, VAX Ada, VAX BASIC, VAX BLISS-32 Imple-
      mentation Language, VAX C, DEC C, DEC C++, VAX COBOL, VAX DIBOL, VAX 
      FORTRAN, VAX Pascal, VAX PL/I, and VAX SCAN.

      OpenVMS Operating System for VAX and Alpha, Version 6.2  25.01.45
   
   
      On OpenVMS Alpha, these routines can be called from programs written
      in such languages as MACRO-64, DEC Ada, DEC BASIC, DEC C, DEC C++, DEC
      COBOL, DEC Fortran, DEC Pascal, and DEC PL/1.
   
     Also included in OpenVMS Alpha are language-support libraries. While
     each language is different, all provide support for sequential file
     I/O and most support direct and indexed file I/O as well. Language RTLs
     also provide support for I/O formatting, error handling, and in DEC
     Fortran, the ability to read unformatted files containing data from
     other vendors.
   
      Run-Time Libraries are provided to support Translated Images created
      from user mode images built on OpenVMS VAX Version 4.0 through Ver-
      sion 5.5-2. Depending on the method used to create the VAX image, 
      these Run-Time Libraries may be useful for images built on later 
      versions of OpenVMS VAX, which do not use features which were 
      developed since OpenVMS VAX Version 5.5-2.
   
      Translated Images Run-Time Libraries are used to support a few archi-
      tectural features (such as VAX D-float and H-float), which differ be-
      tween VAX and Alpha systems, and support programs converted to run on
      Alpha systems before native Alpha compilers were available for par-
      ticular programming languages.
   
      Many Digital languages (including those listed previously) adhere to
      the common calling standard, meaning that routines written in any of
      these languages can directly call routines written in any other lan-
      guage. Development of applications using multiple languages is sim-
      ple and straightforward.
   
      All user accessible routines in the Run-Time Libraries follow the 
      OpenVMS Alpha or OpenVMS VAX calling standard and condition-handling
      conventions, and most are contained within shareable images.
   
      At a lower level, programs can call system services directly for se-
      curity, event flag, asynchronous system trap, logical name, record and
      file I/O, process control, timer, time conversion, condition handling,
      lock management, and memory management services. Again, system ser-
      vices use the OpenVMS VAX or OpenVMS Alpha calling standard and 
      condition-handling conventions.

      OpenVMS supports execution of user mode images created on earlier ver-
      sions of OpenVMS. Recompiling and relinking typically are not required.
   
      Macro-32 Compiler - Alpha
   
      The Macro-32 compiler for OpenVMS Alpha is supplied with OpenVMS Al-
      pha software for migration purposes.
   
      DECthreads
   
      OpenVMS includes a user-mode multithreading capability referred to as
      DECthreads. DECthreads provides an implementation of draft 4 of the
      proposed POSIX 1003.4a standard and is Digital's implementation of the
      Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) Threads as defined by the Open
      Software Foundation. DECthreads is a library of run-time routines that
      allows the user to create multiple threads of execution within a sin-
      gle address space. Multithreading capability allows computation ac-
      tivity to be overlapped with I/O activity. Synchronization elements,
      such as mutexes and condition variables, are provided to help ensure
      that shared resources are accessed correctly. DECthreads also provides
      multiple scheduling policies for scheduling and prioritizing threads.
      DECthreads is supported by the OpenVMS debugger, to aid in the debug-
      ging of multithreaded applications.
   
      Librarian Utility
   
      The Librarian utility permits storage of object modules, image files,
      macros, Help text, or any general record-oriented information in cen-
      tral, easily accessible files. Object module and image file libraries
      are searched by the linker when the linker finds a reference it can-
      not resolve in one of its input files. Alpha macro libraries are 
      searched by the Macro-32 compiler and Macro-64 assembler when either 
      finds a macro name that is not defined in the input file. VAX macro 
      libraries are searched by the assembler when the assembler finds a 
      macro that is not defined in the input file.

      OpenVMS Operating System for VAX and Alpha, Version 6.2  25.01.45
   
   
      The OpenVMS Debugger allows users to trace program execution as well
      as display and modify register contents using the same symbols that
      are present in the source code.
   
      Alpha System-Code Debugger
   
     The OpenVMS Alpha System-Code Debugger is a kernel code debugger. It
     allows a system code developer to trace the execution of nonpageable
     system code at any IPL (Interrupt Priority Level). Based on the OpenVMS
     Alpha Debugger, the system-code debugger uses the same interface and
     a majority of the same command set.
   
      System Dump Analyzer
   
      In the event of a system failure, OpenVMS will write the contents of
      memory to a pre-allocated dump file. This dump file can later be an-
      alyzed using the System Dump Analyzer (SDA). System dumps can either
      be full memory dumps, where all memory is written, or selective mem-
      ory dumps, where only memory in use at the time of the system fail-
      ure is written. Full memory dumps require a dump file big enough to
      hold all memory. Selective memory dumps will write as much of the mem-
      ory in use at the time of the system failure that will fit into the
      dump file, which can therefore be much smaller in size.
   
      OpenVMS for Alpha supports selective dumps on systems configured with
      any supported amount of memory. Full dumps are only supported on sys-
      tems configured with up to 4 GB of memory.
   
      RMS File Utilities
   
      RMS file utilities allow users to analyze the internal structure of
      an RMS file and to determine the most appropriate set of parameters
      for an RMS file. These utilities can also be used to create, load, and
      reclaim space in an RMS file. Refer to the Operating System Environ-
      ment section of this Software Product Description for more informa-
      tion on RMS.
   
     File Differences Utility
   
     This utility compares the contents of two files and lists those records
     that do not match.

      Translated Image Environment - Alpha
   
      OpenVMS Alpha provides an array of services to allow the operation of
      programs that have undergone binary translation from OpenVMS VAX im-
      ages. These programs can perform virtually all user-mode functions on
      OpenVMS Alpha, and can operate in combination with other programs (im-
      ages) that have been translated from OpenVMS VAX or have been built
      using native compilers on OpenVMS Alpha. Without requiring special 
      source code, the Translated Image Environment resolves differences 
      between the VAX and Alpha architectures, including floating-point 
      registers, condition codes, exception handling, ASTs, and so forth.
   
      The Translated Image Environment included with OpenVMS Alpha is suf-
      ficient to run such images that have been translated elsewhere. The
      DECmigrate for OpenVMS AXP layered product can be used to translate
      user mode OpenVMS VAX images. For additional information on the pre-
      cise characteristics of programs suitable for binary translation, re-
      fer to the DECmigrate for OpenVMS AXP Systems Software Product 
      Description (SPD 39.44.xx).
   
      System Management Environment
   
      OpenVMS provides a variety of features to aid the system manager in
      configuring and maintaining an optimal system. Features available for
      the system manager include the following:
   
      OpenVMS Management Station V1.0
   
      The new OpenVMS Management Station enables user account management on
      one or more VMScluster systems from a single Windows-based PC. It pro-
      vides the ability to perform management tasks across multiple systems,
      making it possible to easily modify many accounts in a single oper-
      ation. It provides a comprehensive interface to the user account man-
      agement features of AUTHORIZE, DISKQUOTA, and some DCL directory main-
      tenance commands, transparently enabling the steps of adding a UAF en-
      try, granting rights identifiers, creating a directory, disk quota,
   
   
   
   
   
                                       8
  
   
   
   
   
      OpenVMS Operating System for VAX and Alpha, Version 6.2  25.01.45
   
   
      and mail profile. In addition, the Management Station also allows cre-
      ation of network proxy records and supports storing personal infor-
      mation such as phone number, location, and site-specific identifica-
      tion.
   
      The Management Station supports the account management operations of
      account creation, modification, and deletion as well as renaming ac-
      counts and displaying account attributes.
   
      The following are V1.0 restrictions with regard to managing OpenVMS
      systems:
   
      o  Managing OpenVMS Cluster members as individual nodes is not sup-
         ported. OpenVMS Cluster systems are treated as indivisible enti-
         ties; an operation cannot be performed on particular cluster mem-
         bers.
   
      o  OpenVMS Clusters with multiple user authorization files (UAFs) are
         not supported.
   
      o  The PCs currently support DECnet Phase IV only. However, due to the
         built-in backward compatability between DECnet/OSI and DECnet Phase
         IV this does not impose any restrictions on operations between a
         PC client and the server, as long as the node addresses are within
        the Phase IV address space (maximum 63 areas with maximum 1023 nodes
         per area).
   
     The Management Station is a client/server application based on PATH-
     WORKS ManageWORKS. The PC client requires Microsoft[R] Windows[TM] V3.1
     (or Microsoft Windows for Workgroups V3.11) and PATHWORKS V5.0A or V5.1
     for DOS and Windows client which includes ManageWORKS. The PATHWORKS
     server is not required. The Management Station server component must
     be installed on OpenVMS VAX Version 6.1 or higher, or OpenVMS Alpha
     Version 6.2 or higher. The Management Station software is included un-
      der the OpenVMS base license.
   
      InfoServer Tape Backup
   
      With Version 6.1 of the OpenVMS operating system, system managers can
      now back up and restore the system disk to tapes connected to an In-
      foServer system.

      Batch and Print Queuing System
   
      OpenVMS provides an extensive batch and print capability that allows
      the creation of queues and the setup of spooled devices in order to
      process noninteractive workloads in parallel with timesharing or real-
      time jobs.
   
      The OpenVMS batch and print operations support two types of queues:
      generic queues and execution queues. A generic queue is an interme-
      diate queue that holds a job until an appropriate execution queue be-
      comes available to initiate the job. An execution queue is a queue 
      through which the job (either print or batch) is actually processed 
      or executed.
   
     The system queues batch jobs for execution. The system manager can reg-
     ulate the number of queues and the number of streams per queue (that
     is, the number of batch jobs in the queue that can execute 
     concurrently).
   
    Both generic and execution batch queues can have different attributes,
    such as the maximum CPU time permitted, working set size, and prior-
    ity. Facilities are provided for starting and stopping queues and for
    starting and stopping jobs in a queue. Because multiple execution queues
      can be associated with a generic queue, OpenVMS VAX enables load bal-
      ancing across available CPUs in a VMScluster system, increasing over-
      all system throughput.
   
      Print queues, both generic and execution, together with queue manage-
      ment facilities, provide versatile print capabilities, including sup-
      port of ANSI and PostScript[R] file printing.
   
      Accounting Utility
   
      For accounting purposes, OpenVMS keeps records of system resource us-
      age. These statistics include processor and memory utilization, I/O
      counts, print symbiont line counts, image activation counts, and pro-
      cess termination records. The OpenVMS Accounting utility allows var-
      ious reports to be generated using this data.
   
      Audit Analysis Utility
   
   
                                       10
  
   
   
   
   
      OpenVMS Operating System for VAX and Alpha, Version 6.2  25.01.45
   
   
     For security auditing purposes, OpenVMS selectively records critical
     security-relevant events in the system security audit log file. These
     records contain the date and time the event occurred, the identity of
     the associated user process, and information specific to each event
     type. This information is intended to aid the system manager in main-
     taining system security and to deter possible intruders. The OpenVMS
     Audit Analysis utility allows various reports to be generated from this
     data.
   
      Autoconfigure/AUTOGEN Utilities
   
     OpenVMS provides utilities to automatically configure the available
     devices into the system tables and to set system operational param-
     eters based on the detected peripheral and memory configuration. There
     is no need for a traditional "system generation" process when the hard-
     ware configuration is expanded or otherwise modified.
   
     The OpenVMS Alpha AUTOGEN command procedure automatically sets a num-
     ber of system parameters by detecting devices installed in a config-
     uration. A feedback option can be used to generate a report of rec-
     ommended parameter settings based on previous usage patterns.
   
     Backup Utility
   
    The Backup utility provides full volume and incremental file backup
    for file-structured, mounted volumes and volume sets. Individual files,
    selected directory structures, or all files on a volume set can be 
    backed up and restored. Files can be selected by various dates 
    (creation, modification, etc.). Files can be backed up to magnetic 
    tape, magnetic disk, or WORM (Write Once Read Many) optical disk. The 
    Backup utility can be used to restore a save set or list the contents 
    of a save set.
   
      Backup Manager for OpenVMS provides a screen-oriented interface to the
      Backup utility which assists users in performing routine Backup op-
      erations.

      OpenVMS Operating System for VAX and Alpha, Version 6.2  25.01.45
   
   
      Backup Manager is menu-driven and provides:
   
      o  Access to Backup's save, restore, and list operations without hav-
         ing to understand Backup command syntax
   
     o  The ability to create, modify, recall and delete Backup Manager 
       "templates" describing Backup save operations
   
      Backup Manager will work on all supported OpenVMS configurations with
      a video terminal. It uses the Screen Management (SMG) RTL routines to
      provide a window- like user interface. The software does not assume
      any particular privilege on the part of its user beyond access to the
      files and devices being operated upon.
   
      Standalone Backup Utility - VAX
   
      Standalone BACKUP provides a mechanicsm for system managers to back
      up and restore system disks. Standalone BACKUP can also be used dur-
      ing the installation of the OpenVMS VAX operating system.
   
      Analyze Disk Structure Utility
   
      The Analyze Disk Structure utility compares the structure information
      on a disk volume with the contents of the disk, prints the structure
      information, and permits changes to that information. It also can be
     used to repair errors that are detected in the file structure of disks.
   
      Monitor Utility
   
      The Monitor utility permits the system manager to monitor different
      classes of systemwide performance data, including process activity,
      I/O activity, memory management activity, vector processing activity
      (VAX), and two phase commit transaction activity at specified inter-
      vals. The data may be displayed as it is gathered or saved in a file
      for later use.
   
      License Management Facility (LMF)
   
      The License Management Facility (LMF) allows the system manager to en-
      able software licenses and to determine which software products are
      licensed on an OpenVMS system.

      OpenVMS Operating System for VAX and Alpha, Version 6.2  25.01.45
   
   
      System Management Utility (SYSMAN)
   
    SYSMAN allows the system manager to define a system management envi-
    ronment so that operations performed from the local OpenVMS system can
    be executed on all other OpenVMS systems in the defined environment.
    The environment may include OpenVMS Alpha and VAX systems configured
    in a VMScluster, or multiple systems networked via DECnet or DECnet/OSI.
   
      Operations
   
    OpenVMS enables varying levels of privilege to be assigned to differ-
    ent operators. In addition, system-generated messages can be routed
    to different terminals based on their interest to the console oper-
    ators, tape librarians, security administrators, and system managers.
    Operators can use the OpenVMS Help Message utility to obtain online
    error messages descriptions.
   
    Security
   
    Digital achieved a C2 security rating for OpenVMS VAX 6.0 and a B1 se-
    curity rating for SEVMS VAX V6.0 in 1993 and is currently participat-
    ing in a Ratings Maintenance Phase (RAMP) with the National Computer
    Security Center (NCSC) to obtain C2 and B1 security ratings for Ver-
    sion 6.1 of OpenVMS and SEVMS, respectively, on both Alpha and VAX plat-
    forms. Digital expects to achieve C2 and B1 ratings for OpenVMS VAX
    V6.1 and SEVMS VAX V6.1 in mid 1995. Digital completed the NCSC Fu-
    ture Change Review Board (FCRB) process, presenting its plans for RAMP-
    ing to Version 6.1 of OpenVMS and SEVMS on the Alpha platform. The en-
    tire RAMP process should be completed in the Fall of 1995. Digital plans
    to continue to maintain C2 and B1 ratings on future versions of the
    OpenVMS and SEVMS operating systems.
   
    The ratings represent NCSC validation of the design of OpenVMS and SEVMS
    operating systems against DoD 5200.28-STD "Department of Defense Trusted
    Computer System Evaluation Criteria". To obtain an in-depth, 230-page
    report on the security of these systems, contact the NCSC at (410)859-
    4452 and ask for a copy of the "Final Evaluation Report Digital Equip-
    ment Corporation OpenVMS VAX and SEVMS VAX Version 6.0," CSC-EPL-93

      OpenVMS Operating System for VAX and Alpha, Version 6.2  25.01.45
   
   
      For OpenVMS V6.2 security API's for Intrusion detection, Proxy access
      and Impersonation services have been added on both the Alpha and VAX
      platform to allow for better security in your Client/Server applica-
      tions.
   
    OpenVMS provides a rich set of mechanisms to control user access to
    system-controlled data structures and devices that store information.
    OpenVMS employs a Reference Monitor concept that enforces the system
    security policy by mediating all access attempts between subjects, such
    as user processes, and security-relevant system objects, such as files.
    OpenVMS also provides a system security audit log file that option-
    ally records the results of all object access attempts. The audit log
    can also be used to capture information regarding a wide variety of
    other security-relevant events.
   
    User account information is maintained by the system manager in the
    system user authorization file (SYSUAF). When creating user accounts
    with the Authorize utility, the system manager assigns the privileges
    and quotas associated with each user account. The system manager also
    assigns a user name, password, and unique user identification code (UIC)
    to each account. Optionally, additional identifiers can be assigned
    to each account, permitting users to belong to multiple overlapping
    groups or projects. Account use may be limited by time of day, day of
    week, and type of access (such as local, remote, network, or batch).
   
    To log in and gain access to the system, the user must supply a valid
    user name and password. The password is encoded and does not appear
    on terminal displays. Users can change their password voluntarily, or
    the system manager can selectively enforce how frequently passwords
    change, along with minimum password length, or optional use of ran-
    domly generated passwords.
   
    Additionally, OpenVMS provides a password dictionary filter that screens
    password choices for common words, and a user password history fil-
    ter that prevents users from reusing passwords that they have used 
    within the last year. In addition to these built-in filters, a site 
    can design and install its own filter to screen passwords against a 
    site-specific password policy.

      OpenVMS Operating System for VAX and Alpha, Version 6.2  25.01.45
   
   
      The system password hash algorithm can also be replaced with a pri-
      vate algorithm for those sites that have contractual obligations to
      use specific public or private password encryption algorithms. This
      feature can be enabled on a per-user, per-password basis.
   
    Login security includes break-in detection, which allows terminals to
    be disabled when password guessing is detected, and a secure login path,
    which can be used to thwart Trojan horse attacks against local ter-
    minals. Additionally, a system password may be associated with dial-
    in terminal lines to prevent the display of any operating system spe-
    cific identification that might yield clues to possible attack method-
    ologies. When a user logs in, the system also displays a message stat-
    ing when the last login for the account occurred and the number of 
    failed attempts to log in since the last successful login.
   
    Every security-relevant system object is labeled with the UIC of its
    owner (normally the user who created the object) along with a simple
    protection mask. The owner UIC consists of two fields, the user field
    and a group field. System objects also have associated with them a pro-
    tection mask that allows read, write, execute, and delete access to
    be selectively granted to the object's owner, group, privileged sys-
    tem users, to all other users. In addition, system objects can be pro-
    tected with access control lists to allow access to be selectively 
    granted or denied to a list of individual users, groups, or 
    identifiers. Access control lists can also be used to audit access 
    attempts to critical system objects.
   
      OpenVMS applies full protection to the following system objects:
   
      o  Capabilities (VAX only)
   
      o  Common Event Flag Clusters
   
      o  Devices
   
      o  Files
   
      o  Group Global Sections
   
      o  Logical Name Tables
   
      o  Batch/Print Queues

      OpenVMS Operating System for VAX and Alpha, Version 6.2  25.01.45
   
   
      o  Resource Domains
   
      o  Security Classes
   
      o  System Global Sections
   
      o  Volumes (ODS-2)
   
    In addition to the protection mechanisms previously described, Open-
    VMS provides a security attribute defaulting mechanism, in the form
    of security template profiles. These template profiles are referenced
    whenever a new object is created and provide a means of associating
    default security information with each system object class except files.
    Protection information for files is inherited from the previous ver-
    sion of an existing file, the parent directory, or the creating pro-
    cess' default protection.
   
    Data scavenge protection can be enabled selectively in the form of file
    high-water marking and erase on delete attributes. These attributes
    ensure that file contents cannot be read after a file has been deleted.
    The system manager can also enforce file erasure on a per-volume ba-
    sis. The disk erasure pattern can also be replaced with a private pat-
    tern for those sites that have contractual obligations to use a spe-
    cific pattern.
   
      Security auditing is provided to allow for the selective recording of
      security related events. This auditing information can be separately
      directed to security operator terminals (alarms) or to the system se-
      curity audit log file (audits). Each audit record contains the date
      and time of the event, the identity of the associated user process,
      and additional information specific to each event.
   
      OpenVMS provides security auditing for the following events:
   
      o  Login and logout
   
      o  Login failures and break-in attempts
   
      o  Object creation, access, deaccess, and deletion, selectable by use
         of privilege, type of access, and on individual objects (ACL)
   
      o  Authorization database changes

      o  Network logical link connections and terminations for DECnet-VAX,
         DECnet/OSI, DECwindows, IPC, and SYSMAN (VAX only)
   
      o  Use of identifiers as privileges
   
      o  Installed image additions, deletions, and replacements
   
      o  Volume mounts and dismounts
   
      o  Use of the Network Control Program utility (VAX only)
   
      o  Use or failed use of individual privileges
   
      o  Use of individual process control system services
   
      o  System parameter changes
   
      o  System time changes and recalibrations
   
      Note: No system can provide complete security and Digital cannot guar-
      antee system security. However, Digital continually strives to enhance
      the security capabilities of its products. Customers are strongly ad-
      vised to follow industry recognized security practices.
   
      Operating System Environment
   
      Processes and Scheduling
   
    The basic unit of execution in OpenVMS is the process. A process con-
    sists of individual address space and registers known as "context,"
    and code called an "executable image." The context identifies the pro-
    cess and describes its current state. Executable images consist of sys-
    tem programs and user programs that have been compiled and linked.
   
    The maximum number of concurrent processes is 8192 per OpenVMS Alpha
    or OpenVMS VAX system.
   
    Processes receive processor time to execute their images based on the
    priority of the process. Thirty-Two priorities are recognized on Open-
    VMS VAX and sixty-four priorities are recognized on OpenVMS Alpha: pri-
    orities 0 to 15 are for time-sharing processes and applications that
   
                                       17
  
   
   
   
   
      OpenVMS Operating System for VAX and Alpha, Version 6.2  25.01.45
   
   
    are not time critical (four is the typical default for timesharing pro-
    cesses), and priorities 16 to 32 on VAX and 16 to 63 on Alpha are for
    real-time processes.
   
    Each time an event such as an I/O interrupt occurs, the system first
    services the event and then passes control to the highest priority pro-
    cess ready to execute. The system automatically adjusts the priori-
    ties of processes whose base priority is in the range of 0 to 15 to
    favor I/O-bound and interactive processes, but the system will not ad-
    just the priority of a process in the range of 16 to 31 for VAX or 16
    to 63 for Alpha.
   
    Real-time processes can be assigned higher priorities to ensure that
    they receive processor time whenever they are ready to execute. Real-
    time processes are scheduled preemptively; that is, if a real-time pro-
    cess is ready to execute, it is given the processor immediately, un-
    less a real-time process with a higher priority is ready to execute.
   
    OpenVMS uses paging and swapping mechanisms to provide sufficient vir-
    tual memory for multiple concurrently executing processes. Also, pag-
    ing and swapping is provided for processes whose memory requirements
    exceed available physical memory. The maximum working set size is 512
    MB of memory for Alpha and VAX.
   
    Programmers can exercise control over memory management from within
    an image. An image executing in a real-time process, for example, can
    inhibit paging or swapping of critical code and data.
   
    Peripheral devices can be managed by the system or allocated by in-
    dividual processes. At least one disk must be a system disk. Other disks
    can be designated as data disks for the general use of all users log-
    ging in to the system or for a specific group of users. The system con-
    trols interactive terminals and one or more printers.
   
    Extended Physical Addressing - VAX
   
    With OpenVMS VAX Version 6.0, physical address space was extended from
    30 bits to 32 bits. The OpenVMS VAX operating system can provide 3.5
    GB of physical memory, and .5 GB of I/O and adapter space. This ca-
    pability enables large applications and workloads to access the huge

      Vector Processing - VAX
   
    A single data item, having one value, is known as a scalar value. A
    group of related scalar values, or elements, all of the same data type,
    is known as a vector.
   
    An extension to the VAX architecture defines an optional design for
    integrated vector processing that has been adopted by several VAX sys-
    tems. The VAX vector architecture includes sixteen 64-bit vector reg-
    isters (V0 through V15), each containing 64 elements; vector control
    registers; vector function units; and a set of vector instructions.
    VAX vector instructions transfer data between the vector registers and
    memory, perform integer and floating-point arithmetic, and execute pro-
    cessor control functions.
   
    A more detailed description of the VAX vector architecture, vector reg-
    isters, and vector instructions appears in the VAX MACRO and Instruc-
    tion Set Reference Manual.
   
    The OpenVMS VAX operating system provides fully shared, multiprogramming
    support for VAX vector processing systems. By default, OpenVMS VAX loads
    vector support code when initializing vector-present systems, but does
    not load it when initializing vector-absent systems. A system manager
   
                                       19
  
   
   
   
   
      OpenVMS Operating System for VAX and Alpha, Version 6.2  25.01.45
   
   
      can control this behavior by using the system parameter VECTOR_PROC,
      as described in the OpenVMS VAX documentation.
   
      The presence of vector support code in a system has little effect on
      processes running in a scalar-only system, or scalar processes run-
      ning in a vector-present system. If many processes must compete si-
      multaneously for vector processor resources in a system, the system
      manager can maintain good performance by adjusting system resources
      and process quotas as indicated in the OpenVMS VAX documentation.
   
      The OpenVMS VAX operating system makes the services of the vector pro-
      cessor available to system users by means of a software abstract known
      as a capability. A system manager can restrict the use of the vector
      processor to users holding a particular identifier by associating an
      access control list (ACL) entry with the CAPABILITY object VECTOR.
   
      The VAX Vector Instruction Emulation Facility (VVIEF) is a standard
      feature of the OpenVMS VAX operating system that allows vectorized ap-
      plications to be written and debugged in a VAX system in which vec-
      tor processors are not available. VVIEF emulates the VAX vector pro-
      cessing environment, including the nonprivileged VAX vector instruc-
      tions and the OpenVMS VAX vector system services, as described by the
      OpenVMS VAX documentation. Use of VVIEF is restricted to user mode 
      code.
   
      DECdtm Services
   
      The DECdtm services embedded in the OpenVMS operating system support
      fully distributed databases using a "two-phase commit" protocol. The
      DECdtm services provide the technology and features for distributed
      processing, ensuring both transaction and database integrity across
      multiple Digital resource managers. Updates to distributed databases
      occur as a single "all or nothing" unit of work, regardless of where
      the data physically resides. This ensures consistency of distributed
      data.
   
    DECdtm services allow applications to define "global transactions" that
    may include calls to any of a number of Digital data management prod-
    ucts. Regardless of the mix of data management products used, the global
   
   
   
                                       20
  
   
   
   
   
      OpenVMS Operating System for VAX and Alpha, Version 6.2  25.01.45
   
   
      transaction will either commit or abort. OpenVMS is unique in provid-
      ing transaction processing functionality as base operating system ser-
      vices.
   
      DECdtm features include:
   
    o  Embedded OpenVMS system services support the DECtp architecture,
       providing features and the technology for distributed transaction
       processing.
   
    o  Allows multiple disjoint resources to be updated atomically. These
       resources can be either physically disjointed (for example, on dif-
       ferent CPUs) or logically disjointed (for example, in different 
       databases on the same CPU).
   
    o  Encourages robust application development. Applications can be writ-
       ten to ensure that data is never in an inconsistent state, even in
       the event of system failures.
   
    o  Can be called using any Digital TP monitor or database product. This
       is useful for applications using several Digital database products.
   
      Interprocess Communication
   
      OpenVMS provides a number of facilities for applications that consist
      of multiple cooperating processes.
   
    o  Mailboxes are virtual devices that allow processes to communicate
       with queued messages.
   
    o  Shared memory sections on a single processor or a symmetrical mul-
       tiprocessing (SMP) system permit multiple processes to access shared
       address space concurrently.
   
    o  Common event flags provide simple synchronization.
   
    o  The lock manager provides a more comprehensive enqueue/dequeue fa-
       cility with multilevel locks, values, and ASTs (asynchronous sys-
       tem traps).
   
      Symmetric Multiprocessing

      OpenVMS Operating System for VAX and Alpha, Version 6.2  25.01.45
   
   
    OpenVMS provides symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) support for Alpha and
    VAX multiprocessor systems. SMP is a form of tightly coupled multi-
    processing in which all processors perform operations simultaneously.
    The processors can perform operations in all OpenVMS access modes (user,
    supervisor, executive, and kernel).
   
    OpenVMS SMP configurations consist of multiple central processing units
    executing code from a single shared memory address space. Users and
    processes share a single copy of OpenVMS Alpha or OpenVMS VAX. SMP also
    provides simultaneous shared access to common data in global sections
    to all processors. OpenVMS SMP dynamically selects the CPU where a pro-
    cess will run based on process priority.
   
    SMP support is an integral part of OpenVMS and is provided transpar-
    ently to the user. Because an SMP system is a single system entity,
    it is configured into a network and VMScluster configurations as a sin-
    gle node.
   
    Networking Facilities
   
    OpenVMS provides device drivers for all Digital LAN adapters listed
    in the LAN Options section of Appendix A of this SPD. Application pro-
    grammers can use the QIO system service to communicate with other sys-
    tems connected via the LAN using either Ethernet or IEEE 802.3 packet
    format. Simultaneous use of Digital Ethernet and IEEE 802.3 protocols
    are supported on any Digital LAN adapter.
   
    DECnet/OSI offers task-to-task communications, file management, down-
    line system and task loading, network command terminals, and network
    resource sharing capabilities as defined in the Digital Network Ar-
    chitecture (DNA) Phase V protocols. DECnet/OSI provides the newest DEC-
    net features such as Extended Addressing, and downline load perfor-
    mance enhancements. DECnet/OSI integrates DECnet and OSI protocols and
    now provides a linkage to TCP/IP using RFC 1006 and RFC 1006+. DEC-
    net and OSI applications can now be run over DECnet (NSP), OSI (CLNS),
    and/or TCP/IP transports.

      ities as defined in the Digital Network Architecture (DNA) Phase IV.

      ASSOCIATED PRODUCTS section of this SPD.
   
      Terminal Server Products
   
      Digital's terminal server products can be used for terminal server ac-
      cess to OpenVMS. When used in a VMScluster system environment, ter-
      minal servers automatically distribute users at login time across the
      available Alpha and VAX systems.
   
      OpenVMS can also establish a connection to other devices (such as 
      printers) attached to such terminal servers.
   
      Reliability
   
      The system handles hardware errors as transparently as possible while
      maintaining data integrity and providing sufficient information to di-
      agnose the cause of the error. The system limits the effects of an er-
      ror by first determining if the error is fatal. If the error occurs
      in system context, then the current OpenVMS system is shut down. If
      the error is not fatal, then recovery actions pertinent to the error
      are executed and the current operation is continued.
   
      In all cases, information relevant to the error is collected and put
      in the error log file for later analysis. Hardware errors include the
      following categories:
   
      o  Processor errors. These include processor soft errors, processor
         hard errors, processor machine checks, and adapter errors.
   
      o  Memory errors. These can be unrecoverable (hard) errors or recov-
         erable (soft) errors. The system examines memory at startup time
         and does not use any pages found to be bad. During system opera-
         tion, the system transparently corrects all single-bit memory er-
         rors for those systems with Error Correction Code (ECC) memory. On
         OpenVMS VAX, an unrecoverable error causes the memory page on which
         the error occurred to be added to the bad page list. If the page
         has not been modified, system operation continues with a new copy
         of the page.
   
                                       23
  
   
   
   
   
      OpenVMS Operating System for VAX and Alpha, Version 6.2  25.01.45
   
   
    o  Correctable memory errors. A primary cause of these correctable mem-
       ory errors is Alpha particle radiation. On some processors, when
       correctable memory errors occur, the memory controller corrects only
       the data returned to the CPU or I/O controller. The actual data in
       memory is left with the error intact. Subsequent read operations
       will cause correction cycles to occur and in most cases an inter-
       rupt to report the error. On many of these processors, OpenVMS mon-
       itors the occurrence of correctable memory errors and in almost all
       cases is able to remove the error condition by rewriting the data
       in memory. Rewriting the data causes the data to be corrected in
       the memory location. On OpenVMS VAX, if the cause of the error is
       not transient, and the error condition persists, the operating sys-
       tem will attempt to move the data from the existing page which con-
       tains the error to a new page. The original page is then retired
       from use.
   
      Other failures include:
   
      o  Operating system errors (system-detected inconsistencies or archi-
         tectural errors in system context)
   
      o  User errors
   
      o  I/O errors
   
    The system logs all processor errors, all operating system errors de-
    tected through internal consistency checks, all double-bit memory er-
    rors (and a summary of corrected single-bit memory errors), and most
    I/O errors.
   
    If the system is shut down because of an unrecoverable hardware or soft-
    ware error, a dump of physical memory is written. The dump includes
    the contents of the processor registers. The OpenVMS System Dump An-
    alyzer utility is provided for analyzing memory dumps.
   
      Power Failures - VAX

      OpenVMS Operating System for VAX and Alpha, Version 6.2  25.01.45
   
   
    If power fails, the system shuts down automatically. When power is re-
    stored, the system restarts automatically and resumes processing at
    the point of interruption if the system has a time-of-day clock and
    a memory battery backup unit, if the contents of memory are still valid,
    and if the system is set to permit automatic rebooting.
   
    The system restarts devices and communications lines. All I/O oper-
    ations in progress, including magnetic tape I/O operations, are 
    restarted. On request, programs can be notified of power restoration. 
    An optional battery-operated hardware clock resets the date and time 
    of day when the system restarts. If the system does not have a 
    battery backup unit, or if the memory contents are not valid on power 
    restoration, the system will reboot automatically if the system is 
    set to permit automatic rebooting.
   
    If, for any reason, after a power failure the system disk does not come
    back on line within a specific time after the CPU regains power, the
    system shuts down.
   
    Input/Output
   
    The QIO system service provides a direct interface to the operating
    system's I/O routines. These services are available from within most
    OpenVMS programming languages and can be used to perform low-level I/O
    operations efficiently with a minimal amount of system overhead for
    time-critical applications.
   
    Device drivers execute I/O instructions to transfer data to and from
    a device and to communicate directly with an I/O device. Each type of
    I/O device requires its own driver. Digital supplies drivers for all
    devices supported by the OpenVMS operating system and provides QIO sys-
    tem service routines to access the special device-dependent features
    available in many of these devices.
   
    OpenVMS supports a variety of disk and tape peripheral devices, as well
    as terminals, networks, and mailboxes (virtual devices for interpro-
    cess communication), and more general I/O devices.

      OpenVMS Operating System for VAX and Alpha, Version 6.2  25.01.45
   
   
    On OpenVMS Alpha, users can write device drivers for I/O devices for
    which the operating system does not provide drivers. OpenVMS Alpha Ver-
    sion 6.2 supports the Step 2 device driver interface, which allows de-
    vice drivers to be written in DEC C and MACRO-32. OpenVMS Alpha doc-
    umentation is available that describes how to write OpenVMS Alpha de-
    vice drivers and how to convert existing OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Al-
    pha Step 1 device drivers to OpenVMS Alpha Step 2 device drivers. The
    DEC C compiler for OpenVMS Alpha is an optional orderable layered prod-
    uct.
   
    On OpenVMS VAX, users can write their own device drivers in MACRO-32
    for I/O devices for which the operating system does not provide drivers.
    The OpenVMS VAX Device Support Manual and the OpenVMS VAX Device Sup-
    port Reference Manual in the OpenVMS Full Documentation Set describe
    how to write device drivers.
   
    Record Management Services (RMS)
   
    Record Management Services (RMS) is a set of I/O services that helps
    application programs to process and manage files and records. Although
    it is primarily intended to provide a comprehensive software inter-
    face to mass storage devices, RMS also supports device-independent ac-
    cess to unit-record devices.
   
    RMS supports sequential, relative, and indexed file organizations in
    fixed-length and variable-length record formats. RMS also supports byte
    stream formats for sequential file organization.
   
    RMS record access modes provide access to records in four ways: se-
    quentially, directly by key value, directly by relative record num-
    ber, and directly by record file address. RMS also supports block I/O
    operations for various performance-critical applications that may re-
    quire user-defined file organizations and record formats.
   
    RMS promotes safe and efficient file sharing by providing multiple file
    access modes, automatic record locking where applicable, and optional
    buffer sharing by multiple processes.
   
   
                                       26
  
   
   
   
   
      OpenVMS Operating System for VAX and Alpha, Version 6.2  25.01.45
   
   
      RMS utilities aid file creation and record maintenance. These util-
      ities convert files from one organization and format to another, re-
      structure indexed files for storage and access efficiency, and reclaim
      data structures within indexed files. The utilities also generate ap-
      propriate reports.
   
    For systems that have DECnet-VAX, DECnet for OpenVMS Alpha or DECnet/OSI
    installed, RMS provides a subset of file and record management ser-
    vices to remote network nodes. Network remote file operations are gen-
    erally transparent to user programs.
   
    DCL commands such as EDIT, CREATE, COPY, TYPE, and PRINT allow manip-
    ulation of RMS files and records within RMS files at the DCL command
    level.
   
    Virtual I/O Cache
   
    OpenVMS provides a standalone or clusterwide, file-oriented disk cache.
    Applications automatically benefit from the advantages of the virtual
    I/O cache without any special coding. The virtual I/O cache file-caching
    algorithm is dynamically chosen based on the type of clusterwide ac-
    cess currently in progress. Virtual I/O caching reduces current and
    potential I/O bottlenecks within OpenVMS systems. It reduces the num-
    ber of I/Os to the disk subsystem, thereby reducing a systemwide bot-
    tleneck.
   
    Disk and Tape Volumes
   
    Disk volumes can be organized into volume sets. Volume sets can con-
    tain a mix of disk device types and can be extended by adding volumes.
    Within a volume set, files of any organization type can span multi-
    ple volumes. Files can be allocated to the set as a whole (the default)
    or to specific volumes within the set. Optionally, portions of indexed
    files can be allocated to specific areas of a single disk volume or
    to specific volumes in a volume set.
   
    Disk quotas can be placed to control the amount of space individual
    users can allocate. Quota assignment is made by user identification
    code and can be controlled for each individual volume set in the sys-
    tem (or for each individual volume if the volume is not part of a set).
   
                                       27
  
   
   
   
   
      OpenVMS Operating System for VAX and Alpha, Version 6.2  25.01.45
   
   
      Disk structure information can be cached in memory to reduce the I/O
      overhead required for file management services. Although not required
      to do so, users can preallocate space and control automatic alloca-
      tion. For example, a file can be extended by a given number of blocks,
      contiguously or noncontiguously, for optimal file system performance
      in specific cases.
   
    The system applies software validity checks and checksums to criti-
    cal disk structure information. If a disk is improperly dismounted be-
    cause of user error or system failure, the system automatically re-
    builds the disk's structure information the next time the disk is mounted.
    The system detects bad blocks dynamically and prevents their reuse once
    the files to which the blocks were allocated are deleted. On DIGITAL
    Storage Architecture (DSA) disks, the disk controller dynamically de-
    tects and replaces bad blocks automatically.
   
     The system provides eight levels of named directories and subdirec-
    tories whose contents are alphabetically ordered. Device and file spec-
    ifications follow Digital conventions. Logical names can be used to
    abbreviate the specifications and to make application programs device
    and file name independent. A logical name can be assigned to an en-
    tire specification, to a portion of a specification, or to another log-
    ical name.
   
    OpenVMS supports multivolume magnetic tape files with transparent vol-
    ume switching. Access positioning is done either by file name or by
    relative file position.
   
    Monitoring Performance History Software (MPH)
   
    Monitoring performance History (MPH) software is distributed with the
    OpenVMS distribution kit and is installed seperately. MPH is a tool
    which collects error logs, crash dump summaries and configuration data
    from the system on which it is installed. This data is transmitted back
    to Digital and is used to set standard requirements for future releases
    of OpenVMS, such as Mean Time Between Crash (MTBCr) and Mean Time Be-
    tween System Interruption (MTBSi). The disk space requirement for MPH
    installation is approximately 1200 blocks. MPH requires 300 blocks of

      ASSOCIATED PRODUCTS
   
    OpenVMS Cluster Software
   
    OpenVMS Cluster Software is available for Alpha and VAX systems as a
    separately licensed System Integrated Product. It provides a highly
    integrated OpenVMS computing environment distributed over multiple sys-
    tems. This environment is called a VMScluster system and may contain
    up to 96 nodes.
   
    VMScluster systems communicate using any combination of the follow-
    ing interconnects; CI, DSSI, FDDI, Ethernet, and SCSI. Additionally,
    when configured with suitable FDDI bridges, VMScluster configurations
    may utilize DS3/T3 and ATM networking infrastructures.
   
    Applications running on one or more nodes in a VMScluster system ac-
    cess shared resources in a coordinated manner. VMScluster software com-
    ponents synchronize access to shared resources, preventing multiple
    processes on any node in the VMScluster from interfering with each other
    when updating data. This coordination ensures data integrity during
    multiple concurrent update transactions. Application programs can spec-
    ify the level of VMScluster file sharing that is required; access is
    then coordinated by the OpenVMS Extended QIO Processor (XQP) and Record
    Management Services (RMS).
   
    The OpenVMS queue manager controls VMScluster batch and print queues,
    which can be accessed by any VMScluster node. Batch jobs submitted to
    VMScluster queues are routed to any available CPU so that the batch
    load is shared.
   
    The Lock Manager provides synchronized services between systems in a
    cluster, for use both by system components such as RMS and XQP, and
    also for direct use by applications.

   Two or more Alpha and VAX computers connected to the same Computer In-
   terconnect (CI), DIGITAL Storage Systems Interconnect (DSSI), or Small
   Computer Systems Interconnect (SCSI) must be configured as members of
   the same VMScluster system.
   
   Mixed-architecture and mixed-version clusters containing both Alpha
   systems and VAX systems are supported.
   
   VMScluster systems provide a uniform computing environment that is highly
   scalable, highly available, and secure. OpenVMS Cluster Software im-
   plements a single security environment within a cluster configuration.
   The security subsystem ensures that all cluster-visible objects main-
   tain consistent security profiles and that system security auditing
   controls operate clusterwide.

      OpenVMS Operating System for VAX and Alpha, Version 6.2  25.01.45
   
   
      Digital provides the Volume Shadowing for OpenVMS Alpha and VAX prod-
      ucts for performing disk mirroring operations, using a RAID 1 stor-
      age strategy implementation. In this description, every use of Vol-
      ume Shadowing for OpenVMS means both the Volume Shadowing for Open-
      VMS Alpha product and the Volume Shadowing for OpenVMS VAX product.
   
    Volume Shadowing for OpenVMS is a System Integrated Product (SIP) that
    is separately licensed. Volume Shadowing for OpenVMS provides high data
    availability for disk devices by ensuring against data loss result-
    ing from media deterioration or controller or device failure. This pre-
    vents storage subsystem component failures from interrupting system
    or application operations.
   
    The system disk and Files-11 On-Disk Structure 2 (ODS2) data disks can
    be volume shadowed.
   
    The Volume Shadowing for OpenVMS product supports shadowing of all MSCP
    compliant DSA disks and all Digital SCSI disks. All disks in a sin-
    gle shadow set must have the same number of logical blocks and the same
    physical geometry. Shadow set members can be located on a single sys-
    tem or anywhere in a VMScluster system. Disks can be configured on any
    MSCP or Digital SCSI compliant controller.
   
    Volume Shadowing for OpenVMS provides fault tolerance resulting from
    disk media errors or controller errors across the full range of Al-
    pha and VAX processors and configurations. Shadow set member units can
    be located on different controllers and OpenVMS Alpha and VAX MSCP servers,
    providing configuration flexibility and a high degree of data avail-
    ability.
   
    Volume Shadowing for OpenVMS supports an unlimited number of single
    member shadow sets and up to 400 disks in multi-member (2 or 3 mem-
    ber) shadow sets on a standalone or VMScluster system.
   
    Phase I of Volume Shadowing (also known as Controller-Based Shadow-
    ing) which was available in the past on OpenVMS VAX, is no longer sup-
    ported.

    RMS Journaling for OpenVMS
   
    Digital provides the RMS Journaling for OpenVMS Alpha and VAX prod-
    ucts as separately licensed System Integrated Products (SIPs) that en-
    able a system manager, user, or application to maintain the data in-
    tegrity of RMS files in the event of a number of failure scenarios.
    These products protect RMS file data from becoming lost or inconsis-
    tent.

      OpenVMS Operating System for VAX and Alpha, Version 6.2  25.01.45
   
   
    RMS Journaling provides the following three types of journaling:
   
    o  After-image journaling. Provides the ability to "redo" modifica-
       tions that have been made to a file. This type of journaling al-
       lows users to recover files that are inadvertently deleted, lost,
       or corrupted. RMS Journaling recovers the file by applying the jour-
       naled modifications to a backup copy, thereby restoring its final
       state. No application modifications are necessary in order to use
       after-image journaling.
   
    o  Before-image journaling. Provides the ability to "undo" modifica-
       tions that have been made to a file. This type of journaling pro-
       vides the ability to return a file to a previous known state. This
       is useful in the event that a file is updated with erroneous or bad
       data. No application modifications are necessary in order to use
       before-image journaling.
   
    o  Recovery unit journaling. Provides the ability to maintain trans-
       action integrity. A transaction may be defined as a series of many
       file updates, on one or more files. In the event of any failure dur-
       ing the transaction, recovery unit journaling will roll back the
       partially completed transaction to its starting point. This allows
       complex transactions to be completed as an atomic event-partially
       completed transactions can be avoided. Recovery unit journaling re-
       quires application modification.
   
    The binary kit for RMS Journaling ships with the OpenVMS Alpha and VAX
    distribution kits. To run the software, customers need to purchase a
    license and documentation. Refer to the RMS Journaling for OpenVMS Soft-
    ware Product Description (SPD 47.03.xx) for more information.
   
    DECram for OpenVMS
   
    DECram for OpenVMS, a separately orderable layered product, is a disk
    device driver that lets a system manager create pseudo disks (RAMdisks)
    that reside in main memory for the purpose of improving I/O perfor-
    mance. Frequently accessed data can be accessed much faster from a 
    DECram device than from a physical disk device. These RAMdisks can be
    accessed through the file system just as physical disks are accessed,
    requiring no change to application or system software.

      OpenVMS Operating System for VAX and Alpha, Version 6.2  25.01.45
   
   
      Since main memory is allocated for the DECram device, an amount of ex-
      tra memory is generally required. The amount of memory dedicated is
      selectable. The system manager designates the amount of memory ded-
      icated to the DECram device(s) and the files that will be stored on
      it. The maximum size of a DECram device is 524,280 blocks. Refer to
      the DECram for OpenVMS Software Product Description (SPD 34.26.xx) for
      more information.
   
      DECwindows Motif[R] for OpenVMS
   
      Digital offers a separately orderable layered product called DECwin-
      dows Motif for OpenVMS, which provides support for both OSF/Motif[R],
      a standards-based graphical user interface, and the X user interface
      (XUI) in a single run-time and development environment. By default,
      DECwindows Motif displays the OSF/Motif user interface. Because both
      Motif and XUI are based on MIT's X Window System, applications writ-
      ten to either toolkit will run regardless of which environment the user
      selects. Refer to the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS Software Product
      Description (SPD 42.19.xx) for more information.
   
      The OpenVMS software installation procedure contains an optional step
      to allow installation of the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS workstation
      and font support, which is required to run the DECwindows Motif for

    The X Window System Display PostScript has two components:
   
    o  Display PostScript server extension, which is provided with the dis-
       play server in the OpenVMS Alpha and OpenVMS VAX operating systems.
       A workstation is required to use this server.
   
    o  Adobe[R] client libraries, which are used by applications to per-
       form PostScript operations, such as rotating and scaling fonts, gen-
       erating curves, and displaying PostScript documents. The Adobe client
       libraries are available in the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS lay-
       ered product, as well as on third-party platforms, including IBM[R],
       Sun[R], and Silicon Graphics.
   
    X Display PostScript adds the following capabilities to the basic X11
    Window System environment:
   
      o  All DECwindows fonts can be displayed at any size and rotation an-
         gle.
   
      o  Display PostScript graphics are specified in a user-defined coor-
         dinate system independent of monitor density.
   
      o  Color or gray-scale rendition is automatically modified to take ad-
         vantage of the monitor type through either direct display, color
         dithering, or half-toning.
   
      o  Display PostScript display routines can be downloaded to the server
         and executed on command.
   
      o  Sophisticated graphics primitives, such as precisely controlled 
         Bezier curves, can be displayed.
   
      o  Any display can be scaled and rotated arbitrarily.
   
      The Display PostScript system also allows users to view PostScript 
      files with such applications as DECwindows Mail and the CDA Viewer 
      without generating hard copy. (Terms and Conditions for Display 
      PostScript can be found in the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS Software 
      Product Description (SPD 42.19.xx).

      CONFORMANCE TO STANDARDS
   
      OpenVMS is based on the following public, national, and international
      standards:
   
      POSIX Support
   
      OpenVMS supports a large number of industry standards, facilitating
      application portability and interoperability. This standards support
      includes POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface). POSIX defines
      a set of interface standards for various parts of an operating sys-
      tem. The POSIX standards have been generated by the Institute of Elec-
      trical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and are supported by organi-
      zations such as the International Organization for Standardization 
      (ISO).
   
      The OpenVMS environment with POSIX for OpenVMS and DEC C installed in-
      cludes standards support for the system application programming in-
      terface (POSIX 1003.1), shell and utilities (1003.2), and real-time
      programming (1003.1b, ex 1003.4 draft).
   
      The OpenVMS environment, in conjunction with POSIX for OpenVMS Ver-
      sion 2.0 and DEC C, has been certified by the National Institute of
      Standards and Technology (NIST) as conforming to the Federal Infor-
      mation Processing Standard (FIPS 151-2).
   
      XPG4 BASE Profile Branding
   
      The OpenVMS environment, with POSIX for OpenVMS Version 2.0 and DEC
      C installed, extends the support for POSIX standards to include the
      X/Open BASE specifications defined in the X/Open Portability Guide,
      Issue 4 (XPG4). The XPG4 BASE specifications extend the system appli-
      cation programming interface and shell and utilities offered in the
      IEEE POSIX standards. XPG4 also includes standards-based internation-
      alization support.
   
      The OpenVMS environment, with POSIX for OpenVMS Version 2.0 and DEC
      C installed was awarded the X/Open XPG4 BASE Profile Brand.

      OpenVMS Operating System for VAX and Alpha, Version 6.2  25.01.45
   
   
    Platforms and components that successfully complete the branding pro-
    cess and pass X/Open Verification Test Suite for XPG4 (VSX4) are awarded
    the X/Open XPG4 BASE Profile Brand. Components must pass a series of
    more than 11500 tests in VSX4 to earn the X/Open BASE Profile Brand.
    These tests ensure that the OpenVMS environment with POSIX for Open-
    VMS Version 2.0 and DEC C installed supports the essential set of in-
    terfaces necessary in an open system.
   
    The inclusion of XPG4 BASE support in the OpenVMS environment gives
    application developers a broader set of standards-based portability
    features to incorporate into their applications. Most applications that
    strictly conform to the POSIX and XPG4 specifications can be devel-
    oped on an OpenVMS system with POSIX for OpenVMS and the DEC C com-
    piler, and then ported without modification to any other platform that
    also supports the same POSIX standards and XPG4 specifications.
   
      Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) Support
   
      The Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) for the OpenVMS product
      family provides a set of the distributed computing features specified
      by the Open Software Foundation's (OSF) Distributed Computing Envi-
      ronment, as well as tools for application developers. With DCE, the
      OSF has established a standard set of services and interfaces that fa-
      cilitate the creation, use, and maintenance of client/server appli-
      cations. The DCE for OpenVMS serves as the basis for an open comput-
      ing environment where networks of multivendor systems appear as a sin-
      gle system to the user. Because DCE makes the underlying networks and
      operating systems transparent, application developers can easily build
      portable, interoperable client/server applications. Users can locate
      and share information safely and easily across the entire enterprise.
      The DCE for OpenVMS supplies system managers with a set of tools to
      consistently manage the entire distributed computing environment while
      assuring the integrity of the enterprise.
   
      The DCE for OpenVMS product family currently consists of the follow-
      ing products.

      o  DCE Runtime Services for OpenVMS, which is required for all sys-
         tems participating in the DCE cell. The DCE Runtime Services in-
         cludes DCE client functions as well as DCE administration tools.
         The DCE Runtime Services provides client/server applications the
         ability to interoperate over DECnet, TCP/IP, and UDP/IP network 
         protocols.
   
      o  DCE Application Developers' Kits for OpenVMS, which is required for
         developers of distributed applications but is optional for other
         users. The DCE Application Developers' Kit provides programmers 
         with an Interface Definition Language (IDL), an easy-to-use, ANSI 
         C-based language for writing remote procedure calls.
   
      o  DCE Cell Directory Server (CDS), one of which is required for each
         DCE cell. The DCE CDS is a central repository containing informa-
         tion about the location of resources in the DCE cell. It allows ac-
         cess to resources by a single name, regardless of physical loca-
         tion.
   
      o  Digital DCE Security Server, one of which is required for each DCE.
         The DCE Security Server protects resources from illegal access and
         provides secure communications within and between DCE cells.
   
      The right-to-use the DCE Runtime Services is bundled with the Open-
      VMS operating system base license. All other DCE products are avail-
      able as separate layered products. Refer to the Digital Distributed
      Computing Environment (DCE) for OpenVMS Software Product Description
      (SPD 43.05.xx) for more detailed information.
   
      Support for OSF/Motif and X Window System Standards
   
      DECwindows Motif provides support for OSF/Motif, a standards-based 
      graphical user interface, and the X Consortium's X Window System, 
      Version 11, Release 5 (X11R5) server.

    INSTALLATION
   
    OpenVMS Alpha is distributed as a binary kit on CD-ROM. Procedures for
    setting up the system disk from media and for preparing the system for
    day-to-day operations are provided. The procedures use POLYCENTER Soft-
    ware Installation utility to configure and install the OpenVMS Alpha
    Version 6.2 operating system. These procedures are described in the
    OpenVMS Alpha Version 6.2 Upgrade and Installation Manual and cover
    letter.
   
    OpenVMS VAX is distributed as binary kits on CD-ROM and tape. Proce-
    dures for setting up the system disk from a kit and for preparing the
    system for day-to-day operations are easy and straightforward. The pro-
    cedures are described in the OpenVMS VAX Version 6.2 Upgrade and In-
    stallation Manual. Computer-specific information is contained in the
    upgrade and installation supplements for each family of VAX comput-
    ers.
   
    POLYCENTER Software Installation
   
    The POLYCENTER Software Installation utility is now included in Open-
    VMS. The POLYCENTER Software Installation utility is distributed with
    the OpenVMS Version 6.2 distribution kit, and the right to use the POLY-
    CENTER software is bundled with the OpenVMS operating system base li-
    cense. The POLYCENTER Software Installation utility is a new technol-
    ogy that simplifies the installation and management of OpenVMS prod-
    ucts.
   
    For system managers, the POLYCENTER Software Installation utility pro-
    vides DIGITAL Command Language (DCL) and DECwindows Motif interfaces
    which can be used to install, configure, reconfigure, and deinstall
    software products that have been prepared with the POLYCENTER Soft-
    ware Installation utility. In addition, the POLYCENTER software pro-
    vides a database to track the installation, reconfiguration, and de-
    installation of software. For products installed with other instal-
    lation technologies, the POLYCENTER Software Installation utility pro-
    vides a mechanism for adding information about them to the POLYCEN-
    TER database. The POLYCENTER Software Installation utility also pro-
   
   
                                       42
  
   
   
   
   
      OpenVMS Operating System for VAX and Alpha, Version 6.2  25.01.45
   
   
    vides the ability to manage dependencies between products during the
    installation process.
   
    For software providers, the POLYCENTER software simplifies the task
    of packaging software by providing a simple, declarative language for
    describing material for the installation kit and defining how it is
    installed. The POLYCENTER Software Installation utility handles the
    functions; the developer instructs the utility what to do. This sig-
    nificantly reduces the complexity and time to develop installation pro-
    cedures. The language allows the developer to easily specify depen-
    dencies on other software, manage certain "objects" in the execution
    environment (such as files and directories), and anticipate and re-
    solve conflict before it occurs. The POLYCENTER software also signif-
    icantly simplifies the packaging of multiple software products into
    one logical product.
   
    VMSINSTAL
   
    OpenVMS VAX includes the VMSINSTAL facility to automate operating sys-
    tem software updates, as well as to handle the installation of optional
    Digital-supplied software products. OpenVMS Alpha includes the VMSIN-
    STAL facility to handle the installation of optional Digital-supplied
    software products that have not converted to PCSI.
   
    Test Package and Diagnostics
   
    OpenVMS includes a User Environment Test Package (UETP), which ver-
    ifies that the OpenVMS operating system is properly installed and ready
    for use on the customer's systems.
   
    Diagnostics can be run on individual devices during normal system op-
    eration. Certain critical components can operate in degraded mode.

      The Minimum OpenVMS Files listed above are for a system configuration
      where all optional features have been declined during the initial in-
      stallation. For most applications, this is not a realistic OpenVMS en-
      vironment.
   
      The Paging, Swap, and Dump file requirements above are the minimum for
      a system with 32 MB of main memory. Additional memory in most cases
      will add to the space needed for these files, as will particular needs
      of your application. With careful system management it is possible to
      use Paging file space as a temporary dump file.

      OpenVMS Operating System for VAX and Alpha, Version 6.2  25.01.45
   
   
      For a VMScluster system disk, Paging, Swap, and Dump files cannot be
      shared between nodes so the files must either be duplicated on the 
      system disk or located on some other disk.
   
      DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS Alpha Disk Block Requirements
   
      To support OpenVMS Alpha and the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS Alpha,
      a system disk of greater than 380 MB is recommended, however, a sub-
      set of DECwindows Motif can be installed. The disk space required for
      the installation of DECwindows Motif is 64 MB. The permancent amount
      of space used is 62 MB. An additional 33 MB is needed to install the
      DECwindow X11 Display Server and associated files. (These DECwindow
      X11 Display Server and associated files are included in the OpenVMS
      Alpha Version 6.2 media.) These disk space requirements are in addi-
      tion the disk space required for the OpenVMS Alpha V6.2 operating sys-
      tem as indicated in the OpenVMS Alpha DISK SPACE REQUIREMENTS table.
   
      Installation of the DECwindows Motif Version 1.2-3 layered product 
      gives customers the option of installing any or all of the following 
      components:
   
      o  User environment and applications - 34 MB. This section provides
         support for running DECwindows Motif applications on VAX compute
         servers.
   
      o  Programming support - 7 MB. This section includes support for the
         DEC C, DEC C++, DEC Fortran, Pascal, and VAX C programming 
         languages. If a subset of languages is installed, the amount of 
         disk space required will be less.
   
      o  Example files - approximately 7 MB.
   
      o  Translated Image Support - approximately 17 MB.
   
    Layered Product Disk Space Requirements
   
    In addition to the disk space used directly by Digital or third-party
    layered products (as specified in documentation for those products),
    there may be additional space used to store information from those prod-
    ucts in OpenVMS Help Libraries, Command Tables, Object Libraries and
    elsewhere. The exact amount of additional disk space required cannot
   
                                       45
  
   
   
   
   
      OpenVMS Operating System for VAX and Alpha, Version 6.2  25.01.45
   
   
      be totally predicted due to the possibility of recovering unused space
      already existing in those library files. Unusually large modules con-
      tributed by layered products can also affect the amount of space re-
      quired for upgrading to a new version of the OpenVMS Alpha operating
      system.
   
   
    OpenVMS VAX DISK SPACE REQUIREMENTS
   
    Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 3)
   
    To support the complete OpenVMS VAX operating system environment, a
    system disk of greater than 100 MB is recommended. When a smaller disk
    is used, additional tailoring is required prior to installing some 
    OpenVMS VAX options. This does not include the dump file space. Refer 
    to the OpenVMS VAX Version 6.2 Upgrade and Installation Manual for 
    information on tailoring.

      memory and disk.
   
   DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS VAX Disk Block Requirements
   
   To support OpenVMS VAX and the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS VAX lay-
   ered product, a system disk of greater than 175 MB is recommended. The
   disk space required for the installation of DECwindows Motif is 39 MB.
   The permanent amount of space used is 34 MB. An additional 16 MB are
   needed to install the DECwindows X11 Display Server and associated files.
   (These DECwindows X11 Display Server and associated files are included
   in the OpenVMS VAX Version 6.2 media.) These disk space requirements
   are in addition to the 78 MB required for the other components of the
   
                                       47

    sion 6.2 Upgrade and Installation Manual for details on tailoring small
    system disks in order to support the DECwindows Motif environment.
   
    Installation of the DECwindows Motif Version 1.2-3 layered product gives
    customers the option of installing any or all of the following com-
    ponents:
   
    o  User environment and applications - 22 MB. This section provides
       support for running DECwindows Motif applications on VAX compute
       servers.
   
    o  Programming support - 6 MB. This section includes support for the
       DEC C, DEC C++, DEC Fortran, Pascal, and VAX C programming languages.
       If a subset of languages is installed, the amount of disk space re-
       quired will be less.
   
    o  Example files - approximately 6 MB.
   
    Note that the individual sizes add up to more than the total because
    some components are shared by multiple portions of the environment.
   
     MEMORY SPACE REQUIREMENTS
   
      OpenVMS Alpha Memory Space Requirements
   
      The minimum amount of memory required to install, boot, and log in to
      an OpenVMS Alpha system is 32 MB. To ensure satisfactory performance
      for particular applications or numbers of users, additional memory may
      be required. Refer to specific layered product documentation for mem-
      ory requirements.
   
      OpenVMS VAX Memory Space Requirements
   
      The minimum amount of memory supported for an OpenVMS VAX environment
      is dependent upon the specific system(s) being used and the overall
      type of configuration and application requirements. The minimum amount
      of memory supported for a standalone VAX system running OpenVMS VAX
      Version 6.2 is 4 MB. The minimum amount of memory supported for a VAX
      workstation running OpenVMS VAX Version 6.2 is 12 MB.

      o  Online books (viewed using the DECwindows Motif Bookreader)
   
      For Version 6.2, online documentation will be distributed on a sep-
      arate CD-ROM that will ship with the OpenVMS Binary CD-ROMs. Customers
      will automatically receive the entire OpenVMS documentation offering
      in Bookreader format on the Documentation CD-ROM. Viewing online doc-
      umentation in Bookreader requires that DECwindows Motif be installed
      on the system and that a valid DECwindows Motif license be registered
      and loaded.

     tory information on all major OpenVMS components, complete reference
     information on system routines and utilities, detailed examples, guide-
     lines for VMScluster systems, programming concepts, a master index,
     and information on the Help Message utility. This set meets the needs
     of system managers and of system and application programmers. It in-
     cludes the Base Documentation Set.
   
     Base Documentation Set
   
     The Base Set includes the most commonly used OpenVMS manuals, address-
     ing the needs of general users and system managers of small standalone

    In addition to the online and hardcopy manuals, several OpenVMS archived
    books will be offered as PostScript files on the OpenVMS Documenta-
    tion CD-ROM. For a complete listing of OpenVMS archived books refer
    to the Overview of OpenVMS Documentation. These books can be ordered
    separately and on demand through the Software Supply Business (SSB)
    group.
   
    Printable PostScript and text files will also be offered for the Re-
    lease Notes, Installation Guides, and SPDs.

    SOURCE LISTINGS
   
    OpenVMS Operating System Source Listings are available on CD-ROM. These
    discs contain all source listings files and the Alpha specific debug
    symbol tables that make up the OpenVMS operating system. Digital pro-
    vides source listings for all key modules of the OpenVMS operating sys-
    tem that are appropriate for end users or application developers. The
    debug symbol files (DSF) on the OpenVMS Alpha Source Listings CD-ROM
    contain information used by the OpenVMS Alpha System-Code Debugger.
    Certain company confidential source listings and debug symbol files,
    however, are excluded from the CD-ROM.
   
    The orderable CD-ROM kit includes the license required to view these
    files on a standalone system or a VMScluster system. If users want to
    make these files available to another system (possibly at a remote 
    site), they will need to purchase another kit.

      Software License Information - VAX
   
      The OpenVMS VAX operating system uses one of two different categories
      of licenses depending on the hardware and software configurations used
      and currently supported. This information is also provided in the ap-
      plicable country's Price List.
   
      These are the two categories of operating system licenses for Open-
      VMS VAX:
   
      1. VAX VMS Licensing
      2. OpenVMS VAX Licensing
   
      Digital provides the proper license type with the purchase of the sys-
      tem. Not all license types are available for every system model.

      OpenVMS Operating System for VAX and Alpha, Version 6.2  25.01.45
   
   
    The VAX VMS licenses include the rights for the DEC Rdb Run-Time Op-
    tion for OpenVMS VAX. This allows the running of an application de-
    veloped using DEC Rdb for OpenVMS VAX software. However, DEC Rdb for
    OpenVMS VAX has separate media and documentation. In addition, should
    a user want to perform Rdb development, a separate license must be pur-
    chased. Refer to SPD 25.59.xx for further information.
   
    Effective February 6, 1995, the VAX VMS (UPI001) licenses no longer
    include the rights for the Digital RDB Run-Time option for OpenVMS VAX,
    and do not permit use of RDB Runtime on prior versions of OpenVMS VAX.
   
    Each of the following license are for a specified hardware system, which
    is either the system the license was originally shipped with or the
    system on which the license was first used:
   
      o  Operating System Base License (QL-001**-**)
   
      o  Operating System User License for OpenVMS VAX (QL-001**-**)
   
      o  Traditional License for OpenVMS VAX (QL-001**-**)
   
      There are four types of VAX VMS licenses:
   
      1. Traditional License (QL-001A*-**)
   
      This type of license provides unlimited use to the users on a defined
      system. VAX VMS traditional licenses are sized to capacity according
      to system type.
   
      2. Multi-User License (QL-001A*-**)
   
      This type of license provides use according to a specified number of
      concurrent users. This is an activity-based license. The Multi-user
      License provides the customer with the right to use the operating sys-
      tem up to the limit of users specified in the license. An operating
      system "user" is a person who is logged in to the system and/or is us-
      ing the system interactively. This license is only available on lim-
      ited system models, primarily MicroVAX and VAX 4000 systems.

      OpenVMS Operating System for VAX and Alpha, Version 6.2  25.01.45
   
   
      Interactive use of VAX systems licensed with the Multi-user License
      may be increased by the addition of OpenVMS User Licenses* (for one
      or more users). Refer to the section on Ordering Information for fur-
      ther information.
   
      3. VAX VMS Workstation License (QL-001A*-**)
   
      This type of license provides use for a single user on a VAX Worksta-
      tion. This license type allows one direct login for the single user
      and then one additional login for system management purposes only.
   
      Additional interactive use of VAX Workstations licensed with the VAX
      VMS Workstation License requires the addition of an OpenVMS User Li-
      cense* (for one or more users). Refer to the section on Ordering In-
      formation for further information.
   
      4. File and Application Server License (QL-001A*-**)
   
      This type of license provides for the noninteractive use of OpenVMS.
   
      OpenVMS based VAXservers are sold with a File and Application Server
      License. The intent of an OpenVMS based VAXserver is to provide file,
      print, application, and compute "services" to "clients" who have re-
      motely submitted their requests (for example via network/remote sub-
      mit/batch jobs, and so forth). This license type also allows one di-
      rect login for system management purposes only.
   
     Additional interactive use of OpenVMS VAXservers licensed with the File
     and Application Server License requires the addition of an OpenVMS User
     License* (for one or more users). Refer to the section on Ordering In-
     formation for further information.
   
      The Operating System Base License provides the right to use only the
      OpenVMS Alpha features of the current version license.
   
      Not all VAX VMS license types are available for all versions of VMS,
      OpenVMS or all VAX models.
   
      *  The OpenVMS VAX Individual Use licenses are not supported by the
         VMS or OpenVMS VAX operating system releases prior to Version 5.5.

      There are four types of OpenVMS VAX licenses:
   
      1. OpenVMS VAX O/S Base License (QL-005A*-**)
   
      LMF Product Name: BASE-VMS-250136
   
      OpenVMS VAX O/S Base License grants the right to unrestricted, non-
      interactive use of the OpenVMS VAX operating system for the execution
      of remotely submitted requests for batch, print, application, and com-
      puting services, on a designated, single processor. This license au-
      thorizes one direct login for system management purposes only.
   
      The OpenVMS VAX Base License does not include the license right for
      the DEC Rdb Run-Time Option for OpenVMS VAX. The DEC Rdb for OpenVMS
      VAX Run-Time License is available separately.
   
      The Operating System Base License is a prerequisite for all Interac-
      tive User Licenses and all SMP Base Extension Licenses.
   
     Interactive use of systems licensed with an OpenVMS VAX O/S Base Li-
     cense requires the addition of an OpenVMS User License (for one or more
     users). Refer to the section on Ordering Information for further in-
     formation.
   
     The Operating System Base License provides the right to use only the
     OpenVMS Alpha features of the current version license.
   
     The OpenVMS VAX O/S Base License also includes the license for DECprint
     Supervisor for OpenVMS VAX. The DECprint Supervisor for OpenVMS VAX
     has separate documentation, media kits, and service products. Refer
     to SPD 44.15.xx for further details.
   
      2. Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP) Base Extension
         License (QL-005A9-6*)
   
      LMF Product Name: BASE-VMS-250136
   
      SMP Base Extensions extend the O/S Base License to enable symmetric
      multiprocessing capability on a select number of OpenVMS VAX systems
      supporting SMP. SMP Base Extensions are permanently tied to the O/S

      Base License and may not be separated from the
      O/S Base License if an SMP board is removed from the system.
   
      SMP Extensions grant the right to use the same version of the oper-
      ating system software as permitted for the corresponding O/S Base Li-
      cense at the time when the SMP Extension is granted.
   
      3. OpenVMS VAX Individual User License
         (QL-XULA*-**)
   
      LMF Product Name: VMS-USER
   
      The OpenVMS VAX Individual User License provides the right to inter-
      actively use the operating system by the specified or unlimited num-
      ber of concurrent users on a designated, single processor. A user is
      an individual who is logged in to a processor and/or is interactively
      using the operating system software by means other than a login. An
      OpenVMS VAX O/S Base License or one of the four types of VAX VMS Li-
      censes (QL-001A*-**) is a prerequisite for the OpenVMS User License.
   
      The Operating System Base License provides the right to use only the
      OpenVMS Alpha features of the current version license.
   
      The OpenVMS VAX O/S Base, the SMP Base Extension, and Interactive User
      licenses are not supported by the VMS or OpenVMS VAX operating sys-
      tem releases prior to OpenVMS VAX Version 5.5.
   
      4. OpenVMS VAX Distributed Interactive User License
         (QL-09SA*-**)
   
      LMF Product Name: ADL-USER
   
      This license grants the right to interactive use of the OpenVMS VAX
      operating system, provided the appropriate Operating System Base Li-
      cense or one of the four types of VAX VMS Licenses has been previously
      installed on a VAX system. The Distributed Interactive User licenses
      are concurrent use licenses and are available in any quantity desired

    except unlimited. Distributed Interactive User licenses are mobile (re-
    designatable) and may be installed and used on a single OpenVMS VAX
    processor, or shared in a single OpenVMS VAXcluster.
   
    A Distributed Interactive user is defined as an individual who is logged
    in to OpenVMS VAX processor or OpenVMS VAXcluster and/or is interac-
    tively using the operating system software by means other than a lo-
    gin.
   
      5. OpenVMS Concurrent Use License (For both VAX and Alpha)
         (QL-MT3A*-3*)
   
      LMF Product Name: OPENVMS-ALPHA-USER-ADL
   
      This license grants the right to interactive use of the OpenVMS op-
      erating system, provided the appropriate OpenVMS Operating System Base
      License is installed on an OpenVMS VAX processor, and/or on an Open-
      VMS Alpha processor, or on OpenVMS VAX processors if one of the four
      types of VAX VMS Licenses has been previously installed on a VAX sys-
      tem. The OpenVMS Concurrent Use licenses are available in any quan-
      tity desired except unlimited. OpenVMS Concurrent Use licenses are mo-
      bile (redesignatable) and may be installed and used on a single Open-
      VMS VAX or OpenVMS Alpha processor, or shared in a single OpenVMS VAX-
      cluster, a single OpenVMS Alpha Cluster, or shared in a mixed Open-
      VMS VAX/Alpha Cluster.
   
      A user that enables a Concurrent Use license is defined as an indi-
      vidual who is logged into an OpenVMS VAX processor, or an OpenVMS Al-
      pha processor, or an OpenVMS VAXcluster, or an OpenVMS Alpha Cluster,
      or a mixed OpenVMS VAX/Alpha Cluster and/or is interactively using the
      OpenVMS operating system software by means other than a login.
   
      When an OpenVMS VAX SMP System upgrade is performed, the SMP Exten-
      sion to the OpenVMS AXP Operating System License permits the use of
      all existing Distributed Interactive User Licenses on the upgraded 
      system.
   
      The Operating System Base License provides the right to use only the
      OpenVMS Alpha features of the current version license.

      by the VMS or OpenVMS VAX operating system releases prior to OpenVMS
      VAX Version 6.0.
   
      OpenVMS Alpha License Information
   
      There are four types of OpenVMS licenses available on Alpha proces-
      sors.
   
    1. Operating System Base License (QL-MT1A*-6*)
   
    LMF Product Name: OpenVMS-ALPHA
   
    This license grants the right to noninteractive use of the remote batch,
    print, application, and computing services of the OpenVMS Alpha op-
    erating system on a single processor. This license authorizes one di-
    rect login for system management purposes only.
   
    The Operating System Base License is a prerequisite for OpenVMS User
    Licenses and SMP Base Extension Licenses.
   
    The Operating System Base License provides the right to use only the
    OpenVMS Alpha features of the current version license.
   
    2. Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP) Base Extension License (QL-MT1A9-
        6*)
   
    LMF Product Name: OpenVMS-ALPHA
   
    SMP Base Extensions extend the Operating System Base License to en-
    able symmetric multiprocessing capability on those OpenVMS Alpha sys-
    tems supporting SMP. SMP Base Extensions are permanently tied to the
    Operating System Base License and may not be separated from the Op-
    erating System Base License if an SMP board is removed from the sys-
    tem.
   
    SMP Extensions grant the right to use the same version of the oper-
    ating system software as permitted for the corresponding Operating Sys-
    tem Base License at the time when the SMP Extension is granted.
   
     3. Individual User License (QL-MT2A*-**)
            (No Longer Offered)
   
      LMF Product Name: OpenVMS-ALPHA-USER
   
                                       63
  
   
   
   
   
      OpenVMS Operating System for VAX and Alpha, Version 6.2  25.01.45
   
   
      This license grants the right to interactive use of the OpenVMS Al-
      pha operating system, provided the appropriate Operating System Base
      License has been previously installed on the OpenVMS Alpha system. The
      Individual User Licenses are available in any quantity desired or as
      an unlimited user license.
   
      Individual User Licenses are redesignatable and may be installed and
      used on a single OpenVMS Alpha processor only. They may not be shared
      in a single OpenVMS Alpha VMScluster environment. An Individual user
      is defined as an user who is logged in an OpenVMS Alpha processor or
      is interactively using the operating system software by means other
      than a login.
   
      This license grants the right to use the same version of the operat-
      ing system software as permitted for the corresponding Operating Sys-
      tem Base License at the time when the Interactive User License is in-
      stalled.
   
      4. OpenVMS Alpha Distributed Interactive User License (QL-MT3A*-**)
            (No Longer Offered)
   
      LMF Product Name: OpenVMS-ALPHA-ADL
   
      This license grants the right to interactive use of the OpenVMS Al-
      pha operating system, provided the appropriate Operating System Base
      License has been previously installed on an Alpha system. The ADL In-
      teractive User Licenses, are concurrent use licenses and are avail-
      able in any quantity desired except unlimited. ADL Interactive User
      Licenses are redesignatable and may be installed and used on a sin-
      gle OpenVMS Alpha processor, or shared in a single OpenVMS Alpha 
      VMScluster environment.
   
    A Distributed Interactive user is defined as an individual who is logged
    in an OpenVMS Alpha processor or OpenVMS Alpha VMScluster or is in-
    teractively using the operating system software by means other than
    a login.
   
    This license grants the right to use the same version of the operat-
    ing system software as permitted for the corresponding Operating Sys-
    tem Base License at the time when the ADL Interactive User License is
    installed.

      5. OpenVMS Concurrent Use License (For both VAX and Alpha) (QL-MT3A*-
         3*)
   
      LMF Product Name: OPENVMS-ALPHA-USER-ADL
   
      This license grants the right to interactive use of the OpenVMS op-
      erating system, provided the appropriate OpenVMS Operating System Base
      License in installed on an OpenVMS VAX processor, and/or on an Open-
      VMS Alpha processor, or on OpenVMS VAX processors if one of the four
      types of VAX VMS Licenses has been previously installed on a VAX sys-
      tem. The OpenVMS Concurrent Use licenses are available in any quan-
      tity desired except unlimited. OpenVMS Concurrent Use licenses are mo-
      bile (redesignatable) and may be installed and used on a single Open-
      VMS VAX or OpenVMS Alpha processor, or shared in a single OpenVMS VAX-
      cluster, a single OpenVMS Alpha Cluster, or shared in a mixed Open-
      VMS VAX/Alpha Cluster.
   
      A user that enables a Concurrent Use license is defined as an indi-
      vidual who is logged into an OpenVMS VAX processor, or an OpenVMS Al-
      pha processor, or an OpenVMS VAXcluster, or an OpenVMS Alpha Cluster,
      or a mixed OpenVMS VAX/Alpha Cluster and/or is interactively using the
      OpenVMS operating system software by means other than a login.
   
      When an Alpha SMP System upgrade is performed, the SMP Base Extension
      to the OpenVMS Alpha Operating System License permits the use of all
      existing ADL Interactive User Licenses on the upgraded system.
   
      License Management Facility Support
   
      The OpenVMS operating system supports Digital's License Management Fa-
      cility (LMF).
   
      If an OpenVMS license is not registered and activated using the Li-
      cense Management Facility, then only a single login is permitted for
      system management purposes through the system console (OPA0:).
   
      Several of the VAX VMS and OpenVMS VAX license types are based on the
      number of concurrent users, called an activity license. Every prod-
      uct has the option to define an activity as related to the License 
      Management Facility. OpenVMS Interactive User and ADL Interactive User

      OpenVMS Operating System for VAX and Alpha, Version 6.2  25.01.45
   
   
      Licenses define the number of concurrent users that are activity li-
      censes as defined by the LMF. OpenVMS defines activities, sometimes
      referred to as an OpenVMS "user", as follows:
   
      o  Each remote terminal connection is considered an activity. This is
         true even if users set host to their local nodes (SET HOST 0).
   
      o  Each connection from a terminal server is considered an activity.
   
      o  A multiple-window session on a workstation is considered one ac-
         tivity, regardless of the number of windows.
   
      o  A batch job is not considered an activity.
   
      o  A remote network connection that is a connection other than a re-
         mote terminal connection, is not considered an activity.

   ppendix A
   
   his appendix describes Digital Equipment Corporation terminals, disks,
   apes, controllers, graphics, and network options. Some restrictions
   or specific devices are listed, if applicable.
   
   gital reserves the right to change the number and type of devices
   pported by OpenVMS Alpha, OpenVMS VAX, DECnet for OpenVMS Alpha, 
   Cnet-VAX, DECnet/OSI, and OpenVMS Cluster Software. The minimum hardware
   quirements for future versions and updates of these software products 
   y be different from current hardware requirements. For configuration de-
   ils about Alpha or VAX hardware, refer to the Systems and Options
   talog and the Network and Communications Buyers Guide.
   
   fer to the following SPDs for detailed product information: DECnet 
   r OpenVMS (SPD 48.48.xx), DECnet/OSI (SPD 50.45.xx, 25.03.xx) and 
   enVMS Cluster Software (SPD 29.78.xx).
   
   erminals and Terminal Line Interfaces
   
   o prevent input from overflowing a buffer, terminals use the ASCII
   ontrol characters DC1 and DC3 for synchronization as defined by Dig-
   tal's DEC STD 111, Revision A. VXT windowing terminals support stan-
   ard ANSI applications and X windows using the LAT transport proto-
   ol.
   
   he following table lists the terminals that are supported by Open-
   MS Alpha:
   
      VT200 series   VT300  series   VT400 series
   
      VT500 series   VXT 2000 series
   
   The following table lists the terminals that are supported by Open-
   VMS VAX:

    Terminals on Professional 350, Rainbow 100, and DECmate II systems em-
    ulate VT100 terminals.
   
    Only limited support is available for the VT52. The VT131, when run-
    ning an application, operates in block mode. When interacting with Open-
    VMS VAX and associated utilities, the VT131 operates only in VT100 (or
    interactive) mode and not in block mode.
   
    Note: The VT1000 is a monochrome windowing terminal that supports stan-
    dard ANSI applications and "X" windows. The transport protocols sup-
    ported are LAT for VMS. The product supports 15-inch and 19-inch mon-
    itors.
   
    Disks
   
    The first column lists the disk drive. The second column is a descrip-
    tion of the device. The third column lists the bus the device is sup-
    ported on. The fourth column lists the minimum required version of Open-
    VMS Alpha that supports these devices.The fifth column lists the min-
    imum required version of OpenVMS VAX that supports these devices. ("NS"
    stands for "Not Supported")
