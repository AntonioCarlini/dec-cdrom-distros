 PRODUCT NAME:  ALL-IN-1 OSO TeamLinks Connection V2.5 SPD: 37.90.03
                for OpenVMS Alpha V3.1 and OpenVMS VAX
                V3.1, V3.0A

 DESCRIPTION

 The TeamLinks[TM] Connection V2.5 (TLC V2.5) gives TeamLinks V2.5 clients
 extensive access to ALL-IN-1[TM] Office Server Options (OSO) V3.1 Open-
 VMS[TM] Alpha and VAX[TM] and ALL-IN-1 V3.0A VAX systems, enabling Team-
 Links V2.5 users to utilize new TeamLinks client features in associ-
 ation with ALL-IN-1 OSO mail, file cabinet, and directory services.
 The TLC V2.5 comprises a File Cabinet Server that gives comprehensive
 access to the ALL-IN-1 File Cabinet, the ALL-IN-1 Distributed Access
 server, remote broker, licensing mechanisms, and the necessary sys-
 tem management required to manage the servers.

 The installation of the TLC V2.5 to existing ALL-IN-1 V3.1 systems re-
 quires that the OpenVMS operating system, ALL-IN-1 V3.1, and DECnet[TM]
 or TCP/IP software be installed prior to the installation of the TLC
 V2.5-for details see below.

 The installation of the TLC V2.5 to existing ALL-IN-1 V3.0A systems
 requires that the OpenVMS VAX operating system, ALL-IN-1 V3.0A, TLC
 V2.1 and DECnet or TCP/IP be installed prior to the installation of
 the TLC V2.5-for details see below.

 For new installations of ALL-IN-1 V3.1, the TLC V2.5 is shipped with
 the ALL-IN-1 V3.1 media kit and can be optionally installed to sup-
 port TeamLinks V2.5 clients in addition to TeamLinks V2.1 and V2.0 clients.

 The TLC V2.5 enables the TeamLinks Mail for Microsoft[R] Windows[TM]
 V2.5 client and the TeamLinks Mail for Apple[R] Macintosh[R] V2.5 client
 users to gain access to the following key services available on ALL-IN-1
 V3.1 and V3.0A systems:

 o  System Management

 minal emulation include extensions to ALL-IN-1 System Management, which
 enables the system manager to start and stop both the File Cabinet Server
 and the ALL-IN-1 Distributed Access server. TCP/IP links are automat-
 ically re-established in the event of having to restart the servers.

                                  4

 

 o  Broadcast Server

 Alternative TCP/IP products-TGV MultiNet[R] and Wollongong PathWay-
 are supported transports, and both support broadcast to TeamLinks V2.1
 and V2.5 clients.

 PC broadcast over TCP/IP now supports node number as an alternative
 to node name.

 Caution: When an ALL-IN-1 VT user transitions to the TeamLinks V2.* client,
 ALL-IN-1 V3.0A does not support all of the X.400 '84 attributes avail-
 able on the TeamLinks V2.* Client. This is not the case with ALL-IN-1
 V3.1, where all X.400 attributes are supported.

 The level of client service can be extended beyond that offered by the
 TeamLinks V2.* clients. A full complement of Application Programming
 Interfaces (APIs) is provided to the ALL-IN-1 File Cabinet Server and
 ALL-IN-1 Distributed Access Server for application developers.

 Operational Restriction

 A TeamLinks connection to ALL-IN-1 cannot be established if the Team-
 Links ALL-IN-1 account is based on an account where multiple ALL-IN-1
 users share a single OpenVMS account. Each TeamLinks user must have
 an individual ALL-IN-1 account.

 SOFTWARE LICENSING

 TeamLinks Connection V2.5 is not of itself licensed and no PAK or LMF
 check is required.

 For information on ALL-IN-1 OSO server licensing of TeamLinks clients
 please refer to the ALL-IN-1 SPD 27.30.**.

 Note: Not all ALL-IN-1 VT functionality is supported by the TeamLinks
 V2.5 client.

 Media, documentation, and services are provided through ALL-IN-1 OSO
 V3.1.

 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

 Hardware requirements are governed by the prerequisite software for
 ALL-IN-1 OSO for OpenVMS.

 Processors Supported

 OpenVMS Alpha

 All OpenVMS Alpha and AlphaServer[TM] systems are supported. Recom-
 mended minimum memory size is 64MB. However, for very small instal-
 lations, ALL-IN-1 OSO V3.1 will run in 32MB but performance may suf-
 fer as the system-resident portion of ALL-IN-1 is greater than 50MB.

 OpenVMS VAX

 All OpenVMS VAX systems are supported except:

    MicroVAX[TM]: MicroVAX I
    VAXstation[TM]: VAXstation I, VAXstation 8000
    VAX-11/725, VAX-11/730, VAX-11/750, VAX-11/782

 Note: Recommended minimum memory size is 32MB

 No VAXserver[TM] processors are supported, as they do not support in-
 teractive ALL-IN-1 operations. Interactive operations from VT or ter-
 minal emulation are required to manage ALL-IN-1 OSO and the TLC V2.5.

 Processor Restrictions

 ALL-IN-1 does not support diskless satellite systems in Ethernet and
 mixed interconnect clusters.

 For further information on ALL-IN-1 Server options, refer to the ALL-IN-1
 Server Software Product Description (SPD 27.30.**).

 Please note: Digital acknowledges that a plethora of third-party PCs,
 PC BIOS, network interfaces, and network software stacks can be de-
 ployed in conjunction with all versions of the TLC and ALL-IN-1. Dig-
 ital has observed that some combinations of these third-party prod-
 ucts do not exhibit correct behavior, resulting in intermittent or per-
 manent user-perceived problems. If such conditions occur, Digital re-
 serves the right to recommend combinations of the above that are known
 to behave correctly to solve actual customer interoperability prob-
 lems. In addition, Digital will not be held responsible for support-
 ing combinations of third-party products used in conjunction with the
 TLC and ALL-IN-1 that are known to behave improperly or to consistently
 exhibit incorrect operation on customer sites.

 Note: In order for TeamLinks users and ALL-IN-1 VT users to exchange
 information (e.g. Microsoft Word to WPS-PLUS), conversion services in
 addition to the integral CDA libraries may be required. The KEYpak li-
 brary from FTP Software Canada Ltd., has been integrated into ALL-IN-1
 V3.1 OpenVMS Alpha and VAX but is not included in the kit.

 GROWTH CONSIDERATIONS

 There may be a future version of this application to provide additional
 functionality to subsequent releases of TeamLinks clients.
