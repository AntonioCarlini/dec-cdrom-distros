     PRODUCT NAME:  VAX ADE, Version 2.5                 SPD 25.76.09
                    Information Management for Office Professionals

     DESCRIPTION

     ADE is specifically designed to help managers, administrative
     and clerical personnel, and other office professionals manage
     their own information. ADE users can create and manage informa-
     tion files as well as produce a variety of reports. An on-line
     tutorial makes ADE extremely easy to learn, while extensive HELP
     messages and a self-prompting command structure make ADE easy
     to use. ADE allows users to produce and use simple applications
     without learning programming techniques or languages.

     The ADE user defines a Worksheet by naming the column headings
     needed for the data. The data is then entered through the user's
     terminal and is displayed on the terminal screen under the
     appropriate column headings. Data or columns can be added,
     changed, or deleted at any time. Column widths are automatically
     adjusted to accommodate the data being entered. Once entered,
     the data can be manipulated and reports can be printed.

     The standard ADE report format automatically prints information
     in a columnar format, numbers pages, centers titles, and centers
     data under column headings. With a little more effort, the
     ADE user can select specific data to be printed and format the
     report to meet specific needs.

     ADE uses Self-prompting Commands to manage information and to
     print reports. The user enters a single word command telling ADE
     what to do. If not sure which command to use, HELP will give the
     user a list of choices with a brief description, or the TRAIN
     command can be used to learn about the various commands. Once
     the command is entered, ADE prompts the user for any additional

     information that is needed. HELP and TRAIN are always available.
     As the user becomes more familiar with ADE, abbreviations can be
     used and the entire ADE command can be entered without selecting
     from the available options at each step. This greatly increases
     the frequent user's productivity.

     ADE also has several advanced features that add to its useful-
     ness. The most powerful of these is the creation of Verbs. A
     Verb is a name that the user gives to a specific sequence of
     commands. That sequence of commands can then be performed by
     simply entering the name of the Verb as if it was a command.
     This is a great time saver for those tasks that are repeated day
     after day.

     Another advanced ADE feature is the ability to insert ADE Print
     Files into a single ADE Report. The inserted Print Files can be
     Listings, Plots, or other ADE Reports. This feature allows the
     ADE user to create complex reports out of many simpler pieces.
