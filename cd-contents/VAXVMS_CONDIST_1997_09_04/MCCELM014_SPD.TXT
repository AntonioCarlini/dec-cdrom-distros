           PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER Extended LAN Manager, Version 1.4     SPD
           38.67.05                (Formerly DECmcc Extended LAN Manager)

           OVERVIEW

           POLYCENTER Extended LAN Manager Option Packages are OpenVMS and UL-
           TRIX layered products that enable POLYCENTER Framework Family prod-
           uct users to configure, manage, monitor, and control LAN Bridge, DECbridge,
           and DECconcentrator 500 devices in the "Extended LAN" and FDDI net-
           work environment. The term LAN Bridge is used to refer to Digital Equip-
           ment Corporation's LAN Bridge 100, LAN Bridge 150, LAN Bridge 200, METROWAVE
           Bridge, and Chipcom®'s Ethermodem[TM] Broadband Bridge. The term DECbridge
           is used to refer to Digital Equipment Corporation's DECbridge 500 and
           600 Series products.

           The LAN Bridge and DECbridge products are the primary building blocks
           of the "Extended LAN" (Local Area Network) architecture. An Extended
           LAN is a collection of LANs that are interconnected and logically ap-
           pear as one large Local Area Network. The DECconcentrator family of
           products is the primary building block of the FDDI network environ-
           ment. Together these environments are physically and logically attached
           and extended via the DECbridge family of products. The DECbridge prod-
           uct line is the family of products which allow Ethernet and FDDI net-
           works to communicate transparently.

           The LAN Bridge and DECbridge products operate at the data link level,
           and FDDI DECconcentrators operate at the data link and physical link
           levels. Both product sets are transparent to upper level protocols.

           (Formerly DECmcc Extended LAN Manager)

           PACKAGE OPTIONS

           The POLYCENTER Extended LAN Manager package options can be added to
           selected POLYCENTER Framework Family products to provide management
           of LAN Bridges, DECbridges, and FDDI DECconcentrators. There are two
           POLYCENTER Extended LAN Manager license option packages.

           o  POLYCENTER Extended LAN Manager Access Module (AM)-provides man-
              agement protocol support for, and user access to, LAN Bridges, DECbridges,
              and FDDI DECconcentrators. This package, added to either the POLY-
              CENTER Framework or the POLYCENTER Network Manager 200 enables users
              to take full advantage of those products' integrated command set,
              graphic and command line user interfaces, and extensibility to reg-
              ister, monitor, and control devices supported by the AM and FM. This
              AM and FM license package also enables POLYCENTER users to customize
              alarm rules and generate performance statistics for the supported
              devices.

           o  POLYCENTER Extended LAN Manager Functional Module (FM)-can option-
              ally be added to a POLYCENTER Framework. Used in conjunction with
              the POLYCENTER Extended LAN Manager AM package, it provides POLY-
              CENTER Framework users with automatic device registration, FDDI ring
              map autotopology and LAN Bridge spanning tree autotopology support-
              ing IEEE 802.1d spanning tree and Digital's LAN Bridge 100 span-
              ning tree protocols.

           Depending on the user's POLYCENTER configuration, an additional soft-
           ware license may be required. Refer to the SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS sec-
           tion for more detail.

           GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS

           This release of POLYCENTER Extended LAN Manager is the release of soft-
           ware which supersedes the DECelms point product functionality for the
           POLYCENTER environment. The Extended LAN Manager AM and FM modules to-
           gether provide additional functionality to DECelms.

           and licensed VAXcluster* configuration without restrictions. The HARD-
           WARE REQUIREMENTS section details any special hardware required by this

           IMPORTANT INTEROPERABILITY INFORMATION FOR OPENVMS USERS ONLY

           Interoperability problems may occur when more than one product con-
           taining DECthreads is installed on a system. This occurs because some
           products overwrite the system version of DECthreads. If a product with
           a different version of DECthreads is installed after POLYCENTER Frame-
           work, problems may occur.

           POLYCENTER Framework V1.4 is linked with DECthreads V1.0-422. Later
           versions of DECthreads have a backwards compatible API. Consequently,
           no problem should result from having a more recent version of DECthreads
           on the system.

           Only SSB versions of DECthreads are supported.

           o  OpenVMS VAX Operating System V5.5-2 to V6.1
