 PRODUCT NAME:  VAX Message Router/S Gateway, Version 1.3        SPD
 29.24.03

 DESCRIPTION

 VAX Message Router/S Gateway (MRS) is a network server layered soft-
 ware product that resides on an OpenVMS[TM] VAX[TM] system providing
 interconnection between MAILbus[TM], Digital Equipment Corporation's
 Message Router based electronic message transfer service, and IBM[R]'s
 Systems Network Architecture Distribution Services (SNADS). Through
 MRS, users of Digital office automation systems such as DEC MAILworks[TM]
 or ALL-IN-1[TM] Integrated Office System can send and receive messages,
 documents, notes, and binary files (for example, MS-DOS[R] files) to
 and from users of IBM office systems, such as Personal Services/CICS
 or OfficeVision[TM]/MVS.

 VAX Message Router/S Gateway provides both address and content con-
 version for messages and documents passed between the Digital and IBM
 office networks. In this way, users are not required to learn new com-
 mands or procedures except the new addresses representing the users
 of the other network(s) with whom they can now communicate by means
 of MRS. MRS connects to an IBM DISOSS system, which contains the host
 implementation of SNADS. Other SNADS nodes have access to the Digi-
 tal network through their SNA connections to that IBM host. No Dig-
 ital software is required to be installed on the IBM system to accom-
 plish these transfers. With some restrictions, MRS allows users of those
 IBM office systems to communicate through MAILbus to other networks
 including X.400 public messaging services.

 Message address conversion is accomplished through the Directory Ser-
 vice (DDS) function of Message Router. Each Digital user sending and
 receiving mail to and from IBM users must be registered in DDS and as-
 signed an "alias" or virtual address for the SNADS network. Limited
 one-way message transfer from MAILbus to IBM is possible without user

 registration in DDS. The recipient (addressee) list of a single mes-
 sage and stored distribution lists can include both Digital and IBM
 users. Delivery Confirmation and Non-Delivery Notification messages
 are supported.

 During MRS configuration, a number of options for message content con-
 version may be chosen on a per-gateway basis. To preserve maximum re-
 visable content, messages and documents from the Digital network can
 be converted to IBM's DCA Revisable Format. Where users of IBM sys-
 tems only have access to simple text editors, conversions can be made
 to IBM's DCA Final Format or to DISOSS Note format. Digital text mes-
 sages with one or more attached text documents may be concatenated into
 a single document for transfer to the SNADS network. Alternatively mes-
 sages containing multiple attachments from the Digital MAILbus net-
 work can be separated into multiple individual messages by MRS for on-
 ward transmission to the SNADS network since the IBM network does not
 support messages with more than one attachment. The product documen-
 tation describes the capabilities and limitations regarding this func-
 tionality.

 Binary non-text file types, identified in the Digital network as DEC-
 bodypart 7 (FOREIGN) or DECbodypart 11 (MS-DOS), will be transferred
 unconverted to the IBM SNADS network. Such files, sent from a Digi-
 tal to an IBM SNADS network, will lose their Digital RMS attributes.
 Binary file transfer is primarily intended for the transfer of MS-DOS
 files between the Digital and IBM networks. Files tagged as DCA files
 (for example, a document produced on a PC word processing system) can
 be identified in the SNADS network as a DCA document. Not all Digi-
 tal User Agents and Gateways can append these tags to DECbodypart 7
 or DECbodypart 11 files. Multiple binary files attached to a single
 message may be passed to the IBM environment as multiple messages. These
 conversion options are chosen during MRS configuration.

 ALL-IN-1 Integrated Office System can automatically convert DECdx for-
 mat to WPS-PLUS format. Other Digital user agents and MAILbus Gate-
 ways can convert DECdx format to a format appropriate to their func-
 tion. Since the capabilities of each vendor's word processing systems
 are not identical, and since some control information is not trans-
 mitted, not all attributes and functions are converted. The MRS prod-
 uct documentation lists the restrictions. Users are responsible for

                                  4

 

 understanding the capabilities of destination systems when sending bi-
 nary files. Binary file transfer should not be used with ALL-IN-1 In-
 tegrated Office System, Version 2.2 or earlier or VMSmail (the Open-
 VMS Mail Utility), Version 5.1 or earlier.

 A single MRS installation will support messaging services between a
 SNADS network of IBM office systems and a MAILbus network of Digital
 OpenVMS systems and between the SNADS network and any other messag-
 ing network connected to that MAILbus. Service levels obtained in the
 latter case will depend on the characteristics of this other network.

 To provide connection to MAILbus, the VAX Message Router software is
 required by and included with the software license and media kit for
 VAX Message Router/S Gateway.

 INSTALLATION

 MRS forms only one part of a distributed multi-vendor electronic mes-
 saging application. Important activities, such as coordination with
 other messaging components, modification of the IBM system parameters
 and the creation or update of subscriber entries in the directory ser-
 vice, must precede the installation of this product. Digital offers
 a number of services to assist customers with these tasks. Refer to
 the SOFTWARE PRODUCT SERVICES section of this SPD for more informa-
 tion.

 Only experienced customers should attempt installation of this prod-
 uct. Digital recommends that all other customers purchase Digital's
 Installation Services. These services provide for installation of the
 software product by an experienced Digital Software Specialist.

 Digital's Installation Services can be purchased as a separate ser-
 vice.

 Customer Responsibilities

 Before Digital installation of the software the customer must:

 o  Previously have installed all prerequisite hardware including ter-
    minals.

                                  5

 

 o  Obtain, install and demonstrate as operational any modems and other
    equipment and facilities necessary to interface to Digital's com-
    munications equipment.

 o  Demonstrate equivalency of operation for modems other than Bell Sys-
    tem 201C, 208A or 209A type modems, or, in Europe, PTT approved modems.

 o  Have generated, to Digital's satisfaction, any necessary IBM host
    software that will be communicating with the DECnet SNA Gateway or
    VMS/SNA and VAX Message Router/S.

 o  Make available for a reasonable period of time, as mutually agreed
    by Digital and the customer, all hardware, communications facil-
    ities, and terminals that are to be used during the installation.

 Delays caused by any failure to meet these responsibilities will be
 charged at the prevailing rates for time and materials.

 Successful use of this product requires:

 o  The customer must be prepared to work with both Digital and IBM sys-
    tems personnel to coordinate the installation activities.

 o  The customer should be capable of modifying IBM component gener-
    ation parameters to support the DECnet SNA Gateway or VMS/SNA and
    VAX Message Router/S Gateway.
