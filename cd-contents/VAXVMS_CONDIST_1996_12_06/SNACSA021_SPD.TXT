 PRODUCT NAME:  DECnet SNA Gateway for Channel Transport,        SPD
 29.76.04                Version 2.1A

 DESCRIPTION

 DECnet SNA Gateway for Channel Transport (DECnet SNA Gateway-CT) is
 a member of the DECnet SNA Transport product family. This family con-
 sists of hardware and software products that allow users to exchange
 information and share resources between suitably configured Digital
 systems in a DECnet environment and IBM[R] systems in a Systems Net-
 work Architecture (SNA) environment.

 Users on one or more Digital systems can simultaneously perform func-
 tions such as accessing IBM application programs or other system re-
 sources, act as a 3270 display station, perform data transfer between
 Digital and IBM file systems, exchange electronic documents and mail
 messages, submit jobs to IBM batch subsystems acting as a Remote Job
 Entry workstation, and implement distributed, task-to-task applica-
 tion programs that run between Digital and IBM systems.

 The DECnet SNA Transport product set provides a means of connecting
 DECnet and SNA networks which can be used by a wide variety of Digital-
 supplied access routines running on OpenVMS AXP, OpenVMS VAX, MS-DOS[R],
 and ULTRIX operating environments. The Gateway-CT is managed and con-
 figured using the DECnet SNA management software that is part of the

                               DIGITAL                   August 1993

                                                         AE-LE83E-TE

 

 DECnet SNA Gateway-CT product. For additional information on the var-
 ious access routines and their capabilities, please consult the OP-
 TIONAL SOFTWARE section of the System Support Addendum (SSA 29.76.04-
 x).

 DECnet SNA Gateway-CT is part of both the DECnet and the SNA networks.
 Architecturally, it is a DECnet Phase IV end node to DECnet and a Phys-
 ical Unit Type 2.0 node to SNA. It provides bidirectional access be-
 tween DECnet and SNA networks.

 The DECnet SNA Gateway-CT software is supported on two hardware plat-
 forms - the DEC ChannelServer (DESNA-Ax) and DEC ChannelServer II (DESNB-
 Ax). Both systems connect directly to an Ethernet local area network
 (LAN) and an IBM S/370 Byte Multiplexor, Block Multiplexor, or Selec-
 tor channel. When used with DECnet SNA Gateway-CT, they provide SNA
 connectivity to any Phase IV (or Phase IV+) DECnet system in the DEC-
 net network. This product can be used in networks currently using other
 DECnet SNA Gateway systems and can share access routines, Ethernet LANs,
 and load host resources with those systems.

 DECnet SNA Gateway-CT software is downline loaded into the DEC Chan-
 nelServer or DEC ChannelServer II system. Software media must be or-
 dered in addition to the DEC ChannelServer hardware. Other DECnet sys-
 tems wishing access to the SNA environment through the DEC ChannelServer
 or DEC ChannelServer II, should be configured with the appropriate DEC-
 net SNA access routine(s).

 DECnet SNA Gateway-CT and the DEC ChannelServer/DEC ChannelServer II
 support a single set of Bus and Tag connectors to an IBM S/370 Byte
 Multiplexor, Block Multiplexor, or Selector channel. Channel type and
 address may be configured according to specifications listed in both
 the hardware and the software user documentation.

 Loading DECnet SNA Gateway-CT Software

 The DEC ChannelServer/DEC ChannelServer II requires software to be loaded
 into memory prior to DECnet SNA Gateway operation. DECnet SNA Gateway-
 CT software is downline loaded into the hardware over the Ethernet LAN
 from an OpenVMS or ULTRIX system acting as DECnet load host system.

                                  2

 

 Most AXP, VAX, MicroVAX, VAXserver, VAXstation, DECsystem, and DEC-
 station systems running OpenVMS or ULTRIX are supported as Ethernet
 load hosts for DECnet SNA Gateway-CT. Supported OpenVMS and ULTRIX con-
 figurations are described in the System Support Addendum (SSA 29.76.04-
 x).

 DECnet SNA Gateway Management

 DECnet SNA gateway management software, which is part of the DECnet
 SNA Gateway-CT, provides configuration and management functions for
 use with DECnet SNA Gateway for Channel Transport V2.1A. This manage-
 ment software allows the Gateway administrator to configure the soft-
 ware executing in the DECnet SNA Gateway-CT system. The administra-
 tor can set up parameters relating to lines, circuits, physical units,
 logical units, and other key variables necessary for network-to-network
 communications between the DECnet and SNA networks. Additionally, the
 gateway management software allows the administrator to manage and di-
 agnose problems related to the DECnet SNA Gateway-CT.

 DECnet SNA gateway management software is required on the Digital load
 host node for DECnet SNA Gateway-CT. It must also be present on any
 other OpenVMS or ULTRIX node where users want to manage a DEC Chan-
 nelServer/DEC ChannelServer II (DECnet SNA Gateway-CT)-based Gateway.
 It is strongly recommended that the software also be installed on OpenVMS
 or ULTRIX systems in order to facilitate debugging functions where IBM
 Interconnect application programs are developed using any of the DEC-
 net SNA Programming Interface products.

 Gateway management software includes DECnet style network management
 tools for configuring, controlling, monitoring, and troubleshooting
 for DECnet SNA Gateway itself. These activities are generally performed
 by the Digital system manager responsible for the designated load host
 node. Most management functions are performed from a node on the Dig-
 ital network rather than at or on the Gateway itself.






                                  3

 

 Management of the DECnet SNA Gateway should be viewed as part of the
 Digital environment, while the management of the lines and/or chan-
 nel connecting the DECnet SNA Gateway to the IBM system is a joint re-
 sponsibility of the IBM and Digital system managers. (Refer to the Cus-
 tomer Responsibilities section of this Software Product Description.)

 DECnet SNA gateway management software allows a Digital system oper-
 ator to bootstrap or restart a DECnet SNA Gateway remotely and pro-
 vide configuration and initialization facilities for the DECnet SNA
 Gateway.

 Problem Isolation and Determination Tools for the Gateway

 In addition to event logging and error counters, a wide range of fault
 isolation tools are included.

 Trace capabilities, snatrace for ULTRIX and SNATRACE and NETTRACE for
 OpenVMS, are provided with the DECnet SNA Gateway-CT to help debug ap-
 plication programs as well as assist in identifying system problems.
 An operator can run a trace at the Circuit, Physical Unit (PU), or Ses-
 sion level, and then format the data on a specified Digital system.
 The trace features are helpful in identifying an error for remedial
 action.

 A snapshot monitoring utility is provided to display on a Digital host-
 controlled terminal the status of the Gateway's buffer availability,
 the number of SNA sessions currently in progress, and other informa-
 tion that pertains to both the DECnet and SNA network.

 If an irrecoverable error should occur during operation of the DEC-
 net SNA Gateway system, a memory image may be dumped to a designated
 Ethernet attached AXP, VAX, or RISC host. This memory image may then
 be provided to your Digital support personnel for problem diagnosis.
