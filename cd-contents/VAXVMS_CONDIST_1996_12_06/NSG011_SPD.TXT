 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC SecurityGate for OpenVMS[*], Version 1.1     SPD
 36.20.01

 DESCRIPTION

 DEC SecurityGate software is a VMS software product that, when installed
 on a DECnet Phase IV routing node, provides an additional level of ac-
 cess control to that part of the network served by the routing node.
 A system or security manager can use the DEC SecurityGate software to
 create a security domain consisting of a group of nodes serviced by
 the router.

 A system or security manager defines a set of access rules that ap-
 ply to the security domain. Access to nodes in the security domain can
 be specified and controlled based on source and destination nodes, source
 username, inbound and outbound communication lines, network object or
 task, and the day of week and hour of day.

 The DEC SecurityGate software consists of a VMS pseudo driver that pro-
 vides the network access control, a user interface program that cre-
 ates and maintains rules databases and controls the loading of net-
 work access control rules, and an Ancillary Control Process (ACP) that
 provides event logging and loads rules into the pseudo driver.

 DEC SecurityGate software pseudo driver software becomes part of the
 DECnet-VAX routing layer and examines each network packet passing through.
 Each packet is examined to determine if it is a Connect Request or a
 Reconnect Request. Only Connect and Reconnect Requests are further ex-
 amined; all others are passed back to the router for forwarding.

 The DEC SecurityGate forwards Connect Requests if permitted by the ac-
 cess rules but rejects Connect Requests if prohibited by the rules.
 Since only Connect Request packets and Reconnect Request packets are
 examined, the effect on network routing performance is small.

 The ACP maintains an audit event file that automatically records all
 failed network connections and changes to the access rules. The User
 Interface will display the entire audit file or create a report from
 selected portions which, in turn, can be either displayed or printed
 as a separate file.

 The User Interface also provides a test function. A security manager
 can determine if the rules that are defined will behave as expected
 by simulating Connect Requests and verifying that the rules either per-
 mit or deny access.
