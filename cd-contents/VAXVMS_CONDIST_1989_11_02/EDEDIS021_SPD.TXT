PRODUCT NAME:	External Document Exchange with IBM DISOSS,	SPD 26.92.03
		Version 2.1

DESCRIPTION

External Document Exchange (EDE) with IBM(r) DISOSS(tm), Version 2.1 is a VMS 
layered product which allows the DIGITAL office automation user access to text 
information distributed through or contained in an IBM DISOSS/370 (Distributed 
Office Support System/370) system. Users of either DIGITAL's ALL-IN-1 office 
system or DECdx/VMS software can search for, retrieve, file or delete 
documents in IBM DISOSS Library Services. Similarly through DISOSS 
Distribution Services, DIGITAL office automation users can send and receive 
documents to and from users of IBM office systems connected to the DISOSS/370 
system. Thus, a user can receive a document created by another user in an IBM 
SNA(tm) (Systems Network Architecture) office network environment, edit it locally 
on the DIGITAL system, distribute it through a DIGITAL office network, print 
it out or file it in the DISOSS/370 document library. 

Operation of EDE with IBM DISOSS, Version 2.1 is initiated through an easy-to- 
use menu interface which can be added to the ALL-IN-1 office system or invoked 
from the DCL system prompt when used with DECdx/VMS. The functions supported 
correspond to the command structure of Library and Distribution Services found 
in IBM'S DISOSS/370 office applications. The user interface for operating the 
functions of search, file, retrieve and delete document, send, obtain, show 
and cancel distribution were produced to be compatible with DIGITAL standard 
user interface requirements for office products. A context specific on-line 
help capability is included with the product. 

Both DCA(tm) (Document Content Architecture) Revisable Form Text and DCA Final 
Form Text documents may be retrieved by EDE with IBM DISOSS. EDE with IBM 
DISOSS converts the IBM DISOSS DCA formatted text of these retrieved documents 
into DIGITAL document exchange (DX), DEC Standard Document File Format and 
stores the converted documents in the users DECdx or ALL-IN-1 filing cabinet. 
Documents being sent from the DIGITAL system for filing in or distribution 
through the IBM DISOSS system are converted from DX format into IBM DCA 
revisable form. ASCII and other text files can be sent from ALL-IN-1 and are 
converted into DCA Final Form documents prior to filing in or distribution 
through the IBM DISOSS/370 system. When using the WPS-PLUS word processing 
editor under ALL-IN-1 conversions between WPS-PLUS and DX format occur without 
user intervention. Otherwise the Convert Document utility within ALL-IN-1 
allows the conversion of documents to and from other formats used by ALL-IN-1. 

The library search function of EDE with IBM DISOSS creates an index of DISOSS 
documents on the VAX system accessible to a user. This simplifies subsequent 
access to those documents since the user need only refer to this index (which 
contains reference to the DISOSS Library Assigned Document Name) to operate on 
the document in the DISOSS/370 database. A single command can be used to 
obtain all documents awaiting delivery to a user from DISOSS Distribution 
Serves. Not all the format commands and print attributes can be converted 
between DX and DISOSS. The User's Manual lists the exceptions. 

At the IBM host, the system manager must define the DIGITAL External Document 
Exchange users to DISOSS in its Host User Profile (HUP). Communication between 
the DIGITAL system running EDE with IBM DISOSS, Version 2.1 and the IBM system 
takes place over a DECnet link to a DECnet/SNA Gateway system and then over an 
SNA link to the particular IBM system.  Alternatively, if EDE with IBM DISOSS 
is installed on a standalone VAX system, VMS/SNA software may be utilized on 
those VAX processors supported by it, instead of the DECnet/SNA gateway 
system, to provide single system connection to the IBM network.

INSTALLATION

Only experienced customers should attempt installation of this product. 
DIGITAL recommends that all other customers purchase DIGITAL's Installation 
Services.  These services provide for installation of the software product by 
an experienced DIGITAL Software Specialist.

DIGITAL's Installation Services can be purchased as a separate service. 

Customer Responsibilities

Before DIGITAL installation of the software the customer must:

-   Previously have installed all requisite hardware including terminals

-   Obtain, install and demonstrate as operational any modems and other 
    equipment and facilities necessary to interface to DIGITAL's 
    communications equipment

-   Demonstrate equivalency of operation for modems other than Bell System 
    201C, 208A or 209A type modems, or, in Europe, PTT approved modems

-   Have generated, to DIGITAL's satisfaction, any necessary IBM host software 
    that will be communicating with the DECnet/SNA Gateway or VMS/SNA and EDE 
    with IBM DISOSS

-   Make available for a reasonable period of time, as mutually agreed by 
    DIGITAL and the customer, all hardware, communications facilities, and 
    terminals that are to be used during the installation 

Delays caused by any failure to meet these responsibilities will be charged  
at the prevailing rates for time and materials.

Successful use of this product requires that:

-   The customer must be prepared to work with both DIGITAL and IBM systems 
    personnel to coordinate the installation activities.

-   The customer should be capable of modifying IBM component generation 
    parameters to support the DECnet/SNA Gateway or VMS/SNA and EDE with IBM 
    DISOSS
