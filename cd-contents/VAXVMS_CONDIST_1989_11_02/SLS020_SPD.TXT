VAX Storage Library System, Version 2.0                   SPD 29.67.02

DESCRIPTION

The VAX Storage Library System (SLS) is a VMS layered software product that  
provides users with the ability to: manage data archiving activities and 
the  VMS BACKUP activities on their systems, manage the resulting media and 
each piece of media's location, and manage the devices associated with the 
archive or backup activities.

The media that is managed and tracked by VAX SLS software includes 
reel-to-reel magnetic tape, cartridge tape, and optical cartridges. The 
devices that are managed by VAX SLS software are all VMS-supported 
reel-to-reel tape drives, all VMS-supported  cartridge tape drives 
(including the TA90 with loader), the RV20 optical drive, and the RV64 
optical jukebox.

With the VAX Storage Library System software, users are able to maintain a 
record of all information on BACKUP or archived media and retrieve this 
information quickly.

Key capabilities of VAX SLS software are:

oo   Automatic scheduling of system backups

oo   An on-line catalog that tracks files, savesets, volumes, and physical 
    media locations

oo   Optionally, a secondary master database with automatic failover when 
    the primary master database node fails

oo   Ability to customize VAX SLS features to meet the operational and site 
    requirements

oo   Unattended archiving and backups by means of support for the automatic 
    tape cartridge loader on the TA90 and by means of support of the RV64 
    optical jukebox

oo   Menu interface for improved usability along with the standard DCL 
    interface

oo   Easy access to data on VAXcluster systems by means of the DECnet 
    networked systems

oo   Full on-line help and examples

oo   Controlled recycling of media based on user defined media pools

oo   Security features to protect against unauthorized use

oo   Vault/offsite management, reporting, and control

oo   Flexible report generation in addition to standard reports

oo   Round-robin device allocation

For flexibility in configuration, VAX SLS software is available as two 
separately licensed products:

VAX SLS

    The VAX SLS license allows all users on the node running VAX SLS 
    software to have access to the full functionality described above. The 
    node with VAX SLS software installed contains the master database and 
    the history file of all user data known to the VAX SLS software on this 
    particular node.

    Minimally, one VAX SLS license is required.  If a primary/secondary 
    node with automatic failover is desired, a second VAX SLS license is 
    required.

VAX SLS REMOTE

    The VAX SLS REMOTE license allows all users on a node running VAX SLS 
    REMOTE software to have access to the full functionality described 
    above when the VAX SLS REMOTE node is in communication with a node that 
    has VAX SLS software installed.

    The VAX SLS REMOTE software contains the history file of all user data 
    known to the VAX SLS REMOTE software on this remote node.  The node 
    running VAX SLS REMOTE communicates by means of the DECnet software to 
    the specified server node running VAX SLS software that contains the 
    master database.  This master database  supplies  information  about 
    volume location, pool authorization, and primary/secondary failover.

    Any number of nodes running VAX SLS REMOTE can be added to a VAX SLS 
    primary or VAX SLS primary/secondary node configuration.  One VAX SLS 
    node is required for any number of VAX SLS REMOTE nodes.
