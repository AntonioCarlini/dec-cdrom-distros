PRODUCT NAME:  VAX PCL, Version 2.0              SPD 26.23.04

DESCRIPTION

The VAX PCL driver is an optional VMS software product that supports 
interprocessor communications via the PCL11 hardware option. The VAX PCL driver 
provides a message-oriented data communications capability between user 
software located in up to 16 processors linked into a local area network by the 
PCL11, multi-dropped parallel bus. 

A user-oriented message of variable length can be directed to any other single 
receiving node during each transmission transaction. Both VAX and PDP-11 
processors can be mixed on the same PCL11 local network. The VAX PCL driver is 
compatible with the PCL-11M driver for RSX-11M. 

The VAX PCL driver also supports interprocessor communication via the 
DECnet-VAX network software package (DECnet-VAX must be licensed separately). 
The PCL11 hardware and VAX PCL driver supports all of the features of 
DECnet-VAX except downline loading. Mixed networks of VAX and RSX-11M DECnet 
nodes may be implemented. VAX PCL is provided as source code only.

Features

^ Multi-point operating mode in which the PCL11 connects up to sixteen 
  nodes in a local area network.

^ Supports DECnet-VAX or user-implemented network management software.

^ A nonprivileged QIO interface to the PCL11 for using PCL11 as a raw 
  data channel.

^ Node attention conditions are transmitted through attention ASTs.

^ Full duplex operation.
