PRODUCT NAME: VAX Rdb/ELN, Version 2.2                            SPD 28.03.08
              (Relational Database Management System)

DESCRIPTION

VAX Rdb/ELN is a relational database management system designed for dedicated
applications on systems running in the VAXELN application environment.

VAX Rdb/ELN implements the DIGITAL Standard Relational Interface (DSRI). DSRI
is an architecture for relational database management systems, as well as a
standard calling mechanism that can be used for database creation and
population.  DSRI allows many applications running on any VAX or MicroVAX 
node in a DECnet network to access all other DSRI compliant databases in the 
network.  This capability along with a relational Data Manipulation 
Language (DML) provides the support that is needed for accessibility and 
compatibility between VAX Rdb/ELN and VAX Rdb/VMS applications. 

VAX Rdb/ELN applications are developed using the VAXELN Toolkit on a host VMS
system. The resulting bootable, VAXELN-based Rdb/ELN applications
are then moved to the VAXELN target system using disk media or an Ethernet
Local Area Network (LAN) link. The application program executes on the target
system as a dedicated database system. The network link to the host
development system can be  used for remote debugging. 

Users are expected to have the necessary hardware to provide both host
development and target execution environments. Rdb/ELN cannot be run in
the development environment other for than debugging purposes.  Debugging 
an application in this manner is not a feature of VAXELN, as VAXELN 
applications cannot run on VMS.

Features

Data Definition Language (DDL) Compiler (ERDL)

^  Defines databases, relations, views, fields, and indexes

^  Modifies definitions of fields and relations

^  Deletes definitions of relations, fields, views and indexes 

^  Restructures databases on-line, without unload/reload

^  Adds comments to definitions of relations, views, fields, and indexes

Data Manipulation Language (DML)

^  Uses block structured data manipulation statements, similar to VAX 
   DATATRIEVE

^  Performs standard data manipulation operations: store, retrieve, update, 
   and delete

^  Performs standard relational operations: select, join, and project

^  Can access multiple databases in the same program

^  Manipulates data using:

   -  Interactive DML statements in ERQL (Relational Query Language)

   -  Precompiled DML statements in VAXELN PASCAL and VAX C programs

   -  VAX DATATRIEVE from a VMS system with Rdb/VMS capability

^  Optimizes queries automatically using:

   -  Index selection on one or more fields in a relation

   -  Join order

   -  Join by sort/merge

   -  Multi-index selection

   -  Automatic elimination of duplicate records using the ``project'' feature

^  Performs atomic transactions completed by commit or rollback

Data Dictionary

^  Stores data definitions in the database file itself, in the form of 
   relations

^  Allows retrieval and modification of data definitions

Database Utilities

^  Provide Logical backup/restore

^  Conversion utility provides a standard backup format which, allows 
   a Data base to be restored to either a Rdb/VMS format or, an Rdb/ELN 
   format.

Relational Database Query Language (ERQL)

^  Supports all data manipulation operations: store, retrieve, update, and 
   delete

^  Provides on-line help

^  Executes in both development and target environments

Concurrency and Integrity Controls

^  Full concurrent access (storage, retrieval, update, and deletion) in a 
   multi-user environment

^  Concurrent access by multiple applications to the same database

^  Ability to trade off between high consistency and high concurrency for 
   each application

^  Ability to change from high consistency to high concurrency and back 
   within a program

Integrity

^  Rollback of failed transactions, both automatic and program-controlled

^  Validity checking at the field level, using a VALID IF clause in the field 
   definition

Languages

^  Precompiler support for VAXELN PASCAL and VAX C with use of a generic 
   precompiler

Physical Storage Characteristics

^  Each database is kept in a single file. Individual database files cannot 
   span multiple disk volumes.

Relation Structure

^  Duplicate records can be eliminated using the ``unique index'' feature

^  Ordering of fields on storage or retrieval is not required

Storage Structure

^  B-Tree indexes on relations

^  Periodic reorganization of database NOT required

Datatypes

^  ASCII text

^  Varying text

^  Date

^  Signed word (16-bit) integer

^  Signed longword (32-bit) integer

^  Signed quadword (64-bit) integer

^  Single precision floating point (F_floating)

^  Double precision floating point (G_floating)

^  Segmented strings for storing large amounts of unstructured data, such as 
   documents, voice, or graphics

Remote Database Access

Application programs developed to access VAX Rdb/ELN databases and running
under VAXELN on a given node in a DECnet network can: 

^  Access VAX Rdb/ELN databases on the same node

^  Access VAX Rdb/ELN or VAX Rdb/VMS databases on other nodes in the network

Application programs developed to access VAX Rdb/VMS databases and running
under VMS on a given node in a DECnet network can: 

^  Access VAX Rdb/VMS databases on the same node

^  Access VAX Rdb/ELN or VAX Rdb/VMS databases on other nodes in the network

Limits and Parameters

^  Maximum number of relations and views in a database: 32767

^  Maximum number of bytes in a record: 32767

^  Maximum index key size:  200 bytes

^  Maximum length of a database object name: 31 characters

^  Maximum size of database file: limited by physical device
