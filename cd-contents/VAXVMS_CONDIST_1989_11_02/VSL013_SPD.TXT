PRODUCT NAME: VAXlab Software Library, Version 1.3	SPD 28.30.03
              (Formerly LabStar)

DESCRIPTION

VAXlab Software Library (VSL) is a set of subroutine libraries for 
real-time data acquisition, scientific plotting, and data analysis on a 
Q-bus, VAXBI, or 2000-series VAX system. The subroutines are callable
from any VMS language that supports the VMS calling standard. 

The Laboratory Input/Output (LIO) real-time data acquisition
subroutines simplify polled I/O, interrupt-driven I/O, and direct
memory access (DMA) I/O between supported devices and computer memory.
The I/O requests can be queued or called synchronously. When called
synchronously, the calling program waits for completion of the
subroutine before continuing. 

Subroutines are included for setting the parameters of the real-time 
devices, performing the data transfers, and for queuing and dequeuing data 
buffers. 

Supported Real-time Devices

Q-bus Devices

^ AAV11-DA, AAV11-SA

^ ADQ32, ADQ32-SA

^ ADV11-DA, ADV11-SA

^ AXV11-C, AXV11-SA

^ DRQ3B, DRQ3B-SA

^ DRV11-J

^ DRV11-WA, DRV1W-SA

^ IEQ11, IEQ11-SA

^ KWV11-C, KWC11-SA

VAXBI Devices

^ DRB32 

^ DRB32W

UNIBUS Devices

No UNIBUS devices are supported.

Serial I/O

Serial I/O is supported on all Q-bus, VAXBI and 2000-series VAX
systems using the local serial ports or distributed over the Ethernet
using DECserver-series products. 

Supported pseudo devices include:

^ Dynamic memory allocation

^ Fast file input and output

^ Interprocess communication

^ Real-time Plotting (VAXstation monitors only)

In addition, the I/O subroutines have the capability to control the 
Preston Scientific GMAD-series analog input subsystem, when the GMAD 
is interfaced to the Q-bus via the DRQ3B or DRV11-WA parallel digital
module, and when interfaced to the VAXBI via the DRB32W parallel 
interface.

The Laboratory Signal Processing (LSP) subroutines perform data format
translation, fast Fourier transformations (FFT), signal filtering,
interval histogramming, and thermocouple voltage-to-temperature
conversions. Routines are included to calculate power spectra,
cross-correllations and auto-correllations, and phase angle and modulus
spectra. 

The Fourier transform routines handle both real and complex data in
one or two dimensions, in both the forward and inverse directions.
Filtering algorithms include simple polynomial filtering; first,
second and third derivative polynomial filtering; nonrecursive
filtering; and spectral windowing.

The Laboratory Graphics Package (LGP) plotting subroutines, based on
the GKS graphics standard, are used to plot mathematical data in the
form of 2-D, 3-D, histogram, and contour plots. Output can be directed
to a terminal or to a hardcopy device, and can be saved in disk files
for future use. Additional features include various contouring
options, iterative real-time plotting, and a host of plotting utility
subroutines. 

Supported graphics output devices:

^ HP7550 

^ LA12

^ LA34

^ LA50

^ LA75

^ LA100

^ LA210

^ LCG01

^ LJ250

^ LN03-PLUS

^ LN03R

^ LPS40

^ LVP16 (8 1/2 x 11)

^ LVP16 (11 x 17)

^ VAXstation 2000, VAXstation II, VAXstation II/GPX, VAXstation 3200,
  VAXstation 3500

^ VT125 

^ VT240

^ VT241

^ VT330

^ VT340

^ Tektronix 4014

^ Tektronix 4107

In addition, the user can add support for any foreign device for which a 
GKS handler exists.

Multiple plotting windows are supported on all terminals.

The Scientific Subroutines Package (SSP) subroutine library for
statistical and numerical analysis is included in VSL at no charge, as
unsupported software. Statistics subroutines perform mean and standard
deviation calculations, regressions, and analysis of variance and
covariance.  Numerical analysis routines do matrix operations and
integral calculations, find polynomial roots, and solve first order
differential equations. 

PEAK, a generalized subroutine for peak processing, is included as
unsupported software.

The Interactive Data Acquisition Tool (IDAT), allows the user to
acquire, plot, perform fast Fourier transforms, and store analog data
through a ready-to-use, forms-driven program. IDAT is ideal for
testing analog-to-digital, digital-to-analog converters, and digital
I/O interfaces, and for interactive applications which require only
synchronous data transfers. 

The Manager Utility, an interactive system management program, is
provided to help simplify many of the tasks normally associated with
system management. These tasks include adding user accounts,
allocating and mounting devices, defining and starting print and batch
queues, defining network nodes, and doing backup and restore of user
data. 

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

VAX, MicroVAX or VAXstation configuration as specified in the System Support 
Addendum (SSA 28.30.03-x).
