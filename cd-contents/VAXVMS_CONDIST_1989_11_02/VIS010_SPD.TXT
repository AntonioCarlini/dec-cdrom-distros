PRODUCT NAME:  VAXimage Application Services For VMS, 
               Version 1.0                                    SPD 25.E8.00

DESCRIPTION

VAXimage Application Services for VMS (VAS) provides application programmers
with software tools and utilities to facilitate the building of bitonal image
applications.  VAS provides run-time support for the image data type, as
well as a set of services to enable application development and system
integration.

VAS supports VMS DECwindows.  VAS complies with CCITT, Group III (1D and 2D) 
and Group IV (2D) (CCITT Standards T.4 and T.6) recommendations for bitonal 
(facsimile) image data compression schemes; the X Window System (tm) 
standard; and the PostScript (r) Language Reference industry standard.  
It also complies with DIGITAL's Imaging System Architecture (DISA), DIGITAL's 
Document Interchange Format (DDIF), and DIGITAL's Compound Document 
Architecture.

VAS provides library resident routines for scanning, viewing, printing, and
and manipulation of bitonal image data.  The routines are language independent
and include examples in BASIC, FORTRAN, and C.  These programmer productivity
tools offer a consistent interface that conforms to the VAX-11 Procedure
Calling and Condition Handling Standard.

VAS V1.0 supports the DIGITAL MD300 bitonal document image scanner.

Features 

Image Input Services (IIS) provides the device driver for the MD300 image 
scanner as well as the following callable services:

^ Reserve/release local or remote image input device

^ Get/set/reset device attributes

^ Read image data from the device, synchronously (local or remote) or 
  asynchronously (local only)

^ Read image data into an ISL image frame.

Image Services Library (ISL) provides integrated image data type support 
services, including:

^ Create/delete/copy an image frame in memory

^ Set/get image frame attributes

^ Import image data from bitmap or DDIF format

^ Export image data to bitmap, DDIF, PostScript@R, or sixel format

^ Encode using CCITT, Group-III (1D and 2D) and Group-IV (2D) (CCITT 
  T.4 and T.6) data compression schemes

^ Adjust image frame:

  - Rotate through any angle

  - Scale the image by any amount, independently, along the X and Y 
    axes

  - Define a rectangular region of interest within an image frame

  - Copy or extract the rectangular region of interest

  - Perform Boolean operations on a region of interest of an image bitmap

Image Display Services (IDS) provide rendition and presentation services 
for device independent image display for applications, including:

^ Services for display of images on DECwindows workstations and 
  supported hardcopy devices

^ DECwindows image widgets with scroll bars to render and display an 
  image or portion of an image and to interactively roam through the 
  image.

DCL IMAGE is a DCL command line interface to specific VAS services.  DCL
IMAGE commands include:

^ IMAGE SCAN allows scanning of an 8-1/2 x 11 page on the MD300 scanner 
  as well as control over these scanner features - brightness, 
  contrast, mode (halftone or line art), and resolution.

^ IMAGE RENDER converts a DDIF image file into a format suitable for 
  output.  It adjusts to the type and characteristics of the output
  device as well as its presentation level protocol.

^ IMAGE VIEW provides viewing a rendered image on a workstation 
  or sixel terminal

^ IMAGE ADJUST demonstrates rotating or reorienting the original image; 
  cropping or extracting a region of interest; and scaling 
  (enlarge/reduce) the original image.

^ IMAGE CONVERT provides conversion of the Microtek TM Eyestar file 
  format to DDIF format for inclusion in compound documents.

SOURCE CODE INFORMATION

Source code examples in VAX C, VAX BASIC, and VAX FORTRAN are provided to
show the programmer interface to VAXimage Application Services.

Language-specific files for definition of structures, flags, and 
constants needed to interface VAXimage Application Services are
provided.
									      
HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

VAX, MicroVAX or VAXstation configuration as specified in the System Support 
Addendum (SSA 25.E8.00-x).

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS *

VMS Operating System (And the necessary components of VMS DECwindows) 

VMS DECwindows is a part of the VMS Operating System but must be 
installed separately.  Installation of VMS DECwindows gives you the 
option to install any or all of the following three components:

^ VMS DECwindows Base Kit (Run-time support)

^ VMS DECwindows Device Support

^ VMS DECwindows Programming Support

For systems using terminal: (No DECwindows interface)

^ VMS DECwindows Base Kit

For workstations running DECwindows:

This product may run in either of the following ways:

^ Standalone execution - Running the X11 display server and the client 
  application on different machines

^ Remote execution - Running the X11 display server and the client 
  application on different machines

For standalone execution, the following DECwindows components must be 
installed on the machine:

^ VMS DECwindows Base Kit

^ VMS DECwindows Device Support

For remote execution, the following DECwindows components must be 
installed on the machines:

Server Machine                             Client Machine

VMS DECwindows Base Kit                    VMS DECwindows Base Kit
VMS DECwindows Device Support              VMS DECwindows Device Support

* Refer to the System Support Addendum for availability and required versions 
  of prerequisite/optional software (SSA 25.E8.00-x).
