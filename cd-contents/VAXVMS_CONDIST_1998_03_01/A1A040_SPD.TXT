 PRODUCT NAME:  DIGITAL Office Server for OpenVMS V4.0 SPD: 61.49.00

 DESCRIPTION

 DIGITAL[TM] Office Server for OpenVMS[TM] V4.0 builds upon the proven
 strengths of both ALL-IN-1[TM] and MailWorks[TM], delivering robust
 and scalable messaging services to a wide range of mail clients on a
 choice of server platforms, and communicating with a choice of mes-
 saging backbones. Key features include:

 o  New Administrator client moves day-to-day administration to a new
    graphical user interface (GUI) on Windows NT[TM] V4.0 and Windows
    95[R].

 o  Distributed File Cabinet, whereby users on their local system can
    access messages and documents of any type on remote systems as if
    they were local.

 o  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) support over TCP/IP
    enables access to the new generation of LDAP Directory Services be-
    coming prevalent on the Internet and intranets.

 o  Personal access to the Office Server File Cabinet from the Inter-
    net with logon and password authorization in conjunction with the
    new DIGITAL Office Server Web Interface V4.0 that installs on a lo-
    cal Internet Server. The ability to publish documents of any type
    for Public Access is retained.

 o  Multiple backbone support:

    -  X.400 via MAILbus[TM] 400 and DIGITAL X.500 on OpenVMS and UNIX[R]
       (including smtp/MIME gateway)

                                                           July 1997

                                                         AE-R5XMA-TE

    tion experienced by MailWorks customers

 o  Client Access Licensing

 o  Year 2000 ready

 o  Full ALL-IN-1 VT functionality retained for current ALL-IN-1 sys-
    tems

 o  One common kit for Alpha and VAX

 ALL-IN-1 customers upon upgrading to Office Server may retain their
 existing Capacity and User licenses, thereby eliminating any admin-
 istrative overhead. Access to all ALL-IN-1 V3.2 functionality such as
 WPS-PLUS[TM], Customization Management, Time Management, and Group Con-
 ferencing, if already activated, is fully retained with the instal-
 lation of Office Server V4.0.

 New customers and MailWorks customers will utilize Client Access Li-
 censing, which also grants the rights to deploy DIGITAL clients such
 as TeamLinks[TM] and the MAPI driver as well as access to all Office
 Server capabilities.

                                  2

 

 Office Server provides facilities for mixed groups of Windows NT, Win-
 dows 95, Microsoft[R] Windows[R] V3.11 and V3.1, Apple[R] Macintosh[R],
 and VT users in small departments or across the enterprise to commu-
 nicate, share documents, and work together to raise collective pro-
 ductivity.

 Through electronic mail and document sharing across wide area networks,
 users can collaborate on multimedia information that has been created
 on desktop, departmental, and corporate systems. In addition, due to
 Office Server's centralized server-based origins and comprehensive sys-
 tem management facilities, a minimum management staff is required.

 TeamLinks CLIENT SUPPORT

 Services available to TeamLinks Windows V2.5, V2.7, V3.0, and Macin-
 tosh V2.5, V2.6 clients:

 Office Server provides workgroup services to TeamLinks clients over
 TCP/IP, SLIP, DECnet[TM], asynchronous links or AppleTalk[R] (to Mac-
 intosh devices). The server enables TeamLinks users to gain access to
 the File Cabinet drawers, folders and documents, messaging service,
 distribution lists, and management functions with minimum retraining
 for VT users familiar with ALL-IN-1 and MailWorks.

 Users employing Windows and Macintosh desktops with their choice of
 personal productivity applications available for these platforms can
 transfer documents of any type (including multimedia documents) to the
 Office Server File Cabinet for secure storage, and send these docu-
 ments via the messaging service using existing distribution lists. In-
 tegral distributed document sharing enables TeamLinks users to access
 any type of document in remote Office Servers and ALL-IN-1 systems.

 Office Server V4.0 allows users of heterogeneous clients (Windows, Mac-
 intosh, VT) to coexist and fully participate in workgroup activities.






                                  3

 

 For full details of the facilities available from TeamLinks clients
 please refer to SPDs 63.25 (Windows) and 48.17 (Macintosh).

 Note: The level of client service can be extended beyond that offered
 by the TeamLinks V3.0 Client. A full complement of Application Pro-
 gramming Interfaces (APIs) is provided to the File Cabinet Server and
 AIDA Server for application developers.

 MAPI CLIENT SUPPORT

 Office Server provides messaging and collaboration services to Mes-
 saging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) enabled applications
 such as Outlook, Exchange, and Windows Messaging via the DIGITAL Of-
 fice Server MAPI Driver V4.0, supplied separately. DIGITAL MAPI Driver
 V1.0 for ALL-IN-1 is also supported, but is functionally less rich.
 Mail, directory, File Cabinet, group management, drag and drop, and
 document conversion operations are supported on 32-bit Windows NT V4.0
 workstations and Windows 95 PCs. For full details of the functional-
 ity offered refer to SPD 61.43.01, and 61.43.00 for V1.0.

 WORLD WIDE WEB ACCESS

 Users on the Internet or intranets can access their own personal draw-
 ers, folders, and documents, as well as any others to which they have
 been granted access, with user logon and password authorization via
 the DIGITAL Office Server Web Interface V4.0 supplied separately. Uti-
 lizing standard Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator[R] and Microsoft
 Internet Explorer from, for example, an Internet Café, messages and
 documents can be viewed and downloaded to the PC.

 In addition, any document placed in a drawer with World Read access
 or Internet access can be accessed from anywhere on the Internet (sub-
 ject to firewalls and any requisite tunneling software). No special-
 ized Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) authoring tool is required on
 the server to publish documents on the Internet, and updating docu-
 ments is simply a question of filing a new document in the File Cab-
 inet for immediate access from the Web. For further details refer to
 SPD 61.55.00.


                                  4

 

 Important: All documents within the Office Server File Cabinet can be
 made secure by the inherent security capabilities. However, if these
 facilities are not used correctly, access from Office Server to the
 Internet may open up the possibility of security violations. DIGITAL
 accepts no responsibility for the security of documents within DIGITAL
 Office Server.

 OFFICE SERVER ADMINISTRATOR CLIENT

 The Administrator client can be installed on Intel[R] and Alpha based
 Windows NT V4.0 workstations and Windows 95 Intel desktops. It pro-
 vides the system manager a graphical user interface to various admin-
 istrative tasks. Full VT based system management is also retained, en-
 compassing all the management capabilities inherited from ALL-IN-1 V3.2.

 The new Administrator GUI provides management in the following areas:

 o  User management

    -  Create account

    -  Modify account details

    -  Delete account

    -  Rename account

    -  Transfer user

 o  Server management

    -  Manage File Cabinet servers

    -  Manage AIDA servers

    -  Manage senders and fetchers

 o  Log management

 o  General system management

                                  5

 

 The Administrator client will attempt automatic reconnection to the
 management server in the event of an automatic restart following server
 failure.

 Note: The Administrator client requires IP transport and does not sup-
 port any version of DECnet.

 MESSAGING AND DIRECTORY SERVICES

 Office Server is able to communicate with a variety of message trans-
 fer agents (MTAs) and directory service agents (DSAs).

 MAILbus 400

 With the inclusion of the X/Open[TM] XAPI and XDS interface stubs, cus-
 tomers may choose X.400 Alpha-based (either OpenVMS or DIGITAL UNIX[TM])
 MAILbus 400 and prerequisite DIGITAL X.500 Directory Service Agents
 as their mail backbone, deploying MTAs and DSAs when and where they
 wish, with local or remote connection to Office Servers.

 The Message Router Migration Package V1.0 (QP-042) assists Message Router
 (MR) customers to migrate from MR to MAILbus 400 by including the MAIL-
 bus 400 Message Router Gateway (XMR) and MAILbus Directory Migration
 Toolkit (DMT) as well as the MAILbus 400 MTA and DSA. This package caters
 for the phased migration of up to thousands of users over an extended
 period of time.

 PMDF

 Another option is Innosoft's PMDF, which delivers an AlphaServer[TM]
 based smtp/MIME backbone, having direct access to Office Server's MRIF
 V2.0 interface, without the need for Message Router. PMDF can utilize
 a variety of directory services, including its own-PMDF-X.500/LDAP Server-
 as well as the Network profile, integral to Office Server. PMDF does
 not support Message Router's Distributed Directory Services (DDS).





                                  6

 

 LDAP

 Office Server supports Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP),
 enabling the utilization of increasingly popular LDAP directory ser-
 vices. The implementation within Office Server V4.0 enables the use
 of the VT client and integral Office Server management utilities to
 populate the following LDAP directories:

 o  PMDF-X.500/LDAP Server

 o  Netscape Directory Server V3.0

 Address lookups are also supported from TeamLinks, MAPI driver clients,
 VT, and Office Server management utilities.

 Message Router/MAILbus 1

 Customers may continue with Message Router for OpenVMS VAX, as the MRIF
 V2.0 interface is included. The Message Router OpenVMSmail Gateway al-
 lows Office Server users to exchange messages with users of the Open-
 VMS Personal Mail Utility. Refer to the Message Router for OpenVMS VAX
 Software Product Description (SPD 26.33).

 Message interchange with the Internet and intranets is possible from
 MAILbus 400, PMDF and Message Router. Internet style addressing is hon-
 ored by Office Server out-of-the-box.

 POP3 SERVER

 Post Office Protocol 3 is supported as standard within Office Server
 V4.0. Users access their Inbox folder from standard Internet mail clients
 such as Eudora and Netscape with user name and password authorization.
 Upon connection, the contents of the Inbox are downloaded to the client
 for offline processing. Upon reconnection, the processed mail is trans-
 ferred to a predefined "sendmail" server such as DIGITAL TCP/IP Ser-
 vices or MultiNet[R] for distribution. The Office Server POP3 Server
 offers a number of additional features including:

 o  The ability to access any personal Office Server folder or shared
    drawer, and download the contents to the client.

                                  7

 

 o  Honors the "delete/retain message on server" option. The status of
    messages left on the server can be configured.

 o  Conversion to text of WPS-PLUS (V4.2 and above) and WordPerfect[R]
    (V4.1 and above) messages and documents as they are transmitted to
    the client.

 o  Available on both OpenVMS Alpha and VAX.

 YEAR 2000 READY

 Office Server is Year 2000 ready. All dates are stored in OpenVMS 64-
 bit format or NBS format and the supported date range is 17th Novem-
 ber 1858 to 31st December 9999.

 Years entered as two digits are defaulted to the century of the cur-
 rent system date and stored as such. For example, a date string of 29-
 Apr-74 processed on 5th March 1998 will be stored as 29-Apr-1974, and
 on 5th March 2001 as 29-Apr-2074.

 Date searches across the millennium change will behave correctly as
 the complete date (and time) is stored.

 DISTRIBUTED FILE CABINET

 Distributed Sharing Option is included in Office Server as standard,
 enabling users on remote systems to access documents in nominated draw-
 ers and folders as if they were local to them.

 As multimedia documents of all types become larger and distribution
 lists longer, the ability to directly access information reduces the
 load on the messaging system, leading to an overall performance im-
 provement. Typically, groups of users would be notified of the exis-
 tence of a document in a local folder by a small mail message, which
 offers the individuals the choice of whether they wish to access it
 or not.




                                  8

 

 Users with appropriate privileges, administrators, and system managers
 are able to set up access lists and controls, ensuring that only au-
 thorized individuals and groups of users can gain access to documents
 and messages within specifically-defined drawers and folders.

 This capability is known within ALL-IN-1 as Distributed Sharing Op-
 tion (SPD: 36.97).

 MAILWORKS MIGRATION UTILITY

 Office Server V4.0 includes server-based migration tools to assist in
 the movement of MailWorks OpenVMS user data and the message store to
 Office Server. Customers may install Office Server in situ on their
 existing VAX and Alpha systems or on new Alpha systems and either copy
 the message store to Office Server format, requiring more disk, or re-
 name the message store without increase in disk usage. Copying the con-
 tent ensures that the original MailWorks environment is left unchanged.

 Note: It is strongly recommended that, as good management practice, a
 full MailWorks system backup is taken before migration to Office Server.

 The migration utility includes:

 o  A pre-migration check tool that reports on data relevant to the mi-
    gration and any conflicts that might arise.

 o  System manager-initiated migration of one or more users at the same
    time.

 o  The migration of user profiles, file cabinets, and Personal Address
    Books

 o  Preservation of the integrity of messages.

 Full instructions on migrating from MailWorks OpenVMS are included with
 the Office Server V4.0 kit.

 FILE CABINET/FILE CABINET MANAGEMENT

 The Office Server File Cabinet is a full multimedia file repository.
 Documents and messages of any type, such as HTML, Postscript[R], .DOC,
 .XLS, .PPT, MPP, JPEG, full motion video, audio, and ASCII, can all
 be stored in the File Cabinet.

 The File Cabinet offers fault tolerance in that in the event of a File
 Cabinet Server or AIDA Server failure, upon restart, automatic recon-
 nection to MAPI clients will be attempted. Such clients include Out-
 look, Exchange, and Windows Messaging.

 The File Cabinet adopts the sharing model whereby a message sent to
 multiple recipients on the local system is not copied to every recip-
 ient, but pointers are utilized allowing each recipient to read the
 one copy of the message. This offers two major advantages over the one
 copy for each recipient model - better performance and much reduced
 disk storage requirements.

 The File Cabinet is similar in function to a standard office filing
 cabinet with drawers containing documents contained within folders.
 Folders are in alphabetical order and documents within the folders are
 ordered by date and time of creation.

 Document information (such as title, date created, document number,
 author, keywords, and type) is maintained in the File Cabinet. Facil-
 ities are provided for the user to maintain and manage the contents
 of the File Cabinet. The user can print or delete more than one doc-
 ument at a time. Selection of the documents can be made with user-specified
 criteria.

 Documents (individual or by folder) can be refiled, cross-filed, or
 duplicated. Information such as title and associated keywords can be
 changed. When a document has multiple cross-filings within a single
 drawer, only one copy of the document body is stored, thereby mini-
 mizing storage space.

 Documents deleted by a user are filed in the WASTEBASKET folder un-
 til it is emptied.

                                 10

 

 The File Cabinet provides access to documents through a common mech-
 anism, regardless of the format of the documents. Support is provided
 as standard for document formats of virtually any type, including mul-
 timedia. In addition, all X.400 P2 attributes can be stored in the Of-
 fice Server File Cabinet.

 Document reservation allows each user to protect a document while it
 is undergoing a series of edits, in situ or remotely, preventing other
 users from modifying it until unreserved. While it is reserved, other
 users can read but not edit the document.

 The document handling model makes a clear distinction between revis-
 able and final form documents. The model provides clear separation of
 formatting and printing, so that formatting of documents can be per-
 formed separately from printing.

 Mail Janitor

 A mail janitor utility is incorporated in the base product. It allows
 the system manager to refile old messages from the READ and OUTBOX fold-
 ers to the user's WASTEBASKET folder. The manager can set the maxi-
 mum permitted age of messages in the READ and OUTBOX folders (default
 60 days) and a maximum number of messages to delete per folder. Pro-
 file and Policies options can set and override default actions for num-
 ber of messages and user length of absence.

 Checkmail

 This feature is used to check if the user has any unread or unsent mail
 in the default mail drawer before entering Office Server and will in-
 form the user if this is the case.









                                 11

 

 Shared Filing

 Users can create shared drawers to allow other users to read and edit
 shared documents. Access controls are provided so that the drawer owner
 can specify which users or named groups of users are allowed to ac-
 cess a drawer and the operations they are allowed to perform in it.
 Concurrence control ensures that certain actions are prohibited while
 a user is modifying a shared document. For example, while a user is
 editing a shared document, other users attempting to edit that doc-
 ument will be informed the document is in use.

 The Reservation feature enables users on clients such as Outlook, TeamLinks,
 or VT to reserve a document in the File Cabinet before uploading the
 document to the user's workstation, thereby indicating to all other
 users who have access to that document that the document is in the pro-
 cess of being modified. Anyone subsequently attempting to modify the
 document is informed that it is reserved by another individual and that
 only Read access is permitted. Only when the reserver returns the mod-
 ified document and removes the reservation can others access the doc-
 ument with more than Read access.

 Group Services

 Users with suitable profile settings can define a set of users as a
 group. Multiple groups can be defined. Groups can be assigned access
 privileges to shared documents or drawers. Members can be added to or
 deleted from a group, and associated access rights are automatically
 assigned or removed. Users can also check what groups they belong to.

 MAIL

 The following information is specific to Office Server VT client ac-
 cess, describing the functionality available. Many of these operations
 are accessible from TeamLinks and MAPI-enabled applications also. Please
 check the relevant SPD for a complete list of each product's capabil-
 ities.




                                 12

 

 The Electronic Messaging application provides a means of exchanging
 messages with other users. The user can create, edit, print, delete,
 read, send, answer, and forward messages. The message header (which
 contains addressee(s), subject, and mail classification) and the text
 of the message can be edited prior to being dispatched.

 When creating a message, the user specifies the addressee(s) to whom
 the message is to be sent. Optionally, any addressee(s) to receive copies
 or blind copies of the message may be included. In addition, users may
 specify an expiry date for each message sent, along with importance
 (low, normal, or high) and sensitivity (Not Sensitive, Company Con-
 fidential, Private, or Personal). To save time with addressing, the
 user can create personal distribution lists or nicknames (seen only
 by the user).

 Incoming messages can be forwarded, answered, or both. Answers can be
 directed to the sender only, or to all the recipients of the message.
 Senders can request confirmation that addressees have received the mes-
 sage, read it, or both. Priority for delivery of the message can be
 assigned as Express, First Class, or Second Class. The user can spec-
 ify that the sending of a message be deferred to a time chosen by the
 user.

 Messages appear to the user and are treated as documents. Office Server
 maintains folders for incoming, read, created, and sent messages. Once
 a message is sent, one copy of that message (per system or cluster)
 is shared by the sender and receiver(s) and cannot be edited. Messages
 can be refiled and cross-filed in the user's File Cabinet. Documents
 already in the File Cabinet can be sent to other users.

 The user can choose to have all incoming messages automatically for-
 warded to another user. Alternatively, the user can create a reply mes-
 sage that is sent in response to all incoming mail (for example, "I
 am out of the office until. . .").

 Shared filing within Electronic Messaging ensures that operations be-
 have correctly in shared and distributed environments. Mail operations
 always take place in the user's MAIN drawer, whatever the previous con-
 text.

                                 13

 

 An index of attachments to a message can be displayed and a set of op-
 tions is provided for printing or reading individual attachments. At-
 tachments can be filed as revisable text or as messages which can be
 forwarded.

 The Set Mail User (SMU) option allows a user to perform many mail op-
 erations on behalf of another user, such as a secretary for a manager.
 The Grant Mail Access (GMA) option lets users specify other users who
 may process their mail. The mail header displays both users' names when
 a mail message is sent by a user employing SMU.

 Addressing includes:

 o  Automatic recognition of Internet addresses

 o  Integral X.400 addressing support

 o  For backwards compatibility and minimum disruption for users, the
    continued support of Message Router style addressing, even when the
    mail backbone has been replaced with MAILbus 400

 o  The ability to create a distribution list using the list of addresses
    from a received message header

 o  Nickname support - long nicknames, manipulation of the long mail
    addresses common on messages sent or received via gateways to other
    mail systems, and the ability to create a nickname from the sender
    of a message

 DIRECTORIES

 The Directories subsystem provides access to, and maintenance of, di-
 rectories available to the user. The user can view a directory of tele-
 phone numbers and addresses which is maintained by the system manager.
 A directory of all the Office Server users can also be viewed.

 Facilities are provided for the user to maintain and view a personal
 telephone directory, nicknames, and distribution lists.

 With the adoption of MAILbus 400 as the mail backbone, directory ser-
 vices are provided by DIGITAL X.500. Please refer to SPD 40.77.

                                 14

 

 With the installation of X.500 or MAILbus Distributed Directory Ser-
 vice, Office Server provides the user with the ability to perform mail
 directory searches on defined criteria such as name, department, lo-
 cation, and organization.

 See also the section on LDAP support above.

 SYSTEM MANAGEMENT

 The System Management utilities accessible from VT supplement the ca-
 pabilities of the Administrator client GUI, and are used to perform
 routine maintenance, including:

 o  Scheduling and rescheduling of housekeeping procedures

 o  Management of printers

 o  Direct maintenance of NETWORK.DAT, X.500, LDAP, and DDS profiles

 o  Metering and quota management of the shared area

 A system manager can nominate a user as a system administrator to help
 with the management of:

 o  File Cabinet and AIDA servers in support of PC and Macintosh clients
    and other Office Server components

 o  User accounts (create, delete, move, rename)

 o  Mail system Sender/Fetcher processes and queue maintenance

 o  Document archiving

 o  System distribution lists

 o  Drawers, including the restriction of individual user drawer cre-
    ation

 o  Mail janitor functionality

 o  Suppressing the printing of distribution lists

 o  Scheduling housekeeping tasks

 o  Monitoring Office Server exception and information reports

                                 15

 

 o  Initiating Office Server shutdown

 Office Server administrators do not require OpenVMS system privileges.

 Office Server supplies a metering facility that enables system man-
 agers to collect data on resource usage within Office Server sessions
 for pre-defined events. Application developers can define and create
 their own additional meters. Meters record the number of times a me-
 ter is called, CPU usage, Direct I/O, Buffered I/O, and Page Faults.

 PRINTING

 The Printing facility provides users with the ability to specify where
 a document is to be printed, the number of copies, and the output for-
 mat. The output can be directed to any of the printers available to
 the Office Server user, to another document, or to the user's termi-
 nal. Printing and formatting is handled in the background, freeing the
 terminal for other actions when interaction with the print formatter
 is not needed.

 Printer level checking ensures the print destination supports the doc-
 ument's final form format.

 Print and LPS print options (LPS20, LPS40, PS17, PS32) can be spec-
 ified during a print operation. System-defined and user-defined print
 styles can be utilized for improved ease-of-use.

 Distribution List Print Suppression

 Suppression of the distribution list on reading and/or printing of a
 mail message is determined according to the user's current preferred
 settings.








                                 16

 

 JOB SERVICES

 Office Server provides users with the ability to perform operations
 on their jobs on print, batch, and server queues. Using the multiple
 select indexing capability, users can get information on jobs, delete
 them, edit their attributes, and restart currently-executing jobs.

 Management of queues and jobs can be performed within Office Server.
 Managers can assign one or more users to manage specific local queues
 and to requeue jobs to different queues.

 PROFILE

 Each Office Server user has a user profile that contains information
 pertaining to the user.

 The VT user can access and modify part of their user profile includ-
 ing full name, address, telephone number, department, and title. In
 addition, user preference information (such as work week and working
 hours, editing style, mail notification, and read receipt handling)
 can be modified.

 The Manager maintains information such as user privileges, default di-
 rectory, and form library access.

 INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT

 Office Server is designed to support multilingual operations. This sup-
 port is subject to availability of the specific translation. Office
 Server can be deployed in a multilingual network and can support mul-
 tilingual operations on a single system. However, all language kits,
 including U.S. English, must be the same version.

 DOCUMENT PROCESSING

 The Document Processing application enables VT and terminal emulation
 users to create, edit, print, delete, and read documents. The editor
 supplied with Office Server is EDT[TM].


                                 17

 

 DOCUMENT CONVERSION

 Office Server includes the following supported data types:

 o  Rich Text Format (RTF)

 o  WK1, WK3, DIF, MacWrite[R], DX[TM], WPL, PICT, WordPerfect

 o  PS - the final form PostScript document format

 Office Server allows all the data types to be read, with the excep-
 tion of PostScript. The CDA[TM] conversion function is used to con-
 vert to/from the above data types.

 Users can send and receive these document types in mail, store them
 in their File Cabinet, read, print, copy, and convert them. The qual-
 ity of formatting of the displayed data depends on the CDA facilities
 provided by the underlying OpenVMS system. Office Server uses the CDA
 character cell formatter, which gives improved results with correct
 formatting and the inclusion of externally-referenced files.

 Office Server attempts to print CDA documents in PostScript if the des-
 tination printer is capable of it; otherwise, Office Server converts
 the document to ASCII text before printing.

 If a user attempts to edit any CDA document using a standard editor,
 the normal handling results in a message telling the user that the doc-
 ument format is not supported by the editor. However, the user can con-
 vert a CDA document into a suitable format for editing, and then use
 the appropriate editor. Through conversion, there is a potential for
 formatting attributes to be lost.

 For conversions on Alpha, DECwindows[TM] V1.2 must be installed and
 the minimum version of CDA$ACCESS.EXE and DDIF$CC_VIEWSHR.EXE is V1.8.

 For conversions on VAX, CDA Converter Library V2.2 must be installed,
 which will also install CDA Run-Time Services V1.0. The minimum ver-
 sion of CDA$ACCESS.EXE and DDIF$CC_VIEWSHR.EXE is V1.7.


                                 18

 

 VT-SPECIFIC FUNCTIONALITY

 Office Server offers a VT interface to VT users moving from MailWorks
 OpenVMS. This interface supports electronic mail, file cabinet, and
 server-based printing operations.

 Note: DIGITAL acknowledges that a plethora of third-party PCs, PC BIOS,
 network interfaces and network software stacks can be deployed in con-
 junction with PCs and Macintosh computers accessing DIGITAL Office Server.
 DIGITAL has observed that some combinations of these third-party prod-
 ucts do not exhibit correct behavior, resulting in intermittent or per-
 manent user- or system manager-perceived problems. If such conditions
 occur, DIGITAL reserves the right to recommend combinations of the above

                                 22

 

 that are known to behave correctly to solve actual customer interop-
 erability problems. In addition, DIGITAL will not be held responsi-
 ble for supporting combinations of third-party products used in con-
 junction with Office Server that are known to behave improperly or to
 consistently exhibit incorrect operation on customer sites.

 DISK SPACE REQUIREMENTS

 LICENSING

 DIGITAL Office Server V4.0 supports two mutually exclusive styles of
 licensing:

 o  For customers upgrading from ALL-IN-1, traditional Capacity and User
    (Concurrent and Personal) licensing continues to be supported, en-
    suring that customers experience no changes to the way they are cur-
    rently licensed; thereby eliminating any administrative overhead.
    ALL-IN-1, which is Year 2000 ready, will remain in the price book,
    and existing traditional licenses will continue to be orderable.

 o  For new deployments of Office Server, and for MailWorks customers
    evolving to Office Server, Client Access Licensing (CAL) is manda-
    tory. The Unique Product Identifier (UPI) for the Office Server CAL
    is 5TD.

 Client Access Licensing

 Client Access Licensing has the financial advantage of granting to one
 user the rights to access the Office Server system and DIGITAL clients
 in the one license. For example, one CAL would enable a user to ac-
 cess the Office Server capabilities from a DIGITAL TeamLinks, DIGITAL
 MAPI Driver, or VT client without incurring the cost of the client soft-
 ware itself. If the client is developed by a third party however, the
 rights to install that client on the desktop must be purchased from
 the third party vendor, as the rights to third party software are not
 granted by the DIGITAL Office Server CAL.

 Without exception, one CAL must be acquired for every user featured
 in the Office Server profile; that is, at all times every registered
 user must be licensed by one CAL. CALs may be moved between systems
 as user populations fluctuate, but the number of CALs present on the
 site must equal or exceed the number of registered users at the site.

 Note: In OpenVMS clusters, traditional licensing and Client Access Li-
 censing cannot coexist. For example, one Office Server system licensed
 by CALs must not be added to an Office Server V4.0 cluster licensed
 by Capacity or User licenses.

                                 26

 

 Office Server System License

 In addition to CALs, each Office Server installation must be licensed
 by one Office Server (system) License (UPI is 5TB). For Office Server
 deployments on OpenVMS clusters, one system license (QM-5TB9A-AA) is
 required per OpenVMS system in the cluster.

 Each Office Server kit (QB-5TBAA-SA) includes the license, media, and
 documentation for Office Server, and the media, documentation, and li-
 cense to install one Office Server Administrator client (UPI is 5TC).
 Additional Administrator Clients may be installed upon the acquisi-
 tion of additional licenses (QM-5TC9A-AA).

 Customers with DIGITAL Service agreements

 All MailWorks and ALL-IN-1 customers paying for DIGITAL New Version
 Licensing Support agreements (NVLS) will receive the Office Server V4.0
 media, documentation, and licenses as part of their agreements. A Li-
 censing Information Sheet is included in this kit, explaining in de-
 tail the various licensing terms.

 Evolving to Office Server from MailWorks and ALL-IN-1

 MailWorks customers must replace their existing licenses with Office
 Server System licenses (QM-5TB9A-AA) and acquire one CAL (QM-5TD9A-
 A*) for every user/subscriber on each system. MailWorks customers on
 DIGITAL Service contract will receive 100 free CALs. For VAX systems
 with greater than 100 users, additional Upgrade CALs (QM-5TD9A-C*) must
 be purchased equal to the number of subscribers on the system at the
 time of migration. For Alpha systems, additional Upgrade CALs will be
 provided free-of-charge. In all cases, users added after the migra-
 tion must each be licensed by an additional CAL.

 ALL-IN-1 customers are obliged to retain their existing licenses, be
 they capacity or user-based. PAKs must remain installed during the in-
 stallation of Office Server V4.0, as LMF checks will continue.




                                 27

 

 Non-Service Paying Customers

 Customers without a DIGITAL support agreement should consult their DIGITAL
 or DIGITAL Partner account manager regarding upgrading to Office Server
 V4.0.
