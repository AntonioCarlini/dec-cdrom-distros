 DESCRIPTION

 ALL-IN-1 Office Server Options for OpenVMS AXP and OpenVMS 
 VAX V3.1 provides robust and scaleable services to Microsoft[R] 
 Windows[TM] and Apple[R] Macintosh[R] desktops - such as those 
 utilizing TeamLinks Clients - and timeshared VTs, with a number of 
 flexible licensing and migration options designed to maximise 
 customer choice. 

 It has a proven facility for integrating other business-oriented 
 applications and unifies applications and services into an easy-to-use 
 information system. It provides facilities for mixed groups of VT 
 and TeamLinks users in small departments or across the enterprise
 to communicate, share documents and work together to raise collective
 productivity.
 
 Through ALL-IN-1 electronic mail and links into Digital Equipment Cor-
 poration's networking facilities and de facto industry standard
 networks such as TCP/IP, users can transport or receive multi-media 
 information that has been created on desktop, departmental and 
 corporate systems. In addition, due to its server based origins and
 comprehensive system management facilities, a minimum management 
 staff is required.

 ALL-IN-1 Office Server consists of:

 o  ALL-IN-1 Office Applications

 o  Integral Support for TeamLinks Windows and Macintosh Clients
 
 o  Multiple Licensing Options and Licensing Styles

 o  Message Router Gateway for OpenVMS VAX (includes both the Message 
    Router and the Gateway to OpenVMS Personal Mail Utility)

 o  VAX FMS (includes both FMS and Forms Language Translator)

 o  ALL-IN-1 Group Conferencing (based on DEC Notes)

 o  Integral CDA Conversion Service


 ALL-IN-1 provides an environment in which users access applications
 in a consistent manner. A user's documents are stored in the File Cab-
 inet where they are accessed from the office applications.

 The generic office applications are built upon the base system facil-
 ities. These facilities are available when customizing or developing
 applications that are to be consistent with the ALL-IN-1 environment.

 
 LICENSING OPTIONS

 Sub-systems of ALL-IN-1 are now available packaged in a number of 
 licensing options all from the same kit. These options are designed 
 to enable customers to optimise their purchases to suit end-user 
 needs. All licensing options support Concurrent Use, Tier Capacity 
 and Personal Use licensing styles.

 * support is provided for one system manager only. Additional 
   system administration personnel can be granted access however, 
   each requiring a Personal Use license from any of the other 
   licensing options. Concurrent Use licenses for system management
   purposes are not recommended.

 Note: 

 o The ALL-IN-1 Client Services Access License is limited to the 
   current capabilities of the TeamLinks V2.* Client (Windows and 
   Macintosh). Subsequent versions of the TeamLinks Client are planned
   providing greater access to ALL-IN-1 services.

 o The Client Services Access license does not support User access from 
   VTs or terminal emulation mode UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. For 
   capabilities greater than those accessible from TeamLinks V2.1 
   Clients choose the full ALL-IN-1 IOS (Integrated Office Server) 
   license, the ALL-IN-1 Core Services license or the ALL-IN-1 STARTER 
   license as appropriate.

 o Every TeamLinks client must be licensed by a TeamLinks V2.1 or V2.0
   Client license regardless of the ALL-IN-1 licensing option being 
   accessed.


 TeamLinks CLIENT SUPPORT
 
 Services available to TeamLinks V2.0 and V2.1 Clients

 The ALL-IN-1 Office Server provides ALL-IN-1 workgroup services to
 TeamLinks V2.0 and V2.1 Clients over DECnet, TCP/IP, Asynchronous links
 or Appletalk (to Macintosh devices). The server enables TeamLinks users 
 to gain access to the file cabinet drawers, folders and documents, 
 messaging service, and distribution lists with minimum retraining for 
 VT users familiar with ALL-IN-1.

 Users employing Windows and Macintosh desktops with their choice of 
 personal productivity applications available for these platforms can 
 transfer document types of any description to the ALL-IN-1
 File Cabinet for secure storage and send these multi-media documents 
 via the messaging service using existing distribution lists. 

 ALL-IN-1 Office Server V3.1 allows users of heterogeneous clients 
 (Windows, Macintosh, VT, DOS) to co-exist and fully participate in 
 workgroup activities. 

 It is recommended that TeamLinks for Microsoft Windows V2.0
 Clients be updated to TeamLinks V2.1 to gain access to more
 functionality and higher performance.

 OFFICE APPLICATIONS available in the ALL-IN-1 Office Server V3.1

 File Cabinet/File Cabinet Management

 The ALL-IN-1 File Cabinet is similar in function to a standard office
 filing cabinet with drawers consisting of documents contained within 
 folders. Folders are in alphabetical order and documents within the 
 folders are in order by date and time of creation. The latest document 
 is listed first, except for the INBOX where the latest document is 
 listed last.

 Document information (such as title, date created, document number,
 author, keywords, and type) is maintained in the File Cabinet. Facil-
 ities are provided for the user to maintain and manage the contents
 of the File Cabinet. The user can print or delete more than one 
 document at a time. Selection of the documents can be made with 
 user-specified criteria.

 Documents (individual or by folder) can be refiled, cross-filed, or
 duplicated. Information such as title and associated keywords can be
 changed. When a document has multiple cross-filings within a single
 folder, only one copy of the document body is stored.

 Documents deleted by a user are filed in the Wastebasket until the 
 Wastebasket is emptied.

 A Scratch Pad facility is provided where parts of documents or con-
 tents of the user's screen can be temporarily placed. Contents of the
 scratch pad can be inserted into a document, edited, printed, mailed,
 or read.

 The File Cabinet provides access to documents through a common mech-
 anism regardless of the format of the documents. Support is provided
 as standard for document formats of any type including multi-media.
 In addition, all X.400 (1984) P2 attributes can be stored in the 
 ALL-IN-1 V3.1 File Cabinet and sent between ALL-IN-1 Office Server and 
 MAILbus400 Message Transfer Agent for OpenVMS VAX, OpenVMS Alpha AXP, 
 OSF/1[R] Alpha AXP, and ULTRIX systems over DECnet OSI Phase V through
 the XMR (OpenVMS VAX) gateway.

 ALL-IN-1 provides a feature that allows the user and system manager
 to archive/restore any ALL-IN-1 document from the shared areas or from
 a user's File Cabinet. Archiving of the same document by multiple users
 will result in multiple copies of that document being archived.

 Mail Janitor

 The Mail Janitor Utility (MJU) ASSETS functionality is incorporated in the 
 base product. It allows the system manager to refile old messages in 
 the READ and OUTBOX folders to the user's WASTEBASKET. The manager can 
 set the maximum permitted age of messages in the READ and OUTBOX folders 
 (default 60 days) and a maximum number of messages to delete per folder. 
 Profile and Policies options can set and override default actions for 
 number of messages and user length of absence.

 Checkmail

 The functionality of the Checkmail ASSETS package is incorporated into 
 the base product. This feature is used to check if the user has any 
 unread or unsent mail in the default mail drawer before entering 
 ALL-IN-1 and will inform the user if this is the case.

 Shared Filing

 Users can create shared drawers to allow other users to read and edit
 shared documents. Access controls are provided so that the drawer owner
 can specify which users or named groups of users are allowed to access 
 a drawer and the operations they are allowed to perform in it. 
 Concurrency control ensures that certain actions are prohibited while a 
 user is modifying a shared document. For example, while a user is editing 
 a shared document, other users attempting to edit that document will be 
 informed the document is in use and who is editing the document.

 The Reservation feature enables a VT or TeamLinks user to reserve a 
 document in the File Cabinet before uploading the document to the user's
 PC or Mac, thereby indicating to all other users who have access to
 that document that the document is in the process of being modified.
 Anyone subsequently attempting to modify the document is informed that
 it is reserved by another individual with a timestamp and that only 
 Read Access is permitted. Only when the reserver returns the modified 
 document and removes the Reservation, can others access the document 
 with more than Read Access.

 Shared Filing links all users' File Cabinets on a system or across sys-
 tems via the ALL-IN-1 Distributed Sharing Option. Refer to the ALL-IN-1
 Distributed Sharing Option Software Product Description (SPD 36.79.xx).

 Group Services

 Users can define a set of users as a Group and use it as a distribution
 list. Multiple Groups can be defined. Groups can be assigned access 
 privileges to shared documents or drawers. Members can be added or 
 deleted from a group and associated access rights are automatically 
 assigned or removed. Users can also check what Groups they belong to.
 TeamLinks V2.* users can currently just use List Groups and List Members 
 only.


 MAIL

 The Electronic Messaging application provides a means of exchanging
 messages with other users. The user can create, edit, print, delete,
 read, send answer and forward messages. The message header (which 
 contains addressee(s), subject and mail classification) and the text 
 of the message can be edited.

 When creating a message, the user specifies the addressee(s) to whom
 the message is to be sent. Optionally, any addressee(s) to receive
 copies of the message and blind carbon copies of the message may be
 included. In addition users may specify an Expiry Date for each message
 sent along with Importance (high or otherwise) and Sensitivity (e.g.
 Company Confidential, Private, Personal). To save time with addressing, 
 the user can create personal distribution lists or nicknames (seen only 
 by the user).

 Incoming messages can be forwarded and/or answered. Answers can be di-
 rected to the sender only, or to all the recipients of the message.
 Confirmation that the addressee(s) has received and/or read the mes-
 sage can be requested. Priority for delivery of the message can be as-
 signed as Express, First Class, or Second Class. The user can spec-
 ify that the sending of a message be deferred to a time chosen by the
 user.

 Messages appear and are treated as documents to the user. ALL-IN-1 main-
 tains folders for incoming, read, created, and sent messages. Once a
 message is sent, one copy of that message is shared (per system or clus-
 ter) by the sender and receiver(s) and cannot be edited. Messages can
 be refiled and cross-filed in the user's File Cabinet. Documents al-
 ready in the File Cabinet can be sent to other users.

 The user can choose to have all incoming messages automatically for-
 warded to another user. Alternatively, the user can create a reply mes-
 sage that is sent in response to all incoming mail (for example, "I
 am out of the office until. . .").

 Shared Filing within Electronic Messaging ensures that operations be-
 have correctly in shared and distributed environments. Mail Operations
 always take place in the user's MAIN drawer, whatever the previous con-
 text.

 An index of attachments to a message can be displayed and a set of op-
 tions is provided for printing or reading individual attachments. At-
 tachments can be filed as revisable text or as messages which can be
 answered or forwarded.

 The Set Mail User (SMU) Option allows a user to perform many mail op-
 erations on behalf of another user, such as a secretary for a manager.
 The Grant Mail Access (GMA) Option lets users specify other users who
 may process their mail. The mail header displays both users' names when
 a mail message is sent by a user employing SMU.

 Addressing includes user interface improvements; the ability to create 
 a distribution list using the list of addresses from a received Message 
 Header; nickname support - long nicknames, manipulation of the long mail 
 addresses common on messages sent or received via gateways to other mail 
 systems, and the ability to create a nickname from the sender of a message.

 Exchange of messages with ALL-IN-1 users on other systems in a DEC-
 net network is provided by Message Router for OpenVMS VAX. Message Router
 OpenVMSmail Gateway allows ALL-IN-1 users to exchange messages with
 users of the OpenVMS Personal Mail Utility. Refer to the VAX Message
 Router for OpenVMS VAX Software Product Description (SPD 26.33.xx).

 In addition, all X.400 (1984) P2 attributes can be stored in the 
 ALL-IN-1 V3.1 File Cabinet and sent between ALL-IN-1 Office Server and 
 MAILbus400 Message Transfer Agent for OpenVMS VAX, OpenVMS Alpha AXP, 
 OSF/1[R] Alpha AXP and ULTRIX systems over DECnet OSI Phase V via the
 XMR gateway (OpenVMS VAX).


 DIRECTORIES

 The Directories subsystem provides access and maintenance to direc-
 tories available to the user. The user can view a directory, maintained
 by the system manager, that contains telephone numbers and addresses.
 A directory of all the ALL-IN-1 users can also be viewed. Facil-
 ities are provided for the user to maintain and view a personal tele-
 phone directory, nicknames, and distribution lists.

 With the installation of MAILbus Directory Service, ALL-IN-1 pro-
 vides the user with the ability to perform mail directory searches on
 defined criteria such as name, department, location, and organization.


 CUSTOMISATION AND APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT

 For VT users ALL-IN-1 supports a form-driven system that uses VAX FMS
 (Forms Management System) or DEC FMS on the Alpha AXP architecture. For 
 more information on VAX FMS refer to SPD 26.10.xx and DEC FMS 
 SPD 45.06.xx [Note: FMS is not relevant to TeamLinks V2.* users.]

 In conjunction with FMS and FMS Form Language Translator, the
 ALL-IN-1 Application Development utilities allow changes to be made
 to the ALL-IN-1 system. ALL-IN-1 can be altered to fit customer-specific
 requirements and provides a platform for application development and
 integration. ALL-IN-1 provides a programming interface to common func-
 tions and mechanisms to pass control from one application or function
 to another (i.e., Flow Control). 


 CUSTOMISATION MANAGEMENT (CM)

 Note: Not accessible from TeamLinks V2.0 and V2.1 Clients or the ALL-IN-1
	STARTER and Client Services Access licensing options.

 The features within Customization Management allow system managers and
 application programmers to modify their standard ALL-IN-1 system in
 a controlled and disciplined manner. It provides the ability to create, 
 modify, index, and control customizations as well as providing a 
 modification history record for each customization.

 Customization Management provides support for customizable element types 
 that ship with ALL-IN-1, as well as support for customer's own 
 element types.

 Support for customized corporate systems is provided through the use of 
 application areas. In addition, transferring customizations and 
 applications from one system to another is supported.

 Context-sensitive menu options are available, which allow the display
 and choice of only those menu options relevant to a particular ele-
 ment type.



 SYSTEM MANAGEMENT (SM)

 Note: Not accessible from TeamLinks V2.0 and V2.1 Clients.

 The System Management utilities are used to perform routine mainte-
 nance of ALL-IN-1, such as scheduling and rescheduling of housekeep-
 ing procedures, management of printers, direct maintenance of network
 and DDS profiles, metering, and quota management of the shared area.
 A system manager has the option of creating a non-OpenVMS privileged
 system administrator for the purpose of administering the management
 of the following: 

 o File Cabinet and Distributed Access Servers in support of TeamLinks 
   Clients and other ALL-IN-1 components

 o user accounts (create, delete, move, rename)

 o mail system Sender/Fetcher processes and queue maintenance

 o document archiving

 o system distribution lists
 
 o drawers, including individual user drawer creation restriction

 o Mail Janitor

 o distribution list print suppression

 o scheduling of housekeeping tasks
 
 o monitoring of ALL-IN-1 exception and information reports

 o and the initiation of ALL-IN-1 shutdown.

 ALL-IN-1 supplies a metering facility that enables system managers
 to collect data on resource usage within ALL-IN-1 sessions for 
 pre-defined events. Application developers can define and create their 
 own additional meters. Meters will record the number of times a meter 
 is called, CPU usage, Direct I/O, Buffered I/O, and Page Faults. Metered
 events can also be collected by DECtrace, if it is installed on the
 system. This provides facilities for managing and reporting the 
 information collected.

 Note: Utility Accounts will be removed in the next release of ALL-IN-1.

 PRINTING

 The Printing facility provides the user the ability to specify where
 a document is to be printed, the number of copies, and the output for-
 mat. The output can be directed to any of the printers available to
 the ALL-IN-1 user, another document, or to the user's terminal.
 Documents that specify Runoff handling are automatically processed by
 Digital Standard Runoff (DSR) before output. Printing and formatting 
 is handled in the background, freeing the terminal for other actions 
 when interaction with the print formatter is not needed.

 Printer level checking ensures the print destination supports the doc-
 ument's final form format.

 Print and LPS print options (LPS20 and LPS40) can be specified dur-
 ing a print operation. System-defined and user-defined print styles
 can be utilized for improved ease-of-use. Throughput of jobs during
 a multiple print operation has been improved.

 Distribution List Print Suppression

 Suppression of the distribution list on reading and/or printing of a mail
 message is determined according to the user's current preferred settings.


 JOB SERVICES

 Note: Not available from TeamLinks V2.0 and V2.1 Clients.

 ALL-IN-1 provides users the ability to perform operations on their jobs
 in print, batch, and server queues. Using the multiple select index-
 ing capability, users can get information on jobs, delete jobs, edit
 their attributes, and restart currently executing jobs.

 Management of queues and jobs can be performed within ALL-IN-1.
 Managers can assign one or more users to manage specific local queues 
 and requeue jobs to different queues.


 PROFILE

 Each ALL-IN-1 user has a user profile that contains information per-
 taining to the user.

 The VT user can access and modify part of their user profile including
 full name, address, telephone number, department, and title. In ad-
 dition, user preference information (such as work week and working hours,
 editing style, mail notification, and read receipt handling) can be
 modified.

 The System Manager maintains information such as user privileges, de-
 fault directory, and form library access.

 Index Select

 In most instances, a user can create an index selection list by se-
 lecting or deselecting objects from the index. Operations (such as print,
 delete, cross-file, and so forth) can be performed on the list as if
 they were a single entity. An index menu lists the options available
 to the current selected index. Within an index, a VT or terminal
 emulation user can scroll either forward or backward.


 INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT

 ALL-IN-1 is designed to support multilingual operations. This support
 is subject to availability of the specific translation. ALL-IN-1 can 
 be deployed in a multilingual network and can support multilingual 
 operations on a single system. However, all language kits, including 
 U.S. English, must be the same version.


 DOCUMENT PROCESSING

 Note: The license to use the WPS-PLUS editor is not included in the 
 ALL-IN-1 Core Services License or the Client Services Access License, 
 however existing WPS-PLUS documents can be read, formatted and printed; 
 only the capability to create new WPS-PLUS documents is unavailable.

 The Document Processing application enables VT and terminal emulation
 users to create, edit, print, delete, and read documents. The editor
 used is dependent upon the user's preference indicated in the User 
 Profile. ALL-IN-1 users have a choice of editors: EDT, TPU, WPS, and 
 WPS-PLUS. TeamLinks users may utilise any wordprocessor supported by
 their particular client such as WordPerfect, Ami Pro or Word and be 
 able to store documents so produced in the ALL-IN-1 File Cabinet.
 
 WPS-PLUS is not supported on Windows or Macintosh clients, however 
 a WPS-PLUS viewer is provided as standard.

 EDT, TPU, and WPS are ASCII editors. EDT and TPU use keying conven-
 tions and terminology oriented toward the more technical user. WPS uses
 keying conventions and terminology that make it a subset of WPS-PLUS.
 WPS is available to users who have a word processing orientation but
 desire ASCII output.

 The optionally installable WPS-PLUS V4.2 for ALL-IN-1 is Digital's full
 function word processor. This version significantly expands the 
 capabilities of WPS-PLUS by providing true proportional spacing, font
 selection, support for PostScript® output, multicolumn editor
 (up to 25 Left/Right margins within a ruler), the ability to create
 and/or edit up to 10 documents at one time. User enhancements include
 a more versatile status line, "Start" and "End" Control Blocks inserted
 together with a single keystroke, and many more.

 Highlights of WPS-PLUS are:

 o  Previewer for VT users and available as an application to TeamLinks
    users

 o  LNE1 character set support

 o  Formatter From/To page type field (All, Physical, Single)

 o  Global search and replace offering prompt at first occurrence and
    case and rendition sensitivity

 o  Single line view mode

 o  Multicolumn mode "goto column" commands

 o  Spell checker with "Corrections" option

 o  Insert or Overstrike Mode

 o  User control of margins and tabs, including left-justified, right-
    justified, and decimal-aligned tabs

 o  Automatic Centering, Underlining, Bolding, Double Underscoring, Change
    Bars, and Redlining

 o  Technical Characters and Scientific Equations editing

 o  Support for Wide Documents, up to 256 characters

 o  Numbered Footnotes, Paragraph Numbering to nine levels, Automatic
    Table of Contents generation, Table of Authorities, and Word In-
    dexing

 o  Widow/Orphan control and No-break Blocks

 o  Column Cut and Paste

 o  List Processing and Sort to produce form letters and maintain mail-
    ing lists-background processing is supported

 o  Abbreviation and Library documents

 o  Two-dimensional Editor for creation of diagrams and equations


 TIME MANAGEMENT (TM)

 Note: Not licensed by the ALL-IN-1 STARTER, ALL-IN-1 Core Services 
       or the ALL-IN-1 Client Services Access License.

 An ALL-IN-1 VT User interface to Time Management, offers the facility
 to maintain a personal calendar of events.  An "Events at a Glance"
 screen gives the user an editable picture of the day's events, which
 makes it easy to make changes.  Likewise, the "Task at a Glance" screen
 gives the user an editable picture of open tasks.  These pictures are
 combined on an "Events and Tasks" screen where other Time Managament
 operations can be performed.
 
 Users can tailor Time Management and display only the screens and 
 options that are of interest to them.

 Users can schedule, reschedule, or cancel an event. In an event in-
 volving other attendees, Time Management uses the Electronic Messag-
 ing application to deliver meeting notifications and confirmations.
 Users can also reserve unavailable time on their calendars. An entry
 in the user's calendar can be marked confidential and other users can-
 not read the description of the entry. Recurring events can be sched-
 uled whereby an attendee's "Yes" reply schedules all occurrences of
 the meeting on the calendar.

 Time Management has the ability to perform a multinode scan. This scan
 will return a graph of potential attendees' free time prior to the schedul-
 ing of the meeting. It will scan both local and off-node calendars in
 real time.

 The Tasks facility is provided to track reminders, to-do lists, ac-
 tion items, and so forth. Tasks are not necessarily tied to a specific
 day or time of day. Tasks can be viewed by selection criteria such as
 open versus closed, a range of beginning dates, deadlines, and so forth.

 Note: The ALL-IN-1 Time Management user interface, meeting notification
	and confirmations are not supported by TeamLinks Windows or 
	Macintosh clients, however they are supported in terminal
	emulation mode.


 GROUP CONFERENCING

 Note: Not licensed by the ALL-IN-1 STARTER or ALL-IN-1 Client Services
       Access license.

 An ALL-IN-1 VT user interface has been applied to Digital's DEC Notes
 application to provide the Group Conferencing feature. This feature
 gives users the ability to communicate on a many-to-many basis while
 taking advantage of ALL-IN-1's ease of use. Application developers can
 benefit from DEC Notes being integrated at the API level in develop-
 ing business or professional-specific applications that can use this
 conferencing capability. For more information on DEC Notes refer to
 SPD 47.19.xx (OpenVMS Alpha AXP) and 27.06.xx (OpenVMS VAX).

 DEC Notes also supports a Windows interface through the TeamLinks
 Conferencing for Windows V1.2 (SPD 38.65.xx) and may be integrated 
 into TeamLinks Clients via the 'button bar'.


 DOCUMENT CONVERSION

 All licensing options include the following supported data types:

 o  DDIF - the standard CDA encoding format

 o  DOTS - the format for packing and transferring composite CDA 
    documents

 o  DTIF - the CDA encoding format for tables

 o  WK1, WK3, DIF, MACWrite, DX, WPL, PICT, WORD, WORDPERFECT and RTF

 o  PS - the final form PostScript document format

 ALL-IN-1 allows all the datatypes to be read, with the exception of 
 PostScript.

 Users will be able to send and receive these document types in mail,
 store them in their Filing Cabinet, read, print, copy, and convert them.
 The quality of formatting of the displayed data depends on the CDA fa-
 cilities provided by the underlying OpenVMS system. ALL-IN-1 uses the
 CDA character cell formatter, which gives improved results with cor-
 rect formatting and the inclusion of externally referenced files.

 ALL-IN-1 will attempt to print CDA documents in PostScript if the des-
 tination printer is capable of it; otherwise, ALL-IN-1 will convert
 the document to ASCII text before printing.

 The CDA conversion function will be used to convert to/from the above
 datatypes.

 If a user attempts to edit any CDA document using a standard editor,
 the normal handling will result in a message telling the user that the
 document format is not supported by the editor. However, the user can
 convert a CDA document into a suitable format for editing and then use
 the appropriate editor. Through conversion, there is a potential for
 formatting attributes to be lost.

 CDA Base Services supports the ALL-IN-1 File Cabinet, thus allowing
 documents live-linked by any CDA application. Users will also be able
 to unpack composite documents into the File Cabinet.

 Application programmers will have access to the CDA tools through the
 provision of API functions.

 For more information on CDA Runtime Services for OpenVMS refer to 
 SPD 37.26.xx. 

 In addition integration 'hook's are included in all licensing options
 for Keyword KEYpak[R] converters.


 COMMUNICATIONS (CXP+)

 The Communications application enables users to access other computer
 systems without needing to understand anything about communications
 technology.

 Entire communications sessions can be automated through the use of Control
 Documents. (Control Documents are standard ALL-IN-1 documents that contain
 a set of special commands.) Connection to other computer systems can be
 fully automated if autodial modems or hardwired connections are permitted.
 The asynchronous, non-DECnet connection is by means of an OpenVMS terminal
 port (RS232 type) and can be connected to any computer system supporting
 such terminal types. 

 Facilities are also provided to transfer files to and from a DECmate
 II, a DECmate III, OpenVMS, and in or out of the user's File Cabinet.

 Modems may now be connected to LAT Servers enabling access from multiple
 systems on the network.
 
 The autodial feature of the Communications application supports Hayes
 or 100% Hayes compatible modems. No commitment is made or implied to
 support any other modem types.


 Desk Calculator

 Note: TeamLinks Clients have access to standard Windows and 
 Macintosh accessories instead of these functions.

 The Desk Calculator enables the user to perform interactive calcula-
 tions and include the results in documents. Desk Calculator operates
 in two modes: Calculator and Formula. Formula mode is used for com-
 plicated formulas that combine trigonometric and arithmetic functions.
 Calculator Mode is used for simple arithmetic computations. The al-
 ternate keypad is operated the same way as a standard calculator.


 Systemwide Features (Valid for VT Users)

 Menu Navigation for VT and Terminal Emulation Users

 Applications are accessed through a hierarchy of menus. Experienced
 users can bypass menus in a simple manner.

 The user can interrupt their current activity to read a new mail mes-
 sage, display the current time, or to access Time Management, Direc-
 tories, Desk Calculator, and Scratch Pad.

 Users familiar with OpenVMS commands can have direct access to the com-
 mands without leaving ALL-IN-1 if they are authorised by the system 
 manager to do so.

 Two styles of user interface are provided. One interface uses menus
 similar to other ALL-IN-1 applications. The other interface (hard-copy
 mode) is utilized, for efficiency, mainly over dial-up lines. This mode
 does not display the full screen menu but displays the menu in a strip
 form.


 Help

 VT users can invoke Help for any part of ALL-IN-1 by pressing the
 Help key. The Help facility provides basic information on the func-
 tion in question without the user having to reference the documenta-
 tion.

 For TeamLinks users the standard F1 key provides Help in the Windows 
 environment and 'Balloon' Help in the Macintosh environment.


 On-line Training

 Note: Relevant to VT users only.

 VT users can learn how to use the system using the on-line training
 facilities. Training leads the user through sets of interactive screens
 and explains how the various features of ALL-IN-1 work.


 User-Defined Processes (Valid for VT users only)

 User-Defined Processes (UDPs) automate frequently repeated key 
 sequences by automatically recording keystrokes. There is no limit 
 to the number of UDPs or the number of keystrokes that can be stored 
 in a UDP. One UDP can invoke another UDP. 


 Document Handling

 Document Reservation allows each user to protect a document whilst it is
 undergoing a series of edits, in situ or remotely, preventing other users 
 from modifying it until unreserved. Whilst reserved other users can Read
 the document but not edit.
 
 The Document handling model makes a clear distinction between revis-
 able and final form documents. The model provides clear separation of
 formatting and printing, so that formatting of documents can be per-
 formed separately from printing.

 The background formatter provides CDA formatting, which enables CDA
 formatting to be performed in both foreground and background.

 Printer level checking ensures the print destination supports the doc-
 ument's final form. If the destination does not support the final form,
 then, where possible, the document is converted to a format that is
 supported, or the user will be advised to print to a different printer.


 IBM[R] 3270 Terminal Support

 ALL-IN-1 can run on the following IBM terminal keyboards on CUT mode
 terminals that are supported using the CMX04 option card in a DECserver
 550:

 o  122 Key Typewriter (native mode)

 o  122/104 Key Typewriter (emulation mode)

 o  102 Key Typewriter

 o  87 Key Typewriter

 The ALL-IN-1 Kit contains a 3270 keyboard Quick Reference Card 
 showing the ALL-IN-1 functions.

 Minimal Shutdown Upgrade from ALL-IN-1 V3.0 is also available allowing 
 ALL-IN-1 to remain running for the bulk of the upgrade, reducing down 
 time. This is also valid for ALL-IN-1 STARTER V3.0 customers when
 upgrading to ALL-IN-1 V3.1.

 At installation the full ALL-IN-1 kit is installed regardless of 
 licensing option required with the exception of the WPS-PLUS V4.2
 editor, which is not installed with the Core Services or Client
 Services Access license. 

 Digital Service option

 This software product will be installed by Digital at no additional
 charge if purchased concurrently with a Startup Service Package that
 includes installation service. Both the operating system and this 
 product must be installed concurrently.

 Only customers with experience in managing OpenVMS and ALL-IN-1 should
 attempt installation of this product. Digital recommends that all other
 customers purchase Digital's Installation Services. These services 
 provide for installation of the software product by an experienced 
 Digital Software Specialist.


 The CART (Conflict Checking and Resolution Tool)

 This tool is included as part of the installation procedures, but should
 be run prior to the upgrade to ALL-IN-1 V3.1. It examines the customisa-
 tions on the existing system and produces the CART Report indicating
 what changes are required to migrate applications and customisations.
 It contains a number of procedures which check for changed messages, 
 mandatory changes, and a checklist generated from the Differences 
 document. 

 Upgrading from previous versions and co-existent versions

 Customers may only upgrade from ALL-IN-1 V3.0, V3.0A or STARTER V3.0
 systems to V3.1, upgrading from earlier versions than V3.0 is not 
 supported. 

 ALL-IN-1 V3.1 does not support co-existent systems i.e. earlier 
 versions of ALL-IN-1 and ALL-IN-1 V3.1 may not co-reside on the same 
 CPU, VAXcluster or VMScluster.

 Processor Restrictions

 ALL-IN-1 does not support diskless satellite systems in Ethernet and
 mixed interconnect clusters.

 The amount of memory, processors, and disk drives required by the sup-
 ported CPUs to run ALL-IN-1 is dependent on the number of simultane-
 ous users. This information is being updated on a continuing basis.
 Contact your local Digital office for specific details.

                ________________________ Note ________________________

                If you do not install WPS-PLUS with ALL-IN-1 Version
                3.1, you can:

                o  Decrease the disk space requirement on the
                   language disk by 2000 blocks.

                o  Decrease the disk space in the shared library
                   area by 3000 blocks.

                If you choose to integrate WPS-PLUS without the
                associated PostScript files, you can decrease
                the disk space in the shared library area by 2000
                blocks.

        Upgrade Installation: Disk Space for ALL-IN-1 Areas

              The disk space requirements for upgrading ALL-IN-1 areas on 
	      the system and target disks. This applies to upgrades from 
	      ALL-IN-1 Version 3.0 and ALL-IN-1 STARTER Version 3.0.

              The disk space requirements given are those used during
              the installation. The permanent space used when the
              installation has completed may be slightly less.

              The values given in the table assume that you choose to
              purge files during the installation. If you choose not to
              purge replaced files, you must use the values for a full
              installation.

 GROWTH CONSIDERATIONS

 The minimum hardware/software requirements for any future version of
 this product may be different from the requirements for the current
 version.


 LICENSING - MIGRATION to OpenVMS Alpha AXP

 In addition to the four licensing options (IOS, STARTER, Core Services
 and Client Services Access) available from the one kit, new licenses 
 are also available enabling migration from traditional IOS and STARTER
 licenses on ALL-IN-1 VAX to the newer licenses on ALL-IN-1 AXP. 

 Customers with full ALL-IN-1 IOS for OpenVMS VAX V3.0 can migrate to 
 ALL-IN-1 Core Services or ALL-IN-1 Client Services Access on Open VMS 
 AXP, if these options better suit the needs of the organisation.
 These two migration paths are valid for systems that are currently
 licensed on a Capacity or Personal Use basis. The same migration options 
 apply to existing ALL-IN-1 STARTER for OpenVMS VAX V3.0 systems.

 Note: These migration options do not apply between ALL-IN-1 VAX V3.0
   	systems and ALL-IN-1 VAX V3.1 systems.


 Trade-Up-To-User programme on ALL-IN-1 VAX and ALL-IN-1 AXP

 Existing Capacity based VAX V3.0 systems can convert to User licensing
 via the Trade-Up-To-User field programme and then deploy the resulting
 Personal or Concurrent licenses on any ALL-IN-1 V3.0 VAX or V3.1 VAX 
 or V3.1 AXP system in the organisation. These User licenses have the 
 same Unique Product Identifier (UPI) and corporate list price on VAX 
 and AXP systems and can therefore be deployed at will. 
 
 Note: Concurrent Use(r) licenses cannot be installed on ALL-IN-1 systems 
 prior to V3.1.

 The existing ALL-IN-1 STARTER VAX migration to full ALL-IN-1 IOS 
 VAX is also retained (UPI=VNP) for V3.1 systems. For customers that 
 only have access to ALL-IN-1 STARTER V2.4 systems they must first 
 upgrade to full ALL-IN-1 IOS VAX V3.0 before a transition to any
 of the licensing options available on either VAX V3.1 or Alpha AXP 
 V3.1. A temporary license PAK will be supplied free of charge to
 customers in countries where ALL-IN-1 STARTER V3.0 is not available. 
 This will enable them to install full ALL-IN-1 IOS VAX V3.0 and then 
 be in a position to move to any of the available options on either 
 VAX V3.1 or Alpha AXP V3.1.

    user. Upon acquiring a new Personal Use or Concurrent Use license
    of any type a new TeamLinks user must be registered as such by
    the ALL-IN-1 system manager or administrator. If no individual 
    TeamLinks named user registration occurs, that user will be denied 
    access to ALL-IN-1 V3.1

 o  Non-TeamLinks Clients accessing ALL-IN-1 via the published APIs 
    must also be registered OpenVMS and ALL-IN-1 users.
