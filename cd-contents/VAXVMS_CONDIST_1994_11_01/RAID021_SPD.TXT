PRODUCT NAME:  StorageWorks RAID Software              SPD 46.49.02
for OpenVMS, Version 2.1

DESCRIPTION

StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS is a software product that uses
RAID technology to manage groups of disk drives as arrays. The prod-
uct supports RAID Level 0 arrays for enhanced I/O performance and RAID
Level 5 arrays for enhanced data availability on both VAX and AXP plat-
forms. Both single-host systems and VMScluster systems are supported.

StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS Capabilities and Features

StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS manages groups of between 1 and
8 physical disks (between 3 and 8 for RAID Level 5) as arrays. Each
array can be partitioned into between 1 and 64 virtual disks. Appli-
cations use a virtual disk as if it were a physical disk.

A total of 20 such arrays per VMScluster system are supported, in any
mixture of RAID Level 0 and RAID Level 5.

StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS is a VMScluster product. Its
virtual disks may be accessed directly from any member of a VMSclus-
ter system for which a valid license is in effect. (All VMScluster sys-
tems may access virtual disks created using the Storage Concurrent Use
license QL-0MGAA-3B.) Virtual disks may not be MSCP served.

The disks in a StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS array may be of
different types, although disks of a single type are recommended for
consistent performance and optimal use of storage capacity. Both lo-
cal and MSCP served disks are supported.

for OpenVMS, Version 2.1

StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS virtual disks may not be used
to boot the OpenVMS Operating System, nor may they serve as VMSclus-
ter quorum disks They may, however, contain OpenVMS page and swap files.

StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS may be used in conjunction with
OpenVMS Volume Shadowing (Phase II only). OpenVMS shadow sets may be
StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS array members (RAID Level 0 only),
however, virtual disks may not be members of OpenVMS shadow sets.

A RAID Level 0 array whose members are shadow sets is a high perfor-
mance, high data availability storage solution for most applications.
Single-member shadow sets may also be used as RAID array members so
that the VAXsimPLUS autocopy feature may be employed as a failure pro-
tection mechanism.

Features Applicable to RAID Level 0 Arrays

The usable capacity of RAID Level 0 array is approximately given by:

Usable Capacity = N * 0.99 * CS
Where N is the number of physical disks in the array.
CS is the storage capacity of the smallest disk in the array.

The purpose of RAID Level 0 technology is to provide I/O intensive ap-
plications with greater I/O performance from a given I/O hardware con-
figuration than would normally be achieved by using the disks as in-
dividual volumes. Depending on the application, enhanced I/O perfor-
mance may be delivered as:

o  more I/O requests serviced per unit time due to probabilistic load
   balancing, or

o  higher data transfer rate due to concurrent transfer of data to or
   from more than one disk to satisfy a single request.

for OpenVMS, Version 2.1

Features Applicable to RAID Level 5 Arrays

The usable capacity of RAID Level 5 array is approximately given by:

Usable Capacity = (N-1) * 0.99 * CS
Where N is the number of physical disks in the array.
CS is the capacity of the smallest disk in the array.

StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS protects against loss of data
and loss of data accessibility due to the failure of any single disk
in a RAID Level 5 array. If a disk in a RAID Level 5 array fails, Stor-
ageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS provides continued service to ap-
plications by regenerating the failed disk's data using information
from the array's remaining disks. (For full protection against loss
of data availability due to single hardware failures, StorageWorks RAID
Software for OpenVMS software can be used in conjunction with redun-
dant hardware and supporting software throughout the system.)

While a RAID Level 5 array is reduced by a failed disk, data can be
read and written, but no redundancy is provided. A second disk fail-
ure while an array is reduced prevents application access to the data
stored on the array, and may result in data loss.

StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS reconstructs the contents of
a failed disk if a replacement disk is assigned to it. Reconstruction
does not interrupt application access to data on the array, although
performance may be affected. Replacement disks may either be assigned
to StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS by the storage administra-
tor (using a DCL command) or they may be placed in a spareset asso-
ciated with one or more RAID Level 5 arrays. If a disk in a RAID Level
5 array with an associated spareset fails, StorageWorks RAID Software
for OpenVMS automatically acquires a replacement disk from the spare-
set and performs reconstruction without storage administrator inter-
vention.

for OpenVMS, Version 2.1

To use StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS, the storage adminis-
trator first creates an array using DCL functions supplied with the
software. This destroys any data previously stored on the disks and
creates the data structures required to manage the array. The member
disks of a StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS array are ODS-2 struc-
tured volumes, so OpenVMS mechanisms protect against inadvertent mis-
use of members for the life of the array.

Each virtual disk created by StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS
is a single management entity. The storage administrator should use
appropriate storage management procedures (e.g., backups) with vir-
tual disks, which can be considerably larger than typical physical disks.
Once a collection of physical disks is bound into an array, it is not
possible to retrieve data directly from the array's individual mem-
ber disks.

Performance of StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS

The primary purpose of StorageWorks RAID for OpenVMS RAID Level 0 ar-
rays is to enhance application performance by improving I/O request
processing and/or data transfer rate. RAID Level 0 technology normally
implies a reduction in data reliability. The storage administrator can
improve data reliability by increasing backup frequency or using Stor-
ageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS in conjunction with Volume Shad-
owing for OpenVMS.

The primary purpose of StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS RAID Level
5 arrays is to improve data reliability. It may provide the secondary
benefit of improved performance (due to load balancing) for applica-
tions whose I/O workload consists largely of reading data. For appli-
cations with mostly write I/O workloads, StorageWorks RAID Software
for OpenVMS RAID Level 5 arrays may provide lower I/O performance than
conventional disks because it must update redundant information each
time an application writes data.

The storage administrator should understand application I/O charac-
teristics and weigh the relative priorities of performance, equipment
cost, and data reliability to determine whether StorageWorks RAID Soft-
ware for OpenVMS is appropriate for use with a given application.

OpenVMS Version 2.1. No other prerequisite software is required.
Mixed-architecture VMScluster systems are supported as long as all VM-
Scluster members are running compatible versions of the OpenVMS op-
erating system supported by StorageWorks RAID Software. For a chart
of the compatible versions of the operating systems, refer to the VAX-
cluster Software for OpenVMS VAX Software Product Description (SPD 29.78.xx)
and the VMScluster Software for OpenVMS AXP Software Product Descrip-
tion (SPD 42.18.xx).

If RAID Level 0 arrays with OpenVMS shadow sets as members are required,
a valid OpenVMS Volume Shadowing license must be in effect on every
VMScluster node running the StorageWorks RAID Software. Shadow sets
may not be used as members of RAID Level 5 arrays.

If either shadow sets whose members are directly-attached SCSI disks
or three-member shadow sets are required, then the OpenVMS remedial
kits as listed in the StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS V2.1 Re-
lease Notes must be installed.

This license option provides the purchaser with the right to use the
StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS on a single VAX or AXP proces-
sor to create and use up to the supported number (20) of RAID arrays.
One RAID Array Access License is required for each VAX or AXP proces-
sor in a VMScluster system on which StorageWorks RAID Software for Open-
VMS is to execute.

POLYCENTER Striping for OpenVMS license holders may upgrade their POLY-
CENTER Striping licenses to StorageWorks RAID Software for OpenVMS (VAX
platform) licenses by purchasing the QL-3AXA*-AA part numbers.

To be eligible to purchase a license with Universal Product Identi-
fier 3AX, a customer must be in possession of a valid POLYCENTER Strip-
ing license for the processor on which the 3AX license will be used.
By purchasing a 3AX license, the customer relinquishes his support rights
under the POLYCENTER Striping license, effectively exchanging it for
the StorageWorks RAID Software license he purchases.

Storage Concurrent Use License:
QL-0MGAA-3B

This license option provides the purchaser with the right to include
a single disk, storage element, or shadow set in an array. One Stor-
age Concurrent Use License is required for each disk, storage element,
or shadow set to be included in a StorageWorks RAID Software for Open-
VMS array. Once an array is created, it may be accessed by any VMSclus-
ter VAX or AXP processor.

For purposes of the Storage Concurrent Use License, the measure of use
is equal to a single disk, storage element, or shadow set to be in-
cluded in an array, no matter how many VMScluster CPUs have access to
that array.

Disks, storage elements, and shadow sets that are members of spare-
sets do not require Storage Concurrent Use Licenses.
