 PRODUCT NAME:  ALL-IN-1 Performance Reports for OpenVMS, Version 1.0A
 SPD 39.48.01

 DESCRIPTION

 ALL-IN-1 Performance Reports is an easy-to-use, menu-driven applica-
 tion that analyzes the ALL-IN-1 performance data collected by DECtrace
 and produces a variety of performance reports. The reports are pro-
 duced both as tables and bar charts, and are designed to give ALL-IN-1
 system managers/administrators the information needed to identify po-
 tential bottlenecks and those functions and users consuming the most
 system resources. Reports can be displayed on VT terminal screens or
 printed.

 The data formatted and presented by ALL-IN-1 Performance Reports is
 collected using DECtrace for VMS[*]. DECtrace for VMS is a general per-
 formance data collector that captures application and performance data
 from a wide variety of Digital products, including ALL-IN-1.

 Reports can provide information in seven statistical categories sorted
 in four different ways. The statistics reported on are:

 o  Frequency

 o  Buffered I/O

 o  Direct I/O

 o  Page Faults

 o  Page Fault I/O

 o  CPU usage

 ____________________

 The   terms VMS and OpenVMS refer to the OpenVMS Operating System.
