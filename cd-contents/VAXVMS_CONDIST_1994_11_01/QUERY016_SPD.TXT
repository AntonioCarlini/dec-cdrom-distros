           PRODUCT NAME:  DECquery for VMS, Version 1.6           SPD 36.77.00

           DESCRIPTION

           DECquery for VMS is an interactive database query tool for VAXstation
           computer users. It provides an OSF/Motif[TM] -compliant graphical in-
           terface that enables end-users to formulate queries and send them to
           a relational database to retrieve specific data.

           DECquery for VMS provides end-users with direct online access to lo-
           cal and remote server databases (such as Rdb/VMS, ULTRIX/SQL, IBM® DB2[TM],
           Oracle®, etc. Users can access any Digital Database Architecture-compliant
           data source and extract needed data for use in other workstation ap-
           plications.

           Features

           o  Retrieval access to data sources integrated with the Digital Database
              Architecture, including:

              -  VAX Rdb/VMS

              -  ULTRIX/SQL (through Ingres/Net)

              -  VAX DATATRIEVE

           o  Ability to select a sub-set of records to form a data collection,
              and to sort data in ascending/descending order by one or more fields.
              DECquery uses menus and dialog boxes to guide users through its query
              functions, alleviating the need to know complex Structured Query
              Language (SQL) syntax. (For users familiar with SQL syntax, the abil-
              ity to enter and change SQL commands directly is also provided.)

           o  Join function for combining multiple tables from supported data sources.

           o  Data aggregate calculations including Total, Average, Maximum, Min-
              imum, and Count by sub-groups of records, and computed columns where
              a column is based on one or more other columns in a database or on
              a column multiplied by a constant value, etc.

           o  Data formatting capabilities, including user customizable display
              edit strings, justification, color and font text attribute selec-
              tions.

           o  The ability to extract queried data into common interchange for-
              mats, through the CDA Converter Library, such as:

              -  CDA DTIF

              -  Lotus® 1-2-3® WK1 or WK3

              -  DIF

              -  tabular or delimited ASCII

              -  fielded ASCII

              This allows the use of the extracted data in various spreadsheet
              and graphing packages.

           o  Simple report generation using data from single or multiple data
              sources. This provides the user with the ability to establish line
              and page control breaks, and save or print the result to ASCII, PostScript®
              or CDA DDIF formats. Reports generated by DECquery can be automat-
              ically incorporated into DECwrite and DECpresent documents through
              support of the LiveLink capability. DECwrite can also read and edit
              DDIF report files directly.

           o  Create and maintain personal/work group databases in Rdb/VMS. Data
              can easily be entered and edited in a table, cut/copy/paste between
              windows, records updated and deleted, "Undo" of last function per-
              formed, etc. Personal/work group data can be combined with data from
              external sources.

           o  Record and playback for capturing query command procedures for later
              use. This allows users to create, store, re-use, and share specific
              queries for repetitive and shareable tasks. User prompting can be
              incorporated into stored queries to provide "fill-in-the-blank" queries
              for groups of users.

           o  Ability to automatically invoke and pass data to DECchart (avail-
              able with DECwrite and DECpresent) to create business graphs.

           o  View document utility for storing and displaying a reference within
              the database to a CDA document such as a letter created by DECwrite
              or a scanned image that has been converted to DDIF.

           o  Creation of Mail Merge files for use with DECwrite list process-
              ing.

           o  Public Folders for sharing databases in a work group and Private
              Folders for personal databases.

           o  Data security capabilities, including "Protection" for enabling or
              restricting users to read or modify tables, and "Access Mode" to
              determine how users can open a table (Read Only or Update).

           o  Utility for creating and maintaining a catalog of references to data
              available over the network. This allows users, data administrators,
              or system managers to customize lists of accessible databases for
              groups of users, pre-define the database access syntax and display
              it to users as a named entity.
