 PRODUCT NAME:  OSI Application Developer's Toolkit     SPD 34.98.02

 DESCRIPTION

 The OSI Applications Developer's Toolkit enables users to write dis-
 tributed applications that communicate over open networks and use the
 OSI services provided by DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS and DECnet/OSI for UL-
 TRIX.

 The Toolkit provides an application development environment which con-
 sists of:

 o  an interface to FTAM (File Transfer, Access and Management)

 o  interfaces to the ACSE and Presentation layers

 o  an interface to ROSE (Remote Operations Service Element)

 o  support for OSI Transaction Processing (OSI TP) (OpenVMS platforms)

 o  ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) tools (OpenVMS platforms)

 o  example programs

 and permits the application writers to use the services of the OSI up-
 per layers in their applications.

 The Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provide access to the
 OSI services supported by the underlying DECnet/OSI system.

 The ASN.1 tools provide a compiler and a library of encode/decode rou-
 tines.

                               DIGITAL                     June 1993

                                                         AE-PJA3C-TE

 

 The Toolkit allows for the development of applications on either Open-
 VMS or ULTRIX. For applications that are intended to run on both Open-
 VMS and ULTRIX systems, source code must be compiled and linked with
 the Toolkit on each operating system. The Toolkit is required on the
 development system and the compile/link system. The resulting appli-
 cation can be run on any DECnet/OSI system with the appropriate Op-
 erating System. The Toolkit is not required on these target systems.
 The current Toolkit versions are:

 o  ULTRIX: Version 1.1

 o  OpenVMS: Version 2.0

 Standards Supported

 FTAM

 FTAM supports the OSI standard:

 o  ISO 8571-Information Processing Systems-Open Systems Interconnection-
    File Transfer, Access and Management.

 The FTAM API provides the interface to the FTAM protocol machine pro-
 vided in DECnet/OSI. Communications between the application code and
 the FTAM protocol machine are carried out using ASN.1 encoded data struc-
 tures. The API supports the following functions

 o  Abort

 o  Begin-Group

 o  Cancel

 o  Change-Attributes

 o  Create

 o  Close

 o  Data

 o  Data-End

 o  Delete

 o  Deselect

 o  End-Group

 o  Initialize

 o  Open

 o  Read-Attributes

 o  Read

 o  Select

 o  Terminate

                                  3

 

 o  Transfer-End

 o  Write

 ACSE

 ACSE API supports the OSI standards:

 o  ISO 8650-Information Processing Systems-Open Systems Interconnection-
    Protocol Specification for the Association Control Service Element.

 o  ISO 8649-Information Processing Systems-Open Systems Interconnection-
    Service Definition for the Association Control Service Element.

 The ACSE API provides the interface to the associate and release ser-
 vices. The services provided are

 o  Associate

 o  Release

 o  Abort

 o  Redirect

 The redirect service is not an ACSE service. It allows applications
 to redirect an incoming association to another process on the local
 system.

 Presentation

 The implementation of the Presentation layer in the Toolkit supports
 the OSI standards:

 o  ISO 8823-Information Processing Systems-Open Systems Interconnection-
    Connection Oriented Presentation Protocol Specification

 o  ISO 8822-Information Processing Systems-Open Systems Interconnection-
    Connection Oriented Presentation Service Definition

 o  ISO 8327-Information Processing Systems-Open Systems Interconnection-
    Basic Connection Oriented Session Protocol Specification

                                  4

 

 o  ISO 8326-Information Processing Systems-Open Systems Interconnection-
    Basic Connection Oriented Session Service Definition.

 The Presentation API provides the interface to the Presentation layer
 services and, by pass through, to the equivalent Session layer ser-
 vices. The API supports the following services:

 o  Alter-Context

 o  Data

 o  Capability-Data

 o  Expedited-Data

 o  Typed-Data

 o  Token-Please

 o  Token-Give

 o  Control-Give

 o  Sync-Major

 o  Sync-Minor

 o  Resynchronize

 o  Exception-Report

 o  Activity-Start

 o  Activity-Interrupt

 o  Activity-Resume

 o  Activity-Discard

 o  Activity-End

 o  Abort

                                  5

 

 The Session layer supports ISO Session Version 1 and Version 2. Ses-
 sion Version 1 allows up to 512 octets of user data on a service. Ses-
 sion Version 2 supports the restrictions imposed by the National In-
 stitute of Standards and Technology allowing up to 10,240 octets of
 data on a service.

 ROSE

 ROSE supports the OSI standard:

 o  ISO 9072 - Information Processing Systems - Text Communications -
    Remote Operations

 ROSE supports interactive applications in a distributed open systems
 environment. It is a service for multivendor distributed processing.

 The ROSE functionality provides a mechanism which allows for the en-
 coding and decoding of the Remote Operations Protocol Control Infor-
 mation, as defined in ISO 9072, for the following services:

 o  Invoke

 o  Result

 o  Error

 o  Reject

 OSI TP

 The OSI TP component of the Toolkit supports the OSI standard:

 o  ISO/IEC 10026-Information Technology-Open Systems Interconnection-
    Distributed Transaction Processing (OSI TP)

 OSI TP resides at the Application layer of the OSI Reference Model.
 It provides sufficient facilities to support transaction processing
 among two or more open systems. It can also be used as a communica-
 tions subsystem connecting distributed applications involved in peer-
 to-peer communications in an OSI environment (for example, with no need
 for transaction processing).

                                  6

 

 The OSI TP component provides:

 o  Dialogue

 o  Shared Control

 o  Polarized Control

 o  Handshake

 The OSI TP component does not currently support the transactional func-
 tional units.

 ASN.1

 ASN.1 compiler is based on the following OSI standards:

 o  ISO 8824-Information Processing Systems-Open Systems Interconnection-
    Specification of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)

 o  ISO 8825-Information Processing Systems-Open Systems Interconnection-
    Specification of Basic Encoding Rules for Abstract Syntax Notation
    One (ASN.1)

 The ASN.1 compiler is capable of processing the full syntax specified
 in ISO 8824 (v1988 and v1990) without any additional or special aug-
 mentations to the syntax. Macros are fully supported by the compiler.
 In addition to the compiler, there are four core components:

 o  buffer management

 o  encoding protocol

 o  decoding protocol

 o  protocol tracing

 The compiler produces a "C" header file that provides a "C" represen-
 tation of the ASN.1 structures and PDU definitions. Compile time op-
 tions select either a space optimized (table driven) or a time opti-
 mized (generated in line code) variant of C-source output, however the
 "C" header file remains the same in both cases.

                                  7

 

 The compiler and associated run-time components are terminal line mode
 based. A windows interface is not provided in the current release.
