 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC TCP/IP Services for                 SPD 25.A4.05
                OpenVMS VAX, Version 3.1

 DESCRIPTION

 The DEC TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS VAX product is a layered software
 product that provides interoperability and resource sharing between
 OpenVMS VAX systems, UNIX[R] systems, and other systems that support
 the TCP/IP Protocol Suite, and Sun[R] Microsystems' NFS[TM].

 The DEC TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS VAX (TCP/IP) product provides net-
 work file access, remote terminal access, remote command execution,
 remote printing, mail, and application development. DEC TCP/IP Ser-
 vices for OpenVMS VAX is also identified by the acronymn "UCX".

 FEATURES

 Installation and Configuration
 The DEC TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS VAX V3.1 product is installed with
 VMSINSTAL.

 For configuration ease, the DEC TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS product
 provides a menu-driven configuration procedure. This procedure enables
 you to configure only those services and applications that you use.
 It also enables you to configure all client software components quickly
 without selecting individual menu options.

 Communications

 Communications are based on the 4.3 Berkeley Software Distribution,
 implementing the following protocols and features:

 o  Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

 o  Internet Protocol (IP)

 o  Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)

 o  Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

 o  User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

 o  Routing Information Protocol (RIP)

 o  Ethernet support

 o  FDDI support

 o  Auxiliary (AUX) Server (inetd), plus enhancements such as security
    and event logging

 Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) Support

 FDDI is an ANSI standard for a network technology based on fiber op-
 tics. It specifies a 100-megabit-per-second transmission rate. DEC TCP
 /IP Services for OpenVMS VAX allows OpenVMS VAX systems to take ad-
 vantage of this technology by enabling TCP/IP communications with other
 hosts in these configurations:

 o  On the same FDDI network

 o  Over a FDDI/Ethernet bridge

 o  Over a router

 OpenVMS VAX hosts are also able to act as an Internet gateway between
 FDDI networks and one or more Ethernets.

 The management of the FDDI controller is integrated with the TCP/IP
 network management interface.

                                  2

 

 Auxiliary Server inetd

 The inetd software is the TCP/IP service dispatcher for UNIX systems
 which was first provided by Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) 4.3.

 This feature significantly simplifies the writing of applications and
 manages overhead by reducing the number of simultaneous server pro-
 cesses on the system.

 The DEC TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS VAX implementation of inetd:

 o  Listens for incoming connection requests and appropriately starts
    application services. It controls dynamic process creation in the
    same manner as the UNIX based inetd.

 o  Provides a Services Database.

 o  Provides security features.

 o  Offers event logging.




















                                  3

 

 BIND Server

 Translates Domain Name System host names to IP addresses. Network man-
 agers set up a BIND database to configure primary, secondary, and caching
 servers on OpenVMS VAX hosts. This complements the BIND resolver, the
 client part of BIND that requests name-to-address translations from
 a BIND server.

 Remote Booting

 Remote host booting of diskless clients using OpenVMS VAX as the boot
 server. This feature uses the BOOTP and TFTP Protocols to initiate the
 boot request and to download the boot files.

 UCX Management with Command-line Interface

 UCX Management provides DCL-style commands to control and monitor the
 UCX software components.

 Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Agent

 SNMP is the internet standard protocol for network management over TCP
 /IP. The SNMP agent communicates with network management directors to
 provide information about network activity. MIB II variables are sup-
 ported within SNMP.

 Security and Network Access Control

 System managers use network security features to control the acces-
 sibility to OpenVMS VAX systems from remote Internet hosts.

 Application Programming Interfaces

 DEC TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS VAX V3.1 includes the following ap-
 plication programming interfaces:

 -  C socket programming interface
    Provides the Berkeley socket programming interface to develop TCP
    /IP networking applications in the C language.

 -  QIO programming interface
    Provides a QIO programming interface to develop TCP/IP networking
    applications in any OpenVMS VAX language.

                                  4

 

 -  SRIQIO interface
    Provides emulation of the SRIQIO interface.

 -  SunRPC, with XDR and Portmapper
    Sun[R] Remote Procedure Calls (SunRPC) are included in the UCX Pro-
    gramming interface. The SunRPC library includes a library of RPC
    function calls, the Portmapper module, and eXternal Data Represen-
    tation (XDR) routines.

 Applications

 This component includes the widespread end-user protocols for file trans-
 fer, remote login, remote command processing, remote printing, and mail
 exchange.

 o  File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

 FTP is the internet application protocol for file transfer. It enables
 users to transfer files to and from remote hosts.

 o  Telnet

 Telnet is the internet application protocol for remote login. It en-
 ables OpenVMS VAX users to log into remote systems and remote users
 to log into OpenVMS VAX systems.

 Telnet provides support for both character and line modes. It also en-
 ables users to activate multiple Telnet sessions.

 o  Telnet 3270

 Telnet 3270 enables users to make Telnet connections from OpenVMS VAX
 systems to remote IBM[R] systems using a 3270-style terminal inter-
 face.

 o  Berkeley Remote Commands (rlogin, rsh, rexec)

 DEC TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS VAX implements the popular UNIX re-
 mote login (rlogin), remote shell (rsh), and remote executive (rexec)
 services.

 Like Telnet, remote login (rlogin) enables users to log into remote
 systems and remote users to log into OpenVMS VAX systems.

                                  5

 

 Rsh enables OpenVMS VAX users to execute commands on remote systems
 and remote users to execute DCL commands on OpenVMS VAX systems. Au-
 thentication is based on either user password or proxy access.

 o  Remote printing

 DEC TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS VAX provides the following remote print-
 ing services:

 OpenVMS VAX users can issue DCL-style PRINT commands to print files
 on remote systems using the LPD protocol.

 Similarly, remote users can print files on OpenVMS VAX systems using
 the LPD protocol.

 OpenVMS VAX users can also use the TELNET Print Symbiont to print files
 on remote systems.

 o  Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)

 SMTP is the internet application protocol for mail. Users can send and
 receive electronic mail to and from remote hosts.

 Network File System

 The NFS[TM] software supports the Network File System (NFS) V2.0 pro-
 tocol specifications. NFS is an application layer protocol that pro-
 vides clients with transparent access to remote file services.

 The NFS server software promotes data sharing among clients by pro-
 viding a central data storage facility for OpenVMS VAX and UNIX files.
 The NFS server software provides two types of file access for remote
 clients:

 o  Access to OpenVMS VAX files

 o  Access to files that are compatible with the UNIX Operating Sys-
    tem.


                                  6

 

 Automount

 As implemented in DEC TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS VAX, the NFS AUTO-
 MOUNT command transparently mounts and unmounts NFS file systems on
 an as-needed basis, especially useful for mounting file systems and
 directories that are occasionally needed.

 File Conversion On-The-Fly

 Maximizes interoperability between OpenVMS VAX and other systems uti-
 lizing the NFS Protocol by providing a sequential "read on-the-fly"
 file conversion capability.

 PC-NFS Server

 Remote PC users mount and access NFS files from OpenVMS VAX. UID/GID
 identification and authentication of the remote PC user is established
 through the use of the UCX Proxy Database. Once access is established,
 users can print via the PC-NFS printing mechanism.
