 PRODUCT NAME:  VAX COBOL Version 5.2                   SPD 25.04.26
                for OpenVMS VAX Systems

 DESCRIPTION

 VAX COBOL  is a high-level language for business data processing that
 operates  under  the   OpenVMS  VAX  Operating  System,  taking  full
 advantage  of  the  system    facilities   and  the  VAX  Information
 Architecture.  VAX COBOL is  based  upon the 1985 ANSI COBOL Standard
 X3.23-1985 as modified by the X.23a-1989 amendment.

 VAX COBOL is integrated with the  VAX  Information  Architecture  and
 includes  various  Digital  extensions  to  COBOL,  including  screen
 handling at the source language level as well  as  file  sharing  and
 record locking.

 VAX COBOL has been validated at the high level by the National Bureau
 of  Standards  for  conformance  to  "FIPS PUB 21-3, Federal Standard
 COBOL."

 Two  features provide access to the VAX Information Architecture from
 VAX COBOL:    the Data Manipulation Language and CDD/Repository.  The
 Data  Manipulation  Language   (DML)  allows  users  to  access  DBMS
 databases with VAX DBMS.    VAX  DBMS  must  be installed to use this
 feature.  The COPY FROM  DICTIONARY  statement, another Digital COBOL
 extension,  allows  access  to common record  definitions  stored  in
 CDD/Repository  (formerly  VAX  CDD/Plus).    CDD/Repository must  be
 installed to use this feature.

 The  following  partial  list  of  Digital  extensions to  COBOL  are
 implemented in VAX COBOL:

 o  Screen  handling  is  implemented  using  the  DISPLAY  and ACCEPT
    statements.   The  DISPLAY  statement  enables  the  programmer to
    display information or  prompts  anywhere  on a video screen.  The
    ACCEPT statement takes information  typed  anywhere  on the screen
    and returns the value to a running VAX COBOL program.  The DISPLAY
    statement  converts data from internal numeric  format  to  "ASCII


                               DIGITAL                 February 1994
                                                         AE-PVLJB-TE

 

    display  format";    and  the  ACCEPT  WITH  CONVERSION  statement
    converts  "ASCII  display"  input  characters  to internal numeric
    formats  as  appropriate.    The  terminal-type  is  recognized at
    runtime from information provided by the operating system.

 o  RMS-STS and  RMS-STV  special  registers may be examined to assist
    debugging.  These  registers contain status values from the Record
    Management System (OpenVMS for VAX RMS).

 o  File sharing and record locking features enable more than one user
    to access data at the same time.

 o  Many file capabilities are  available  through OpenVMS for VAX RMS
    including  extensions  for  segmented keys,  descending  keys  and
    duplicate primary keys.

 o  Conditional compilation serves to make debugging easier.

 o  The  /INSTRUCTION_SET qualifier customizes object code  generation
    to  target  the  different classes of VAX  processors,  maximizing
    specific processor features.

 o  Access to VAX DBMS databases through CODASYL's definition of COBOL
    Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements.

 o  Access to CDD/Repository record and field definitions.

 o  Source program terminal format recognition.

 VAX COBOL  implements  several  statements and extensions designed to
 make programming easier in the OpenVMS for VAX environment:

 o  CALL statement extensions:  BY VALUE, BY DESCRIPTOR, OMITTED,  and
    GIVING

 o  VALUE IS EXTERNAL - Access to link time constants

 o  USAGE IS POINTER - Address data type

 o  VALUE IS REFERENCE - Compile time address evaluation

 o  SET TO REFERENCE - Runtime address evaluation

                                  2

 

 o  SUCCESS/FAILURE - Class conditions

 o  31-character user-names

 o  ACCEPT AT END statement

 o  Single-quote-delimited, non-numeric literals

 o  Hyphen/underscore equivalence in user-names

 o  Non-numeric literal argument passing

 The VAX  COBOL  compiler  produces  an  object  module  from a source
 program.  The compiler is capable of producing a source listing  with
 embedded  diagnostics  indicating    the   line  and  position  of  a
 source-code error, a machine  language  listing,  a  file-name map, a
 data-name map, a procedure-name map,  an  external  program name map,
 subschema  information,  and  a  cross-reference  listing.        The
 cross-reference  listing  and  maps  may  be  produced    in   either
 alphabetical order or in order of declaration.   The  cross-reference
 listing  distinguishes  destructive references to data from read-only
 references.

 VAX COBOL  provides support for error diagnostics and cross-reference
 information to DEC  Language-Sensitive  Editor/Source  Code Analyzer.
 Additionally,  VAX  COBOL provides  support  for  the  processing  of
 pseudocode   and  design  comments  which    are    used    by    DEC
 Language-Sensitive Editor /Source Code Analyzer for low-level program
 design.

 Object  modules produced by the compiler can  be  linked  with  other
 object modules produced by many other languages, including  VAX BASIC
 and DEC FORTRAN.  VAX COBOL is supported by  both the OpenVMS for VAX
 Common Run Time Library (OpenVMS for VAX RTL) and the OpenVMS for VAX
 Symbolic Debugger.

 The  VAX  COBOL  product  includes  a COBOL compiler and the REFORMAT
 utility.  The  REFORMAT utility converts source programs from Digital
 terminal format to ANSI-standard COBOL format and vice versa.
