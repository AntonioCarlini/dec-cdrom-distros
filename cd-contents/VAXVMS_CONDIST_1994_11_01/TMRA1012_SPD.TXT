 PRODUCT NAME:  TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 OpenVMS VAX V1.2      SPD 33.75.02
			
 DESCRIPTION

 TeamRoute is an electronic document initiation, routing, approval, and
 tracking system. It works between members of an organization distributed
 across wide-area and/or local-area networks. It is designed to accom-
 modate the primary attributes of paper-based document processing sys-
 tems with the added flexibility, security, and efficiency common to
 electronic processing systems. The design considers the diverse and
 ever-changing needs of an organization's administrative systems.

 TeamRoute uses the master routing package as the model for gathering,
 disseminating, processing, and presenting information. It allows an
 end user to select a template from a library of templates, create a
 new routing package from that template, specify the routing list, en-
 ter information into applicable fields, attach any relevant informa-
 tion, and route the master routing package and any attachments to users
 or other applications for processing and/or approval/disapproval.

 TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 supports interaction among a heterogeneous group
 of clients and among multiple server domains. Microsoft[R] Windows[TM] 
 and Apple[R] Macintosh[R] clients are supported using the TeamLinks V2.1
 client software (SPD 55.49.**). Video Terminals (VTs) are supported by
 the TeamRoute ALL-IN-1 client hosted by ALL-IN-1. The TeamRoute for 
 ALL-IN-1 client requires ALL-IN-1 Version 3.0A or Version 3.1 for OpenVMS
 VAX product. 

 TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 is accessible as a separate subsystem of ALL-IN-1.
 Routing packages are received, filed, and organized in a separate in-
 box within the user's File Cabinet. The VT user chooses TeamRoute from
 the ALL-IN-1 main menu to enter the system. TeamLinks users gain access
 by a button on the button bar or via the TeamRoute icon. TeamRoute uses 
 ALL-IN-1 nicknames.

 TeamRoute allows routing of documents within departmental local-area
 networks, and across wide-area, store-and-forward networks by utiliz-
 ing Digital's ALL-IN-1 Electronic Mail and MAILbus products.

 Features

 API

 A public Application Programmers Interface (API), which allows users
 to create linkages with new and existing applications, is documented
 in the TeamRoute Programming Guide.

 Templates

 Master routing packages are produced from modifiable templates. Mod-
 ifiable templates and routing package ownership allows users to stip-
 ulate routing policies and receipt actions for a master routing pack-
 age.

 Sample Applications

 TeamRoute provides several sample applications in the form of pre-defined
 templates. These sample applications demonstrate the capabilities of
 TeamRoute and can be used by users with or without modifications. These
 sample applications include: Action Item, Document Review, Read and
 Acknowledge, Telephone Call Slip, Account Request, Meeting Notice, Ask
 a Question, and Travel Request.

 Routing Packages

 A routing package is the object that is created by the initiator and
 routed to recipients. It is created by selecting a template and fill-
 ing out the routing list, adding attachments, and signing it. The rout-
 ing package at this point becomes the "Master" and is stored in the
 initiator's File Cabinet on the server. Routing copies are sent to re-
 cipients who can add attachments or modify the routing list of the mas-
 ter copy. Recipients can save their copies in their own personal File
 Cabinets. The master gets updated throughout the lifecycle of the rout-
 ing package.


 User Roles and Policies

 During the lifecycle of a routing package, all participants play one
 or more specified roles. For example, a user may be an approver at one
 step and a carbon copy (cc:) recipient at another step. Roles are as-
 signed by the routing package initiator or template designer. Roles
 are defined by a set of rights (what a user can do), requirements (what
 a user must do), and optionally, the name of an application to invoke.

 Routing Package Tracking

 Tracking can be requested for any routing package stored in a user's
 File Cabinet. When tracking is requested, the Server sends a new car-
 bon copy of the master in its current state.

 A routing package's history is used to monitor its progress. The events
 logged in the routing package history include: when signatures are ap-
 plied, if the application was run, when copies were sent, and when up-
 dates were applied.

 Routing

 Routing is defined by a routing list. The Server sends routing pack-
 ages according to the position of the recipients in the routing list.
 It updates the master when it receives a revised copy from a recip-
 ient, and then sends a new copy to the next recipient on the list.

 The routing list is created by the routing package initiator or the
 template designer. However, the path a routing package takes during
 its lifecycle may differ from the one specified in the original rout-
 ing list because someone along the way may modify it. Serial and carbon-
 copy parallel routing are both available.

 Attachments

 An attachment is any additional file or document that is routed with
 the master routing package. When a file or document is attached, the
 server marks that attachment with the name of the user adding the at-
 tachment, an attachment ID, the date and time of addition, a user-provided
 subject label, attachment, data type, and file name. The date and time
 of addition is the local date and time.

 Signatures

 Signatures is a password-protected function that indicates approval,
 disapproval, or acknowledgment of a routing package. If an attachment
 is subsequently removed or a key field value altered, the signature
 becomes invalid.

 When users sign a routing package, TeamRoute adds their name, the date
 and time, any added remarks, and the approval action. Recipients view-
 ing signatures are shown whether the signature remains valid.

 Help

 Users can get help for TeamRoute by using the Help facility. Help pro-
 vides basic information on how to perform the function in question with-
 out the user having to reference the documentation.

 Printing

 TeamRoute takes advantage of the printing facilities provided by the
 underlying mail system. The user can specify the printer destination
 and options.

 Editing

 TeamRoute allows the VT user to specify their editor of choice 
 supported by ALL-IN-1 Electronic Mail. TeamLinks users may specify their
 wordprocessor of choice from those installed on their PC.

 System Management

 TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 provides a separate management utility. Invok-
 ing these utilities allows cluster-wide system management operations
 to be managed centrally.

 There are no special utilities to run for File Cabinet maintenance.
 One or all user areas on the Server can be backed up or restored us-
 ing standard OpenVMS utilities.

 Internationalization

 TeamRoute is designed to support multi-lingual operations. It can be
 deployed in a multi-lingual network and can support multi-lingual op-
 erations on a single server system. For more information, contact your
 local Digital office.

 Documentation

 Documentation of the installation, system management, programming, and
 user procedures is included with the individual kits.
