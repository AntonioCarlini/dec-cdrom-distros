 DESCRIPTION

 The PrintServer Software is a layered product that enables one or both
 of the following:

 o  Suitably configured systems to communicate within an Ethernet net-
    work to a PrintServer 17, PrintServer 17/600, PrintServer 20, turbo
    PrintServer 20, PrintServer 32, PrintGate/32, PrintServer 40, or
    PrintServer 40 plus and to use printing and accounting services

 o  Suitably configured systems within an Ethernet local area network
    (LAN) to initialize (boot) and provide support functions for the
    PrintServer 17, PrintServer 17/600, PrintServer 20, turbo PrintServer
    20, PrintServer 32, PrintGate/32, PrintServer 40, and PrintServer
    40 plus

 In general, there are two primary components included in the PrintServer
 Software: print client software and supporting host software.

 The print client software consists of the following components:

 o  Print filters or interface programs to process requests from one
    or more printer queues that provide print options to select PrintServer
    features and page setup

 o  Network software to transmit print requests and associated data over
    Ethernet to a remote PrintServer printer via DECnet or INTERNET (TCP
    /IP) protocols

 o  Translators that automatically convert file formats into the PostScript[R]
    page description language

 o  Event logging that captures error and status information and de-
    livers it to specified users and/or operators

                                  2

 

 o  Print client and local accounting for tracking printer usage

 o  Online help or manual pages providing help for the user

 o  Installation scripts and/or instructions

 The print client software must reside on each system or file server
 that either wants to print directly or provide distributed printing
 services for other systems (remote spooling) to Digital's PrintServer
 printers. A system running the print client software can transmit print
 requests to any suitably configured PrintServer printer that is de-
 fined in the system's network database. The maximum number of print
 clients that can be simultaneously connected to a PrintServer 17, PrintServer
 17/600, PrintServer 20, turbo PrintServer 20, PrintServer 32, Print-
 Gate/32, or PrintServer 40 plus is 16; on a PrintServer 40 the max-
 imum is 12.

 Note: The maximum number of print clients that can be simultaneously
 connected to the PrintServer 17 family of printers is dependent upon
 the installed memory configuration.

 The supporting host software consists of the following components:

 o  A primary boot system image file that is downloaded into the PrintServer
    printer when the printer is powered on or remotely triggered.

 o  A management client that loads the secondary boot files and printer
    configuration files, and provides for the capture and storage of
    centralized accounting and event log information from the printer.

 o  A remote management utility that provides remote monitoring and man-
    agement functions of a PrintServer printer from a terminal, ter-
    minal window, or GUI on either a print client or supporting host
    system.

 o  PrintServer system software that provides communications services,
    remote management services, and the PostScript interpreter. The in-
    terpreter processes PostScript commands and generates imaging data
    for the printer controller.

                                  3

 

 If multiple PrintServer printers reside on the same LAN, one or more
 supporting hosts can be used to load and/or manage them. A single sup-
 porting host can service any number of PrintServer printers; conversely,
 a number of supporting hosts can service a single printer to provide
 a high degree of fault tolerance.

 Print Client Features

 The print client features described in this SPD are available for the
 following platforms: HP-UX, IBM-AIX, NetWare, OSF/1, SCO UNIX, SCO UNIX
 /DECadvantage, SunOS, ULTRIX, AT&T Unison, and Windows NT.

 In an OpenVMS operating environment, the print client software is pro-
 vided through DECprint Supervisor for OpenVMS. The media and documen-
 tation for DECprint Supervisor for OpenVMS are bundled with the PrintServer
 Software for OpenVMS (and available separately). Refer to the Soft-
 ware Product Description (SPD 44.15.xx) for more information on DECprint
 Supervisor for OpenVMS.

 In an ULTRIX operating environment, the print client software is pro-
 vided through the ULTRIX Operating System. The license to use this soft-
 ware is bundled with the ULTRIX Operating System.

 Printer Interface

 The PrintServer Software provides an interface for use with your op-
 erating system. The interface transmits print requests over the Eth-
 ernet network to the printer and relays system messages from the printer
 to the spooling system and/or requesting user.

 The PrintServer Software allows users to print non-PostScript docu-
 ments by translating the text into PostScript. Translation can be re-
 quested explicitly on the command line, or performed automatically when
 the document is printed. ASCII translation is provided for all oper-
 ating environments.

 In a Windows NT operating environment, translation occurs automati-
 cally when your application submits a print job to the spooling sys-
 tem. The spooling system provides the printer with all fonts required
 to print the job successfully.

                                  4

 

 In a NetWare operating environment, a PrintServer specific Printer De-
 scription File (PDF) containing modes and functions to select vari-
 ous PrintServer features and options are provided. Print drivers for
 Microsoft[R] Windows[TM] 3.1 are also provided.

 In NetWare and OpenVMS operating environments, the PrintServer Soft-
 ware allows users to print PCL5 documents on PrintServer 17 and PrintServer
 17/600 PostScript level 2 printers. Interpretation is performed in the
 printer (versus being translated on the host system) when the docu-
 ment is printed.

 In an SCO UNIX/DECadvantage operating environment, an interface pro-
 gram is included that allows users to print images (CCITT Group 3 and
 Group 4) at near engine speed on PrintServer 17, PrintServer 17/600,
 turbo PrintServer 20, PrintServer 32, and PrintGate/32 printers.

 In an ULTRIX operating environment, TEKTRONIX[R] and ReGIS transla-
 tors are also provided for VAX processors. Refer to the Software Prod-
 uct Description (SPD 26.40.xx) for more information.





















                                  5

 In UNIX environments, the output can be redirected not only to a print
 queue, but also to a file for printing later on a Digital PostScript
 printer.

 Supporting Host Features

 The supporting host features described in this SPD are available for
 the following platforms: HP-UX, IBM-AIX, NetWare, OpenVMS, OSF/1, SCO
 UNIX, SCO UNIX/DECadvantage, SunOS, ULTRIX, and AT&T Unison.

 In a Windows NT operating environment, only print client software is
 provided. Windows NT environments rely on one of the other supported
 systems to provide supporting host features and services for PrintServer
 printers. PostScript

 PostScript is a device-independent, page description language that has
 the ability to describe the appearance of text, images, and graphic
 material on the printed page.

 The PostScript language's page description capabilities include the
 following features, which can be used in any combination:

 o  Arbitrary shapes constructed from straight lines, arcs, and cubic
    curves; such shapes can self-intersect and contain disconnected sec-
    tions and holes.

 o  Painting primitives that permit a shape to be outlined with lines
    of any thickness, filled with any gray shade, or used as a clip-
    ping path to crop any other graphics.

 o  Text fully integrated with graphics. Text characters are treated
    as graphical shapes that can be operated on by any PostScript graph-
    ics operator.

 o  Sampled images derived from natural sources or generated synthet-
    ically. The PostScript graphics model allows sampled images at any
    resolution and with a variety of dynamic ranges, and it provides
    a number of facilities to control the rendering of images on the
    PrintServer printer.

                                  7

 

 o  A general coordinate system facility that supports all combinations
    of linear transformations including translation, scaling, rotation,
    reflection, and skewing. These transformations apply uniformly to
    all elements of a page description, including text, graphical shapes,
    and sampled images.

 o  A rendering algorithm, DECimage Plus, that enhances the quality of
    natural (halftone) images when printed on laser printers.

 PostScript level 2 extends the functional range of the PostScript lan-
 guage by adding new features designed to more conveniently and effi-
 ciently describe the appearance of the page. PostScript level 2 fea-
 tures include:

 o  Form and pattern caching will drastically reduce print times where
    repetitive elements, such as corporate logos or accent bars, are
    repeated on successive pages.

 o  ATM font rendering provides higher quality and is notably faster
    than the rendering mechanism in PostScript level 1.

 o  Data-compression and decompression filters for several industry-
    standard formats (i.e., CCITT Group 3 and Group 4) will enable much
    faster data transmission times and reduce storage requirements for
    PostScript files.

 o  Improved printer-based memory management will facilitate the print-
    ing of more complex pages in a shorter amount of time.

 PostScript level 1 is provided for Digital's PrintServer printers ex-
 cept in NetWare, OpenVMS, and ULTRIX operating environments where PostScript
 level 2 is provided for the PrintServer 17 family of printers.

 PCL5

 In NetWare and OpenVMS operating environments, PCL5 interpretation is
 provided for the PrintServer 17 (with at least 12 MB memory) and PrintServer
 17/600 PostScript level 2 printers. The PCL5 interpreter supports HP[R]


                                  8

 

 LaserJet[R] IIIsi emulation as described in the HP PCL5 Printer Lan-
 guage Technical Reference Manual and as implemented in the HP Laser-
 Jet IIIsi printer. PCL5 files are passed directly to the PCL5 inter-
 preter within the printer and processed for printing. PCL5 supports
 interpretation and the printing of both 300 and 600 dpi files.

 Resident scaleable typefaces include:

 o  Univers[R] Medium

 o  Univers Medium Italic

 o  Univers Bold

 o  Univers Bold Italic

 o  Times[R] Medium

 o  Times Medium Italic

 o  Times Bold

 o  Times Bold Italic

 o  Univers Condensed[R]

 Bitmap font support includes:

 o  Courier 10 pitch 12 point (italic,bold)

 o  Courier 12 pitch 10 point (italic,bold)

 o  Line Printer 16.66 pitch 8.5 point (landscape, portrait)

 Image Printing

                                  9

 

 An image PDL is provided for the turbo PrintServer 20, PrintServer 32,
 and PrintGate/32 printers in an OpenVMS operating environment and for
 the PrintServer 17, turbo PrintServer 20, PrintServer 32, and Print-
 Gate/32 printers in the SCO UNIX/DECadvantage operating environment.
 The image PDL greatly reduces the printing time for Digital Document
 Interchange Format (DDIF) compressed bitonal image files, such as those
 created by certain scanning devices. The use of the image PDL passes
 files directly to the PrintServer's image decompression chip within
 the printer, bypassing and eliminating conversion to PostScript.

 The image PDL provides the following features:

 o  Uses the printer's hardware decompression capability for faster print-
    ing

 o  Automatically rotates and crops images to fit paper size and ori-
    entation

 o  Automatically scales 200 dpi A-size images to 300 dpi A-size im-
    ages

 o  Supports CCITT compression standards: CCITT G42D, CCITT G31D, and
    CCITT G32D

 o  Media size support is PrintServer printer dependent

 Remote Management Services

 Remote management services are available through either a Graphical
 User Interface (GUI) based on Motif[R] platforms or a command-line in-
 terface for all PrintServer printers at terminals on systems where the
 remote management files are installed. This enables any user to re-
 motely monitor the status of the PrintServer system.

 There are two types of remote management modes: privileged and unpriv-
 ileged. To access privileged functions, a password must be entered.
 Unprivileged commands are available under the privileged mode.

 ____________between_print_jobs_____________________________________

 The PrintServer 17, PrintServer 17/600, PrintServer 20, turbo PrintServer
 20, PrintServer 32, and PrintGate/32 printers have front panels with


                                 11

 

 a 2 x 24 character LCD display that provides system status informa-
 tion. Front panel status messages can be displayed in English, French,
 German, Dutch, Swedish, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, or Norwegian.
 Centralized Event Logging

 The PrintServer Software logs events ranging from successful comple-
 tion of jobs to hardware errors. Events can be recorded in an event
 log file on a management client system. Management clients on multi-
 ple systems can simultaneously receive event logging data from a sin-
 gle PrintServer printer. These events are also displayed on remote man-
 agement terminals and the PrintServer 40 local console. A subset of
 event messages is displayed on the front panel of the PrintServer 17,
 PrintServer 17/600, PrintServer 20, turbo PrintServer 20, PrintServer
 32, and PrintGate/32 printers.

 Centralized Accounting

 Similar to event logging, accounting information is sent to any man-
 agement client that requests accounting data upon connecting to a PrintServer
 printer. The PrintServer Software contains its own accounting util-
 ity, providing the system manager with a convenient way to analyze and
 report printer usage or cross-charge users and departments for printer
 usage.

 The accounting utility prepares usage reports for a specific PrintServer
 printer on a per-user and per-host basis. Accounting information in-
 cludes user name, originating host, total number of sheets and sides
 printed, sheet size, and printer CPU time. The utility can assist in
 billing users by allowing the system manager to assign cost to the num-
 ber of sheets printed, the number of sides printed, and/or CPU used.
 The utility also allows for reporting to begin from a specific date.
 In addition, data is stored in a specific format to allow for third
 party applications to read from and manipulate information.

 The Centralized Accounting utility is not available in an AT&T Uni-
 son operating environment because Unison controls accounting.

 Controlled Access to a PrintServer Printer


                                 12

 

 The PrintServer system provides a convenient way to control network
 access to a PrintServer printer. Access to the printer is specified
 in the printer configuration by either "allowing" or "denying" access
 by a client host. The "allow" option adds DECnet area numbers or node
 addresses and INTERNET host addresses, networks, or subnetwork num-
 bers to the list of nodes or areas that are allowed to communicate with
 the PrintServer printer. The "deny" option adds to the list of nodes,
 areas, hosts, networks, and subnetworks that are not allowed to com-
 municate with the printer.

 Downloading the PrintServer Image

 A PrintServer printer is booted in two phases, the primary boot and
 the secondary boot. During the primary boot, a supporting host down-
 loads the system image upon receipt of a MOP or bootp protocol load
 request by the printer. If multiple supporting hosts are designated
 to boot the printer, the first system to respond to the printer load
 request provides the primary boot. Once the primary boot has been com-
 pleted, a management client connects to the printer to perform the sec-
 ondary boot.

 The secondary boot involves downloading configuration and setup files
 and system process image files.

 PrintServer 40 and PrintServer 40 plus printers require the MOP pro-
 tocol to boot. MOP is available on Digital's ULTRIX and OpenVMS op-
 erating systems. PrintServer 17, PrintServer 17/600, PrintServer 20,
 turbo PrintServer 20, PrintServer 32, and PrintGate/32, printers can
 accept either MOP or bootp.

 turbo PrintServer 20 printers require controller firmware V3.1 or higher
 when booted by HP-UX, IBM-AIX, SCO UNIX, and SCO UNIX/DECadvantage sys-
 tems or if the printer is booted bootp and accessed by DECnet systems.

 PrintServer 20 printers must be booted by an OpenVMS, OSF/1, SunOS,
 or ULTRIX system.

 PrintServer System and Imaging Components


                                 13

 

 The PrintServer System and Process Image Components are the software
 elements that are downloaded to, and run within, a PrintServer printer.
 This software consists of the following parts:

 o  Communications software that accepts print and control data from
    INTERNET or DECnet client hosts and passes print data to the imag-
    ing software (PostScript or PCL5 interpreters). This software also
    passes system messages from the imaging software to the appropri-
    ate print client and/or management client and provides remote man-
    agement services.

 o  Imaging software that interprets data from the communications soft-
    ware, builds the corresponding bitmaps, and sends those bitmaps to
    the print engine to be converted to printed output.

    The imaging software also passes any system messages from the print
    engine or interpreter to the communications software which, in turn,
    passes these messages to the appropriate print, remote management,
    and/or management clients running on client hosts.

    The imaging software includes an interpreter based on the Adobe[R]
    PostScript Page Description Language and resident typefaces. The
    PostScript level 1 interpreter includes 29 resident typefaces while
    the PostScript level 2 interpreter includes either 29 or 43 res-
    ident typefaces, depending on the memory configuration of the PrintServer
    17 printer. PostScript level 2 support is provided for the PrintServer
    17 family of printers in NetWare, OpenVMS, and ULTRIX operating en-
    vironments at this time. The resident typefaces are documented be-
    low.

 PostScript Compatibility Module

 At boot time, a PostScript compatibility module is automatically loaded
 into the PrintServer printer. The use of this file allows the correct
 emulation and printing of PostScript extensions found in other PostScript
 devices (e.g., Apple[R] LaserWriter[R]).

                                 28

 

 The PrintServer Software shall be installed on those processors listed
 above that meet the following criteria:

 o  Minimum of 12 MB of memory

 Note: In a Windows NT operating environment, a minimum of 16 MB of mem-
 ory is required.

 o  Ethernet controller interface

 o  TK50 or TK70 tape drive, CD-ROM drive, QIC cartridge tape drive,
    DAT tape drive, 3.5" floppy drive, or 5.25" floppy drive

 o  System disk

 o  SCSI Controller interface (Windows NT operating environments only)

 The PrintServer Software requires a minimum of one PrintServer printer
 (PrintServer 17, PrintServer 17/600, PrintServer 20, turbo PrintServer
 20, PrintServer 32, PrintGate/32, PrintServer 40, or PrintServer 40
 plus) to be connected to the Ethernet physical channel.

 PrintServer 20, turbo PrintServer 20, PrintServer 32, PrintGate/32,
 PrintServer 40, and PrintServer 40 plus printers require a transceiver
 cable and either an Ethernet transceiver (H4005) or the Local Network
 Interconnect (DELNI) or the ThinWire Ethernet Station Adapter (DECXM-
 AA).

 PrintServer 17 and PrintServer 17/600 printers allow for direct con-
 nection to thickwire and ThinWire Ethernet interfaces. With the op-
 tional communications card, the PrintServer 17 and PrintServer 17/600
 printers can be connected directly to ThinWire or Twisted Pair (10baseT)
 Ethernet. Please note that although both Ethernet cards (thick/ThinWire
 and Thin/Twisted Pair) have two interfaces, only one is active at a
 time.

 Note: A PrintServer printer cannot be booted over an INTERNET gateway.
