 PRODUCT NAME:   Digital Device Access Software for DASware V3.0 SPD
 60.46.01

 DESCRIPTION

 DASware is a general device connect product that contains the follow-
 ing Digital DAS modules:

 o  Device Access Software for RS232 (OpenVMS, Digital UNIX, Windows
    NT and HP-UX systems)

 o  Device Access Software for TCP/IP (Digital UNIX, Windows NT and HP-
    UX systems)

 o  Device Access Software for OSI Transport Layer (Digital UNIX and
    HP-UX systems)

 Each DASware module allows BASEstar Open users and DEComni API appli-
 cations to exchange data with partner applications or devices in a protocol-
 independent way through a specific Transport Network.

 Individual DASware modules do not implement protocols and services for
 the specific Transport Network. They provide a transport level inter-
 face to higher level applications which implement the specific pro-
 tocol for the device to be connected.

 The main function of a DASware module is to adapt the interface of the
 Transport Product specific to your platform to the BASEstar Open ser-
 vices and DEComni API.

                                                           July 1996

                                                         AE-4NGAA-TE

 

 BASEstar Open Data Services provide device-independent access to data
 allowing users to exchange data with partner applications or devices
 simply by getting and putting the value of one or more Device_Data_
 Points. DEComni API applications can perform the same functions through
 the DEComni MMS-oriented Application Programming Interface (API).

 DASware modules features cannot be accessed through the BASEstar Open
 Device services.
