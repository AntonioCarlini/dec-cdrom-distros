PRODUCT NAME:  VAX COBOL Version 5.4 for OpenVMS VAX Systems    SPD
25.04.28

DESCRIPTION

VAX COBOL is a high-level language for business data processing that
operates on the OpenVMS VAX Operating System, taking full advantage
of the system facilities. VAX COBOL is based upon the 1985 ANSI COBOL
Standard X3.23-1985 as modified by the X.23a-1989 amendment.

VAX COBOL has been validated at the high level by the National Bureau
of Standards for conformance to 'FIPS PUB 21-3, Federal Standard COBOL'.

The VAX COBOL Data Manipulation Language (DML), which is based upon
the report of the CODASYL Data Description Language Committee (1978),
allows users to write programs that access databases using the Oracle
DBMS database management system. Oracle DBMS must be installed to use
this feature.

VAX COBOL includes various DIGITAL extensions to COBOL, including screen
handling at the source language level, file sharing and record lock-
ing.

The following list of DIGITAL extensions to COBOL are implemented in
VAX COBOL:

o  Screen handling is implemented using the DISPLAY and ACCEPT state-
   ments. The DISPLAY statement enables the programmer to display in-
   formation or prompts anywhere on a video screen. The ACCEPT state-
   ment takes information typed anywhere on the screen and returns the
   value to a running VAX COBOL program. The DISPLAY statement con-
   verts data from internal numeric format to 'ASCII display format',
   and the ACCEPT WITH CONVERSION statement converts 'ASCII display'

                                                      February 1997

 

   input characters to internal numeric formats as appropriate. The
   terminal-type is recognized at run time from information provided
   by the operating system.

o  Many file capabilities are available through RMS including exten-
   sions for segmented keys, descending keys, and duplicate primary
   keys.

o  RMS-STS and RMS-STV and RMS-FILENAME special registers may be ex-
   amined to assist debugging. These registers contain status values
   from the Record Management System (OpenVMS RMS).

o  File sharing and record locking features enable more than one user
   to access data at the same time.

o  Conditional compilation serves to make debugging easier.

o  The /INSTRUCTION_SET qualifier customizes object code generation
   to target the different classes of VAX processors, maximizing spe-
   cific processor features.

o  The COPY FROM DICTIONARY statement allows access to common record
   definitions stored in the Oracle CDD/Repository. Oracle CDD/Repository
   must be installed to use this feature.

o  Terminal format recognition for program source files.

VAX COBOL implements several statements and extensions designed to make
programming easier in the OpenVMS for VAX environment:

o  CALL statement extensions: BY VALUE, BY DESCRIPTOR, OMITTED, and
   GIVING

o  VALUE IS EXTERNAL - Access to link time constants

o  USAGE IS POINTER - Address data type

o  VALUE IS REFERENCE - Compile time address evaluation

o  SET TO REFERENCE - Run time address evaluation

o  SUCCESS/FAILURE - Class conditions

o  Thirty-one-character user-names

                                 2

 

o  ACCEPT AT END statement

o  Single-quote-delimited, non-numeric literals

o  Hyphen/underscore equivalence in user-names

o  Non-numeric literal argument passing

The VAX COBOL compiler produces an object module from a source pro-
gram. The compiler is capable of producing a source listing with em-
bedded diagnostics including the line and column position in source-
code, a machine language listing, a file-name map, a data-name map,
a procedure-name map, an external program name map, database subschema
information, and a cross-reference listing. The cross-reference list-
ing and maps may be produced in either alphabetical order, or in or-
der of declaration. The cross-reference listing distinguishes updat-
ing references to data from read-only references.

VAX COBOL provides support for error diagnostics and cross-reference
information to DEC Language-Sensitive Editor/Source Code Analyzer. Ad-
ditionally, VAX COBOL provides support for the processing of pseudocode
and design comments that are used by the DEC Language-Sensitive Ed-
itor/Source Code Analyzer for low-level program design.

Object modules produced by the compiler can be linked with other ob-
ject modules produced by many other OpenVMS VAX languages, including
VAX BASIC and DEC Fortran. VAX COBOL is supported by both the Open-
VMS VAX Common Run Time Library (RTL) and the Symbolic Debugger for
OpenVMS VAX.

The VAX COBOL product includes a COBOL compiler and the REFORMAT util-
ity. The REFORMAT utility converts source programs from DIGITAL ter-
minal format to ANSI-standard COBOL format and vice versa.
