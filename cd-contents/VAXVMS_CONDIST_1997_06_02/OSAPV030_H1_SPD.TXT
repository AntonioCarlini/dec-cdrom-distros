           PRODUCT NAME:    DECosap/H1 Version 3.0                SPD 47.95.02
                           (Digital's Omni Services for SINEC Au-
                           tomation Protocols/SINEC H1 Services)

           DESCRIPTION

           DECosap is a network communication product. It provides a solution to
           connect Digital applications with shop floor devices based on 
           Siemens[R] SINEC[R] H1 communication protocol. SINEC H1 services 
           are also identified as PG communication services within Siemens 
           literature.

           Siemens SINEC H1 has been recommended for connecting PLCs and host 
           computers on large configurations. It has been specified on top of 
           the ISO/OSI Transport Layer and it is based on Ethernet to improve 
           effectiveness (through higher performance) and efficiency (through 
           lower costs per connection).

           DECosap/H1 for fully supports the SINEC H1 communication protocol.

           Features

           As SINEC H1 communication protocol is defined on top of the ISO OSI
           Transport Layer, DECosap relies upon DECnet/OSI to complete the com-
           munication stack. For more information, refer to the DECnet/OSI Soft-
           ware Product Description (SPD 41.92.xx).

           Because of the functional compatibility between Siemens SINEC AP and
           MMS (Manufacturing Messaging Services), ISO International Standard 
           9506, Parts 1 and 2, DECosap is integrated with the software 
           architecture of the DEComni API product to supply the Application 
           Programming Interface (API). For more information, refer to the 
           DEComni API Software Product Description (SPD 47.88.xx).

                                                                     July 1996

                                                                   AE-PZATB-TE

           (Digital's Omni Services for SINEC Automation Protocols/SINEC H1 Ser-
           vices)

           DECosap also provides Device Access Software (DAS) for connecting 
           Siemens SINEC H1 devices for BASEstar Open Server systems. For 
           further information, refer to the DEComni API Software Product 
           Description (SPD 47.82.xx).

           Components

           o  DECosap/H1 Services

           This component adds support for SINEC H1 functionality via the 
           DEComni API. Supported services are listed at the end of this 
           Software Product Description and are divided into the following 
           categories:

              -  Environmental Management

              -  Messages Exchange

              -  Device Management

              -  Variable Access

           o  Configuration and Management Facilities

           DECosap/H1 uses the DEComni API facility ODSCL.

           On OpenVMS platforms, the following DEComni API facilities are sup-
           ported:

              -  ODF (Omni Definition Facility)

              -  OmniView

           o  Support for the Device Access Services of BASEstar Open

           o  Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)

           The DECosap IVP performs a series of tests to verify proper instal-
           lation.
