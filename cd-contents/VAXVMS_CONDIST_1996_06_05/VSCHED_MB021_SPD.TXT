          PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER Scheduler, Version 2.1B      SPD 32.19.05

          DESCRIPTION

          POLYCENTER Scheduler is a layered software product which automates
          the execution of production or background jobs on multivendor 
          platforms.  Jobs, which can consist of single line commands or 
          multiple sequential commands contained within shell scripts or 
          procedures, can be scheduled to run on a given schedule as well 
          as in synchronization with other jobs.  In addition, POLYCENTER 
          Scheduler manages the load leveling, job execution, monitoring, 
          notification, and maintains the order of sequence that jobs which 
          depend on others need to run in.

          POLYCENTER Scheduler consists of two components: a SERVER and an
          AGENT.  The server manages the job run schedule as well as the data 
          repositories in which job run information and history logs are 
          maintained.  The server also determines the best systems to use 
          at run time to optimize load leveling, ensure the synchronization 
          of job run sequences and provide failover and recovery in the case 
          of system or job failures. The agents, which are supported on 
          multivendor platforms, are installed on each system that need to 
          run jobs. The design of the Server/Agent architecture makes 
          POLYCENTER Scheduler scaleable and supportive of client/server 
          environments, and allows the management and synchronization of 
          job processes across platforms and the network.

          POLYCENTER Scheduler supports the Server component on the following
          platforms:

          o  OpenVMS AXP (POLYCENTER Scheduler OpenVMS AXP)

          o  OpenVMS VAX (POLYCENTER Scheduler OpenVMS VAX)



                                        DIGITAL                  January 1995

                                                                  AE-PBJ7F-TE
