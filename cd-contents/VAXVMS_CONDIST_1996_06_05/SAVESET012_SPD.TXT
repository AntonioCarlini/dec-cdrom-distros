 PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER Save Set Manager for OpenVMS, Version 1.2,
 SPD 62.64.04

 DESCRIPTION

 The POLYCENTER Save Set Manager for OpenVMS (SSMgr) is a layered soft-
 ware product that reduces user time spent on save set operations. The
 SSMgr reduces operational time spent during OpenVMS BACKUP operations
 by providing an avenue for offline save set validation, copy, and save
 set merge functions.

 The key benefits of the POLYCENTER Save Set Manager for OpenVMS are:

 o  Reduction of operational time spent on online backup and restore
    without compromising data integrity

 o  Selective manipulation of save set contents and attributes

 o  Transfer of backup save sets between tape drive technologies

 o  Transfer of backup save sets from one tape or disk drive to another
    tape or disk drive while maintaining data integrity features

 o  Reduced down time for a BACKUP/RESTORE operation

 o  Ability to monitor degradation of archived save sets

 o  Wildcard support

 o  Backup journal file creation

                                                        January 1996

                                                         AE-QDKPE-TE

 

 There are three separate and distinct functions in the SSMgr, Version
 1.2. They are:

 1. Save Set VALIDATE-This function validates the internal consistency
    of a specified save set offline and reports any exceptions back to
    the user.

 2. Save Set COPY-This function provides the ability to duplicate the
    save set with the addition/deletion of CRC or XOR blocks in the out-
    put save set and eliminates any duplicate records.

 3. Save Set MERGE-This function provides the ability to merge incre-
    mental save sets with other incremental or full save sets, reduc-
    ing the frequency of full BACKUP operations.

    OpenVMS Alpha Operating System SPD (41.87.xx)

 A minimum system configuration to run Save Set Manager (SSMgr) includes:

 o  Recommended: Same or greater amount of memory as the system on which
    the save sets were originally created

 o  One or more disk or tape drives supported by OpenVMS

 Processor Restrictions:

 Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1):

 Disk space required for    3000 blocks
 installation:

                                  2
