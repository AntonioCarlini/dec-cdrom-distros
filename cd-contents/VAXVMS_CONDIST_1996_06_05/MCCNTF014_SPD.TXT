          PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER Framework Notification Option, Version 1.4
          SPD 39.75.03                (formerly DECmcc Notification Package)

          INTRODUCTION

          POLYCENTER Framework Notification Option is one of several separately
          available packages of POLYCENTER Network Management Modules. These
          products provide management functions and protocol support for
          different network and system management environments. POLYCENTER
          Network Management Module Options can be installed and used
          separately or in any combination with the POLYCENTER Framework. The
          management services provided by newly installed modules are
          automatically enrolled in the POLYCENTER Framework and are available
          to management services already installed.

          POLYCENTER Framework software is the minimum prerequisite software
          product for POLYCENTER Network Management Module Options such as the
          Notification Option. Please refer to the POLYCENTER Network
          Management Services Software Product Description (SPD 37.20.xx) for a
          list of the POLYCENTER Network Management products and module options,
          and for a description of their relationship to each other and to the
          Digital Enterprise Management Architecture (EMA).

          DESCRIPTION

          The POLYCENTER Framework Notification Option consists of Management
          Modules that provide alarm and notification functions. It enables
          users to define states or conditions that must be monitored for fault
          management.

                                                                  AE-PUCCE-TE

 



          POLYCENTER Framework Notification Option, Version 1.4 SPD 39.75.03
          (formerly DECmcc Notification Package)

          Users can write alarm rules for any managed object or, with wildcard-
          ing, multiple objects in the same class, for which there is a corre-
          sponding Access Module (AM). Alarm rules can be based on state
          changes, simple arithmetic expressions, or occurrences (unsolicited
          events). Users can request notifications of events such as alarm
          firing, DECnet events, SNMP traps, and data collector events. Users
          can direct notification to icons representing devices other than the
          device generating the event.

          There are a number of operator notification methods available, includ-
          ing:

          o  An Event/Alarm Log and a Notification Window that allow users to
             define event or alarm conditions they want to view and save. With
             the Notification Window, users can set up event filters, store and
             display event or alarm messages, and obtain additional detail as
             needed. Users can search for and display messages by specifying
             severity level, date and time, managed object, and keywords.

          o  Map notification within the Motif/Iconic Map PM. This function
             allows users to set up notifications within the iconic map that
             change the color of an icon or icons. Users can assign specific
             colors to severity levels and select defaults that display either
             the most recent or the most severe alarms.

          o  Trigger ULTRIX shell scripts or OpenVMS DCL command procedures.
             With such procedures, users can set up notification methods
             including terminal broadcast messages or electronic mail. In
             addition, fault isolation, testing, recovery, and other common
             operator functions can be automated using command procedures
             triggered by alarm rules.

          CLUSTER ENVIRONMENT

          This layered product is fully supported when installed on any valid
          and licensed VAXcluster* configuration without restrictions. The
          HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS section details any special hardware required by
          this product.

          *  V5.x VAXcluster configurations are fully described in the VAXclus-
             ter Software Product Description (29.78.xx) and include CI, Eth-
             ernet, and Mixed Interconnect configurations.

          IMPORTANT INTEROPERABILITY INFORMATION FOR OPENVMS USERS ONLY

          Interoperability problems may occur when more than one product con-
          taining DECthreads is installed on a system. This occurs because some
          products overwrite the system version of DECthreads. If a product with
          a different version of DECthreads is installed after POLYCENTER Frame-
          work, problems may occur.

          POLYCENTER Framework V1.4 is linked with DECthreads V1.0-422. Later
          versions of DECthreads have a backwards compatible API. Consequently,
          no problem should result from having a more recent version of
          DECthreads on the system.

          Only SSB versions of DECthreads are supported.
