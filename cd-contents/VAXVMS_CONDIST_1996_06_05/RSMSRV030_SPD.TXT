 PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER Software Distribution,     SPD 29.59.05
                Version 3.0

 DESCRIPTION

 POLYCENTER Software Distribution (PSD) is an OpenVMS and ULTRIX lay-
 ered product that permits a system manager to manage a number of com-
 puter systems efficiently.

 PSD uses the DECnet network to automate the recurring system manage-
 ment tasks of:

 o  Software distribution and installation - both operating systems (Open-
    VMS AXP and OpenVMS VAX only) and applications (all Clients)

 o  File backup and restore

 o  System administration (OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS AXP systems)

 For flexibility in configuration, the clients and servers of PSD are
 available as separately licensed products:

 o  OpenVMS VAX Server

 o  OpenVMS AXP Server

 o  OpenVMS VAX Client

 o  OpenVMS AXP Client

 o  ULTRIX VAX Client

 o  ULTRIX RISC Client

 POLYCENTER Software Distribution OpenVMS Server

                               DIGITAL                      May 1994

                                                         AE-LB72F-TE

 

 The Server software runs on OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS AXP and maintains
 Client software and administrative information, maintains libraries
 of application software, directs the installation of software, sched-
 ules file backups, and receives file backups.

 Additionally, for OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS AXP Clients, the Server pro-
 vides remote maintenance of user accounts, directories, DECnet prox-
 ies, licenses, and libraries of operating systems.

 The Server license includes the right to install the OpenVMS Client
 on the same node.

 Server software can be installed on a cluster and configured to use
 the distributed resources available to all nodes that share the clus-
 ter alias. Alternatively, the Server software can be configured to op-
 erate on a single, specified node in the cluster. Configuring the Server
 for operation on a single cluster-member restricts the use of PSD and
 the associated workload to a single node.

 Configuring the Server for full VMScluster system operation allows more
 efficient use of cluster-wide resources, providing redundancy and load
 balancing with minimum manager preparation and effort. In this con-
 figuration, all members of the cluster who share the cluster alias will
 share the work.

 Typical networks would have one or more PSD Servers, each serving a
 number of Clients. It is possible to have multiple Servers for a given
 set of Clients. In such a case, one Server is designated for manage-
 ment operations and the others are Software Library Servers or Backup
 Target Servers, or combination Software Library/Backup Target Servers.

 POLYCENTER Software Distribution OpenVMS Clients

 These products provide OpenVMS systems with the ability to receive soft-
 ware, including operating systems, distributed from a PSD Server. They
 also permit files to be backed up to and restored from a Server.

 POLYCENTER Software Distribution ULTRIX Clients


                                  2

 

 These products provide ULTRIX systems with the ability to receive soft-
 ware distributed from a PSD Server. Operating systems cannot be in-
 stalled on ULTRIX Clients. These products also permit files to be backed
 up to and restored from a Server.

 Features

 Software Distribution and Installation

 The Software Distribution Services (SDS) component of the PSD Server
 installs software on Clients. PSD stores copies of applications for
 both OpenVMS and ULTRIX and operating systems for OpenVMS systems in
 a library on the Server, and uses the DECnet network to distribute soft-
 ware automatically to the Client during the installation process.

 Note: Software that is installed using SDS remains subject to any li-
 censing restrictions associated with that software.

 Application Software Installation

 PSD provides users with the ability to take applications from a li-
 brary Server and install those applications on one or more Clients.
 Application software is installed on the Client using the standard in-
 stallation utility for that system (for OpenVMS systems, VMSINSTAL or
 POLYCENTER Software Installation (PCSI); for ULTRIX systems, setld).

 An Application Sets feature provides for the creation and manipula-
 tion of "sets" of related applications. The concept of Application Sets
 makes performing operations on an entire set of applications as easy
 as performing operations on a single application.

 PSD provides users with the ability to manage and enforce application
 prerequisites. Applications may be stored in the library along with
 information on the software prerequisites for the application. Upon
 request to install an application, PSD automatically verifies that it
 has installed all of the software prerequisites on the Client. If any
 prerequisite software is not present on the Client, PSD automatically
 installs it.

 Restrictions

                                  3

 

 For OpenVMS:

 SDS can install any OpenVMS application that can be installed using
 the VMSINSTAL utility or the PCSI utility and conforms to the follow-
 ing rules:

 o  The application's installation procedure must conform to the guide-
    lines presented in the OpenVMS Developer's Guide to VMSINSTAL or
    the POLYCENTER Software Installation Utility Developer's Guide.

 o  The application must be installable while VMSINSTAL or PCSI is run-
    ning as a noninteractive process. In addition, the application must
    be installable using a VMSINSTAL auto-answer file or a PCSI con-
    figuration file.

 SDS executes VMSINSTAL or PCSI as a detached process. Therefore, any
 application installation procedure that performs terminal-related ac-
 tivities (such as SET TERMINAL) or modifies its execution based on pro-
 cess mode (such as INTERACTIVE or BATCH) may fail.

 The application installation procedure must not depend on local con-
 ditions such as node name or pre-existing files.

 For ULTRIX:

 SDS can install any ULTRIX application that can be installed using the
 setld utility. The setld program does not permit the installation of
 subsets that cannot fit into the available disk space.

 Application subset naming has changed as of ULTRIX V4.0. The version
 labeling used by SDS supports only this new naming convention. ULTRIX
 applications present in SDS libraries prior to RSM V2.3 will not work;
 however, applications prior to ULTRIX V4.0 can be reinstalled if needed
 with a modified use of the subset version naming.

 All NFS file systems should be dismounted before using setld with the
 -a, -d, and -l options.

 Operating System Software Installation - OpenVMS (VAX and AXP Clients
 Only)

                                  4

 

 PSD can install an OpenVMS operating system on a PSD Client. Using this
 capability, managers of PSD Servers can take a VAX, VAXstation, Mi-
 croVAX, VAXserver, AXP Workstation, AXP Server, or AXP system, con-
 nect it to an Ethernet network, and have a preconfigured operating sys-
 tem transmitted over the Ethernet and installed on the PSD Client.

 The system manager selects a FETCHed operating system from the SDS li-
 brary for downloading; it must be a version of OpenVMS that supports
 the system to be initial system loaded (ISLed). Once designated for
 ISLing, the Client is booted from the Ethernet and the Client system
 is downloaded.

 Restrictions

 For the installation of operating system software, both the PSD Server
 and its Client must be on the same Local Area Network, or a copy of
 the operating system software image must reside on an InfoServer or
 local disk drive (such as a CD-ROM player) on the same LAN as the Client.

 File Backup and Restore

 The Backup and Restore Services (BRS) component provides scheduled file
 backups from PSD Clients to PSD Servers. BRS also has the ability to
 restore files that it backed up.

 Backups are scheduled by creating a Server database entry for each backup
 task required for each Client. This entry defines all of the attributes
 of the backup task, such as the frequency of the backup (daily, weekly,
 monthly), the style of backup (incremental or full), the files to be
 backed up, and whether to store the backed up data on disk or tape.

 Restrictions

 When restoring to a Client from a tape backup, POLYCENTER Software Dis-
 tribution copies the information to be restored to a Server disk prior
 to transferring this information to the Client. There must be suffi-
 cient disk space on the Server for this operation.

 In order for PSD to perform an image restore of a Client, that Client
 must have at least two writable storage devices.

                                  5

 

 For ULTRIX:

 Backups on ULTRIX systems use the native backup utilities (dump and
 tar) in multiuser mode, and these utilities are subject to certain lim-
 itations. Specifically, any user or system activity that modifies files
 while they are being backed up may corrupt the backup. Digital rec-
 ommends that non-image backups be performed whenever possible, because
 during non-image backups PSD uses the tar utility, which is less vul-
 nerable to corruption problems.

 System Administration

 The Client Administrative Services (CAS) component of the PSD Server
 provides remote management of user accounts, directories, and prox-
 ies on OpenVMS Clients. It provides a mechanism for maintaining con-
 sistent logical names, symbol names, and DECnet node names across the
 set of Clients. Also, it maintains and distributes OpenVMS license in-
 formation for Clients and checks security of DECnet and guest accounts
 on Clients.

 Restrictions

 There is no command line interface to this component of PSD.

 Additional Features

 Multiple Server Type

 Each PSD environment contains one and only one Management Server. The
 Management Server performs centralized PSD operation while other servers
 may contain the SDS library or receive backup output files. While no
 architectural limitations exist on the number of other Servers the Man-
 agement Server can use, practical considerations influence the per-
 formance of the Management Server. A general suggestion for maintain-
 ing satisfactory performance is to configure a maximum of four other
 Servers to assist the Management Server.

 Menu and Command Line User Interface


                                  6

 

 This version of PSD supports both a menu-style and a command line in-
 terface. The menu interface helps the user to correctly structure PSD
 command lines.

 Groups

 In many situations, a number of computer systems perform similar tasks.
 These systems typically use the same software and can operate on the
 same backup schedule. PSD's Group feature permits all of these sys-
 tems to be referenced by a single group name. An operation on a Group
 is performed on each system in the group.

 Management of LMF licenses

 PSD provides the ability to create and maintain an OpenVMS License Man-
 agement database on the Management Server for each OpenVMS Client. PSD
 can then transmit this database to the OpenVMS Client and install it
 as a Secondary LMF Database. This feature is supported only for Open-
 VMS Clients (VAX and AXP).

 Configuration

 PSD supports a single level of Server hierarchy. Therefore, each POLYCENTER
 Software Distribution environment must contain one and only one Man-
 agement Server. While no architectural limitations exist on the num-
 ber of clients any Server can serve, practical considerations such as
 Server processor type and available disk space influence Server per-
 formance. A general suggestion for maintaining satisfactory perfor-
 mance is to configure the Management Server to serve a maximum of ap-
 proximately 40 clients. If you use several Management Servers, par-
 tition the Client population into distinct management domains, with
 one management domain for each Management Server.

 Other Servers are Target Servers, Library Servers, combined Target and
 Library Servers, or any combination of these. You can add as many other
 Servers as you need.




                                  7

 

 PSD uses extensively the facilities provided by the operating system
 on which it runs and is highly dependent upon the configuration of the
 base operating system. You must maintain operating system files where
 they were placed during installation. Also, search lists should not
 be created which prevent PSD from accessing these files in the stan-
 dard locations. All modifications to operating system data files (i.e.,
 DECnet databases, user authorization files, etc.) should be done us-
 ing the operating system provided utilities or as described in the ap-
 propriate documentation.

 SOFTWARE LICENSING

 The licensing terms are based on ClusterWide licensing in which the
 license applies to a purchase power rating rather than a specific CPU.
 Customers continue to receive the right-to-use software on nodes within
 a cluster system. The PSD Server must be licensed on all members of
 the VMScluster system that share the cluster alias. In this case, the
 VMScluster license would be restricted to the rating purchased rather
 than the total rating of the VMScluster system, unless the entire VM-
 Scluster system shared the cluster alias.

 This software is furnished only under a license. For more information
 about Digital's licensing terms and policies, contact your local Dig-
 ital office.

 License Management Facility Support

 The PSD OpenVMS VAX Server, PSD OpenVMS Client, and PSD ULTRIX/RISC
 Client layered products support the OpenVMS License Management Facil-
 ity.

 appropriate operating system Software Product Description or documen-
 tation.
