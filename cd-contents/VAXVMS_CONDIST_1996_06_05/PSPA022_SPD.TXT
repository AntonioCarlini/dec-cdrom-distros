DESCRIPTION

POLYCENTER Performance Advisor for OpenVMS

Performance Knowledge Base and Rules Compiler

The POLYCENTER Performance Advisor for OpenVMS contains a knowledge
base of rules and thresholds that it uses to analyze OpenVMS system
data collected by the POLYCENTER Performance Data Collector on VAX and
Alpha systems. These factory rules cover five categories: memory, CPU,
I/O, cluster, and miscellaneous.

The knowledge base can be modified and expanded by the user. To in-
tegrate new rules, modify existing rules, or turn off rules, the user
creates an auxiliary knowledge base. For system analysis, the user can
load the auxiliary knowledge base to augment the factory rules.

The POLYCENTER Performance Advisor produces an analysis report that
aids the system manager in monitoring system activities and in mak-
ing performance evaluations by quickly identifying performance prob-
lems. Through its analysis, POLYCENTER Performance Advisor also iden-
tifies potential bottlenecks and the specific device on which the bot-
tleneck may occur.

                                 2

 

The POLYCENTER Performance Advisor reports are generated at the re-
quest of the user and include the Analysis Report, Brief Analysis Re-
port, Performance Evaluation Report, Tabular Report, Graphs, and Pie
Charts. The POLYCENTER Performance Advisor reports can be generated
from either daily or historical data. All reports can be accessed through
a Motif[R] interface.

RealTime Displays

A DECwindows Motif interface provides customizable displays consist-
ing of a set of instrument panels. The instrument panels can contain
any combination of bar graphs, strip charts, or meters. A set of de-
fault instrument panels are predefined for viewing OpenVMS system per-
formance statistics. The user can define display panels, organizing
the presentation of real-time data according to local needs.

A character cell interface provides performance monitoring of several
activity levels: system, process, disk, user, and image. This inter-
face also supports a number of ReGIS displays for viewing system-level
activity.

Both real-time displays have the ability to "play back" performance
data stored in collection files. This allows interaction analysis of
what events may have lead to a problem situation.

Analysis Reports

The POLYCENTER Performance Advisor Analysis Report provides conclu-
sions and recommendations for improving system performance. The Anal-
ysis Report also contains the conditions under which the identified
problems occurred, along with supporting time-stamped evidence to sub-
stantiate the conclusions. The Analysis Report is generated from daily
data files and, therefore, is most useful for daily, hourly, and weekly
system performance analysis.

A Brief Analysis Report identifies the rules that fired during the anal-
ysis period and provides a one-line synopsis of the problem.

Graphs and Pie Charts

                                 3

 

The POLYCENTER Performance Advisor provides a facility to represent
graphically the data collected in the Performance Solution database
by the Performance Data Collector. The Performance Advisor provides
the system manager with a visual representation of the system's per-
formance metrics. This robust source of information can provide a bet-
ter understanding of resource utilization and overall workload demands.

A wide range of predefined graphs and pie charts are provided along
with the ability to define custom graphs. Graphs can be created in var-
ious output formats, including DECwindows, ReGIS, ANSI, PostScript[R],
CSV (comma-separated variables), and tabular output. Pie charts can
be created in DECwindows and PostScript, CSV (comma-separated vari-
ables), and tabular output.

System data for selected periods of time can be graphed using either
daily or history data, an effective way to study the long term per-
formance trends of standalone and clustered systems.

Callable Interface

The POLYCENTER Performance Advisor provides data extraction procedures
that can be called from user-written programs. This facility allows
system and application programmers to call library procedures for ex-
traction of daily or real-time data. It also provides record defini-
tions for the following languages: DEC Ada for OpenVMS VAX Systems,
DEC Ada for OpenVMS Alpha Systems, DEC BASIC, VAX BASIC, VAX BLISS-
32, BLISS-32EN, VAX C, DEC C for OpenVMS Alpha, DEC FORTRAN for Open-
VMS, VAX LISP, MACRO, Pascal for OpenVMS, VAX PL/I and DEC PL/I for
OpenVMS Alpha.

Export Facility

This facility, available from DCL, simplifies the conversion of Data
Collector daily and history data to binary or ASCII flat files. The
binary file must be used with DATATRIEVE for any subsequent analysis.
The ASCII data file can be produced in either CSV (comma-separated vari-
ables) or DATATRIEVE format.

Performance Evaluation and Tabular Reports

                                 4

 

The Performance Evaluation and Tabular Reports provide system and pro-
cess statistics to assist the system manager in gauging the impact of
changes made to the system. They are particularly useful in compar-
ing system performance after implementation of a Performance Advisor
recommendation. These reports provide summaries of disk and tape ac-
tivity, CPU and memory utilization, as well as detailed statistics on
all process activity. Performance Evaluation and Tabular Reports are
generated from either daily or history data. Specifically, these re-
ports provide summary information on:

o  Process statistics in customizable formats

o  Locking traffic

o  Paging

o  File activity and caching

o  Tables of SCS data

o  Disk utilization

o  Tape activity

o  CPU and memory usage

o  Pool resources by node

o  Hot file activity

o  System level statistics

o  Terminal response time
