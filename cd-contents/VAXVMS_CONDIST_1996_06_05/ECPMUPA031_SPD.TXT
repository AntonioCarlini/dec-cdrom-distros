PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER Capacity Planner,            SPD 36.04.07
               Version 3.1

OVERVIEW OF THE PRODUCT FAMILY

POLYCENTER Performance Solution is a family of OpenVMS and Digital UNIX
layered products that reduces the time and effort required to manage
and monitor system performance, as well as plan for future resource
requirements. The POLYCENTER Performance Solution products can be used
with standalone OpenVMS VAX, OpenVMS AXP, Digital UNIX[R], and clus-
tered systems.

The POLYCENTER Performance Solution products (formerly known as DECper-
formance Solution, or DECps) include:

o  POLYCENTER Capacity Planner predicts OpenVMS and Digital UNIX sys-
   tem performance levels for various workloads and configurations.
   It is described in this SPD.

o  POLYCENTER Performance Data Collector for OpenVMS gathers and man-
   ages OpenVMS and system data (see SPD 36.02.xx).

o  POLYCENTER Performance Data Collector for UNIX[R] gathers and man-
   ages Digital UNIX and other UNIX system data (see SPD 46.97.xx).

o  POLYCENTER Performance Advisor for OpenVMS analyzes OpenVMS data
   through the application of expert system technology. It identifies
   specific performance problems, presents detailed supporting evi-
   dence, and makes recommendations to improve system performance (see
   SPD 36.03.xx).

o  POLYCENTER Performance Advisor for UNIX analyzes UNIX data through
   the application of expert system technology.

o  POLYCENTER Accounting Chargeback for OpenVMS VAX generates a re-
   port of charges based on OpenVMS system resource utilization and
   user specified resource pricing (see SPD 36.60.xx).

DESCRIPTION

POLYCENTER Capacity Planner

The POLYCENTER Capacity Planner modeling component is used to predict
the performance of standalone OpenVMS VAX, OpenVMS AXP, Digital UNIX,
and clustered systems, and to determine system performance levels for
various workloads and configurations. Performance calculations are based
on queuing theory and analytic models.

The modeling component includes a graphical modeling interface from
which "what-if" analyses can be performed. A baseline model is cre-
ated from information collected by the POLYCENTER Performance Data Col-
lectors. This baseline model becomes the starting point for assess-
ing the impact of changes to the configuration or the workloads. Users
can add, delete, or change any hardware component or workload, and ex-
amine the impact on performance by viewing various performance met-
rics, such as: utilization, response times, throughput, queue length,
and service time. Models can be saved for further evaluation. The "what-
if" analyses form the foundation of capacity plans.

The POLYCENTER Capacity Planner allows the system manager or planner
to define the system's total workload in terms of manageable units.
Workloads are expressed as classes that include groups of processes
(for both OpenVMS and UNIX with similar characteristics). These classes
are used in model generation. Workload classes can be defined accord-
ing to users, UICs, process name, account name, and process mode. Sub-
classes are a set of transactions under a class. These may be images
if the images function as transactions. Workloads are thus able to be
expressed as a class/subclass table for transaction performance statis-
tics. UNIX subclasses are not supported since a process runs one and
only one image (command).




                                 2

 

The POLYCENTER Capacity Planner provides performance information for
each supported CPU, HSC, disk, channel, adapter, bridge, router, and
interconnect at both current and projected workloads or configurations.
This includes support for OpenVMS volume shadowing and disk striping
(but not above RAID-1 level).

The POLYCENTER Capacity Planner supports the following network pro-
tocols:

o  SCS

o  NSP/DECnet

o  OSI/DECnet

o  TCP/IP

o  UDP/IP

o  LAT

The network subsystem, as it pertains to system-based capacity plan-
ning, is the set of network components and protocols for which com-
munications of workload traverses selected network path(s) over all
capacity planning end-node pairs. The modeling focus of the network
subsystem is to support end-to-end response time modeling, network de-
vice performance, and client/server capacity planning (extended LAN
support, and WAN).

Client/server support is provided in that software servers may be de-
fined to serve one or more clients. Multiple levels of software servers
are allowed. POLYCENTER Capacity Planner will support capacity plan-
ning for environments that include applications whose client/server
components are implemented on multiple CPUs.

The performance statistics are provided in either summary or detailed
table reports, as well as graph reports, and include:

o  Resource utilization

o  Response time

o  Throughput

                                 3

 

o  Queue length

o  Service time

In addition to their reporting functions, graph reports allow you to
perform modeling activities such as user load balancing in a dynamic,
visual manner.

POLYCENTER Capacity Planner provides prediction reporting that indi-
cates the workload size at which a component will saturate. The re-
port shows the system performance at incremental increases of work-
load up to the saturation point. The increment steps are 25 percent
of initial component utilization. After an increase to 100 percent,
only the saturation point is shown.

The saturation analysis identifies bottlenecks before they occur, al-
lowing the system manager to be proactive in eliminating bottlenecks
and providing a consistent level of system performance to users.

Features

POLYCENTER Capacity Planner provides the user with the capabilities
to plan effectively for future computer resource needs:

o  A graphical modeling interface provides an easy-to-use tool for per-
   forming multiple "what-if" analyses.

o  Work performed by OpenVMS and Digital UNIX systems can be grouped
   into meaningful categories.

POLYCENTER Capacity Planner has two portions: the Modeler/Characterizer
and the Data Integrator. The Data Integrator compresses performance
data collected from one or more nodes by Data Collectors. The Modeler
/Characterizer provides the following functions:

o  Performance modeling is supported for standalone systems with the
   above operating systems and clustered systems.

o  "What-if" analysis provides performance characteristics of the sys-
   tem before actual changes are implemented.

                                 4

 

o  Built-in configuration rules assist in modeling and validating sup-
   ported configurations.

o  Saturation analysis identifies the workload at which system com-
   ponents will saturate and performance bottlenecks will occur.

o  CPU priority modeling is supported.

o  Extended LAN protocols and components are supported.

o  WAN protocols and components are supported.

o  Client/server application environments are supported.

o  Modeling for clients (PCs) that talk to a OpenVMS VAX or OpenVMS
   AXP system using Pathworks is supported.

o  Context-sensitive Help is available.

o  All hardware that runs OpenVMS or Digital UNIX can be modelled.

Processors That Can Be Modeled

Any number of user-defined CPUs can be modeled.

Disk space required for     13,000 blocks
use (permanent):            (7.0 MB)

These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk where
appropriate. The sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depend-
ing on the user's system environment, configuration, and software op-
tions.

For installation and permanent disk requirements for the performance
data collectors, refer to SPD 36.02.xx for POLYCENTER Performance Data
Collector for OpenVMS and to SPD 46.97.xx for POLYCENTER Performance
Data Collector for UNIX.
