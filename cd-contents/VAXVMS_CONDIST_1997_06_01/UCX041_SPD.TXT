           DESCRIPTION

           The Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS (TCP/IP) product is a layered
           software product that provides interoperability and resource sharing
           among OpenVMS systems, UNIX[R] systems, and other systems that sup-
           port the TCP/IP Protocol Suite and the NFS[TM] product from Sun[R] Mi-
           crosystems.

           Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS provides mail, network file ac-
           cess, remote terminal access, remote command execution, remote print-
           ing, and application development.

           A lower cost version of Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS, identi-
           fied as a client, is available for users who do not require the full
           complement of features available in the Digital TCP/IP Services for
           OpenVMS product. The client license includes the functionality of the
           server license with the exception of the following server components:
           the NFS server, the BIND server, the PC-NFS server, and the remote BOOT
           server.

           Customers who require the full server functionality should purchase
           the server license. A Digital TCP/IP client upgrade license is avail-
           able for any customer who purchased a client license and now requires
           full product functionality.

           NEW FEATURES

           POP Server

           The Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS POP server is an OpenVMS im-
           plementation of the Post Office Protocol, Version 3 (RFC 1725), and
           is based on the Indiana University POP server Version 1.8 (IUPOP3).
           A POP client is not included in the current implementation. POP is a
           mail repository used mostly by PCs to ensure that mail is accepted and
           stored even when the PC is turned off. The POP implementation is in-
           tended for use with the SMTP server provided with Digital TCP/IP Ser-
           vices for OpenVMS.

           SNMP Extensible Agent (eSNMP)

           Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS provides support for network man-
           agement with the Extensible SNMP
           (eSNMP) software. Extensibility means that an agent can support mul-
           tiple subagents. The current implementation has one agent, two sub-
           agents, and an applications programming interface (API). The subagents
           provide support for RFC 1213 (MIB-II) and partial support for RFC 1514
           (Host Resource MIB).

           FINGER Command

           The FINGER command displays information about users on the system.

           FTP Command: VIEW

           The VIEW command displays the contents of a file on the current out-
           put device.

           NFS Server Enhancement: File Naming

           You can create files and directories in an OpenVMS file system using
           names that do not conform to OpenVMS file-naming rules. This feature
           allows you to create files with case-sensitive names, or names con-
           taining characters that do not conform to OpenVMS syntax, without us-
           ing a container file system.

           NFS Server Support for XQP+

           NFS supports access to XQP+, the eXtended QIO Processor file system
           introduced in OpenVMS Version 6.1. The XQP+ performance enhancements
           are especially beneficial for NFS servers that are handling a heavy
           load.

           FEATURES

           Installation and Configuration

           You install the Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS product using the
           VMSINSTAL utility (for VAX systems) or the POLYCENTER Software Instal-
           lation utility (for Alpha systems).

           For configuration ease, Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS provides
           a menu-driven configuration procedure. Using this procedure, you con-
           figure only those services and applications you plan to use. You con-
           figure all client software components quickly, without needing to se-
           lect individual menu options.

           Communications

           Communications are based on Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) Ver-
           sion 4.3 and implement the following protocols and features:

           o  Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

           o  Internet Protocol (IP)

           o  Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)

           Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS Version 4.1       SPD 46.46.05


           o  Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

           o  User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

           o  Routing Information Protocol (RIP)

           o  Ethernet support

           o  FDDI support

           o  Auxiliary (AUX) Server (INETd), plus enhancements such as security
              and event logging

           Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) Support

           FDDI is an ANSI standard for a network technology based on fiber op-
           tics. It specifies a 100-megabit-per-second transmission rate. Dig-
           ital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS allows OpenVMS systems to take ad-
           vantage of this technology by enabling TCP/IP communications with hosts
           in the following configurations:

           o  On the same FDDI network

           o  Over an FDDI/Ethernet bridge

           o  Through a router

           OpenVMS hosts are also able to act as an internet gateway between FDDI
           networks and Ethernet networks.

           The management of the FDDI controller is integrated with the TCP/IP
           network management interface.

           Auxiliary Server (INETd)

           The INETd software is the TCP/IP service dispatcher for UNIX systems
           that was originally provided by Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD)
           Version 4.3.

           This feature greatly simplifies application writing and manages over-
           head by reducing the number of simultaneous server processes on the
           system.

           Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS Version 4.1       SPD 46.46.05


           The Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS implementation of INETd per-
           forms the following functions:

           o  Listens for incoming connection requests and starts application ser-
              vices. Controls dynamic process creation in the same manner as does
              the UNIX-based INETd.

           o  Provides a database of services.

           o  Provides security features.

           o  Offers event logging.

           BIND Server

           The BIND server translates the Domain Name System (DNS) host names into
           IP addresses. Network managers can set up a BIND database to config-
           ure primary, secondary, and caching servers on OpenVMS hosts. This fea-
           ture complements the BIND resolver, which is the client component of
           BIND that requests node-name-to-address translations from a BIND server.

           Remote Booting

           The remote booting feature allows remote host booting of diskless clients
           using OpenVMS as the boot server. Remote booting uses BOOTP (Bootstrap
           Protocol) and TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) to initiate the
           boot request and download the boot files.

           UCX Management With Command-line Interface

           UCX Management provides DCL-style commands to control and monitor the
           TCP/IP software components.

           Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Agent

           SNMP is the Internet standard protocol for network management over TCP
           /IP. The SNMP agent communicates with network management directors to
           provide information about network activity. The MIB-II variables (RFC
           1213) and a portion of the Host Resource MIB (RFC 1514) are supported
           within SNMP.

           Security and Network Access Control

           System managers use network security features to control access to Open-
           VMS systems from remote internet hosts.

           Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)

           Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS includes the following applica-
           tion programming interfaces:

           -  A C-socket programming interface (the Berkeley socket programming
              interface) used to develop TCP/IP networking applications in the
              C language

           -  A QIO programming interface used to develop TCP/IP networking ap-
              plications in any OpenVMS language

           -  A SRIQIO interface

           -  The Sun[R] remote procedure calls (Sun RPC) library, included in
              the Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS programming interface (in-
              cludes RPC function calls, the Portmapper module, and external data
              representation (XDR) routines)

           Applications

           The applications component includes numerous end-user protocols for
           file transfer, remote login, remote command processing, remote print-
           ing, and mail exchange, as follows:

           o  File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

           FTP is the internet application protocol for file transfer that en-
           ables users to transfer files to and from remote hosts.

           o  Telnet

           Telnet is the internet application protocol for remote login that en-
           ables OpenVMS users to log into remote systems and remote users to log
           into OpenVMS systems.

           Telnet provides support for both character and line modes. It also al-
           lows users to activate multiple Telnet sessions.

           Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS Version 4.1       SPD 46.46.05


           o  Telnet 3270

           Telnet 3270 enables users to make Telnet connections from OpenVMS sys-
           tems to remote IBM[R] systems using a 3270-style terminal interface.

           o  Berkeley Remote Commands (rlogin, rsh, rexec)

           Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS implements the popular UNIX re-
           mote login (rlogin), remote shell (rsh), and remote executive (rexec)
           services.

           As with Telnet, remote login (rlogin) enables users to log into re-
           mote systems and remote users to log into OpenVMS systems.

           OpenVMS users can use rsh to execute commands on remote systems and
           remote users to execute DCL commands on OpenVMS systems. Authentica-
           tion is based on either user password or proxy access.

           o  Remote Printing

           Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS provides the following remote print-
           ing services:

              -  OpenVMS users can issue DCL-style PRINT commands to print files
                 on remote systems using the LPD protocol.

              -  Remote users can print files on OpenVMS systems using the LPD
                 protocol.

              -  OpenVMS users can use the Telnet print symbiont to print files
                 on remote systems.

           o  Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)

           SMTP is the internet application protocol for mail. Users can send and
           receive electronic mail to and from remote hosts.

           NFS (Network File System)

           The NFS software supports the Network File System (NFS) Version 2.0
           protocol specifications. NFS is an application-layer protocol that pro-
           vides clients with transparent access to remote file services.

           The NFS server software promotes data sharing among clients by pro-
           viding a central data storage facility for OpenVMS and UNIX files. The
           NFS server software provides two types of file access for remote clients:

           o  Access to OpenVMS files

           o  Access to files that are compatible with the UNIX operating sys-
              tem

           Automount

           As implemented in Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS, the NFS com-
           mand AUTOMOUNT mounts and dismounts NFS file systems transparently on
           an as-needed basis, which is especially useful for mounting file sys-
           tems and directories that are only needed occasionally.

           File Conversion On-The-Fly

           The NFS protocol maximizes interoperability between OpenVMS and other
           systems by providing a sequential "read on-the-fly" file conversion
           capability.

           PC-NFS Server

           Remote PC users mount and access NFS files from OpenVMS. User/group
           identification (UID/GID) and authentication of the remote PC user are
           established through the use of the Digital TCP/IP Services for Open-
           VMS proxy database. Once access is established, users can print through
           the use of the PC-NFS printing mechanism.

           PATHWORKS Integration

           Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS supports the PATHWORKS IP driver
           for improved PATHWORKS and TCP/IP integration, which requires the PATH-
           WORKS Version 5 series.
