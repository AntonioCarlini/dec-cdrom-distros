 PRODUCT NAME:              ALL-IN-1 Web Interface V1.0 	
				


			
 
 DESCRIPTION

 The ALL-IN-1 Web Interface V1.0 (AWI) enables users of the 
Internet anywhere in the world to access documents in their  
ALL-IN-1 file cabinets. This opens up brand new possibilities 
for information distribution from ALL-IN-1, redefining existing  
ALL-IN-1 systems as Internet Service Providers. 

 The AWI media is installed on the customerís local Web server, 
on the internal side of the Internet ëfirewallí, communicating 
over IP with any ALL-IN-1 system. Any document placed in a 
WORLD READ Drawer or Drawer identified as accessible from 
the Internet (a new identifier in ALL-IN-1 V3.2) can then be 
accessed from Internet clients utilising software such as 
Netscape‘,  Mosaic‘   or LYNX.

 Documents and objects of any type may be placed in the    
ALL-IN-1 File Cabinet for immediate access from the Internet, 
thereby eliminating the need to produce documents in HTML 
(Hypertext Markup Language), saving on the cost of HTML 
authoring tools and the training of staff in their use.

 The AWI uses standard Web Server functionality such as the 
Common Gateway Interface (CGI), performing conversion to 
HTML ìon the flyî. The code, written in ëCí, is highly portable 
and will be available for an increasing number of Web Server 
platforms.

Operational Requirements

The AWI communicates:

o with ALL-IN-1 Alpha or VAX 3.2 systems (SPD:27.30)

o over TCP/IP networks based on TGV Multinet‚, Wollongong 
Pathway‚, Process  Software TCPware‚ or Digital TCP/IP 
Services 

   and requires Distributed Sharing Option (SPD: 36.97) to be 
licensed on at least one ALL-IN-1 system communicating with 
the local Internet server

programming, and user procedures is included with the 
individual kits and on-line.
