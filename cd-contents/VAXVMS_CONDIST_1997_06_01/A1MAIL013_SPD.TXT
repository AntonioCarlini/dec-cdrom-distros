 PRODUCT NAME:  MailWorks for OpenVMS, Version 1.3A     SPD 39.59.02

 DESCRIPTION

 This document describes the following components of the MailWorks prod-
 uct family: MailWorks Server for OpenVMS, MailWorks for OpenVMS Video
 Terminals and MailWorks for OpenVMS DECwindows. These components are
 layered software products that reside on OpenVMS.

 MailWorks is an electronic messaging application that implements the
 international messaging standards set by the CCITT X.400 P2 recommen-
 dations. It provides a means of exchanging messages and attached data
 with other users.

 Layered on top of Digital Equipment Corporation's VAX Message Router
 (SPD 26.33.xx), MailWorks interacts with all other MAILbus gateways
 and complementary products.

 The MailWorks Server for OpenVMS supports clients on DOS PC, Microsoft
 Windows environment and Apple Macintosh computers. The supported clients
 include MailWorks for DOS, the TeamLinks products for Microsoft Win-
 dows and Macintosh, cc:Mail Connection for Mailworks, and the Microsoft
 Mail Driver for MailWorks. The MailWorks Server for OpenVMS supports
 the MailWorks for OpenVMS Video Terminals and MailWorks for OpenVMS
 DECwindows components. The MailWorks for OpenVMS Video Terminals and
 MailWorks for OpenVMS DECwindows components reside with the MailWorks
 Server and are not clients.

 MailWorks for OpenVMS on VAX and AXP are identical in functionality,
 with the following restrictions:

 o  Clusters of mixed VAX and AXP are not supported.

 o  MailWorks for OpenVMS DECwindows is not supported on AXP.

                               DIGITAL                  January 1995

                                                         AE-PNDEC-TK

 

 o  ALL-IN-1 Mail for Macintosh and ALL-IN-1 Mail for Windows are not
    supported on AXP.

 o  The MailWorks WAN and LAN packages are available only on VAX.

 o  DX, WPL, DDIF, and DTIF converters are not included on AXP.

 MailWorks was formerly named ALL-IN-1 MAIL and DEC MAILworks.

 Client software performs services for users. This software resides on
 an intelligent desktop device and takes advantage of the processing
 power on the desk. The OpenVMS components (for Video Terminals or DECwindows
 devices) run on the OpenVMS VAX operating system and must reside within
 the same node or VAXcluster as the server.

 Clients are connected to the MailWorks Server, which performs local
 and wide area network delivery services.

 Transport between MailWorks Servers, and between MailWorks Servers and
 the ALL-IN-1 product family, is performed by the VAX Message Router.
 Optional gateways may also be connected to the VAX Message Router as
 needed for mail transfer in a multivendor environment.

 Users might alternately use an intelligent workstation in the office,
 a video terminal at home, or a laptop PC while traveling. Clients are
 provided for all three situations and for others, all using the same
 user mailbox and files on the server.

 MailWorks adheres to the National Institute for Science and Technol-
 ogy (NIST) profile of 1984 CCITT X.400 recommendations. It provides
 a level of messaging service compatible with that of the electronic
 messaging subsystem of the ALL-IN-1 integrated office system, and adds
 new service elements defined in X.400 and MailWorks.

 Features

 Transports

 The MailWorks Server for OpenVMS supports three different client-to-
 server transport connections. They are DECnet, TCP/IP, and asynchronous
 connections with Kermit or Zmodem.

 The MailWorks Server can support all of these transports simultane-
 ously. The client specifies which transport it will use to connect to
 the server. By default the server will support DECnet and asynchronous
 connections. To make a TCP/IP connection, the proper software must be
 running on the server along with the correct configuration modifica-
 tions to enable this transport.

 Even if DECnet is not being used to connect from the client to the Mail-
 Works Server, it is still required to run on the VAX with the Mail-
 Works Server for the various network connections made by the MailWorks
 Server.

 Compatibility with VMSmail

 Users can migrate easily from VMSmail to MailWorks. The interfaces are
 logical extensions of the VMSmail interface, and commands and services
 will be familiar. Addresses and distribution lists used in VMSmail can
 be used in MailWorks. From the OpenVMS components, nickname logicals
 may be used. Most addresses used in VMSmail distribution lists may be
 used in MailWorks with similar restrictions as found when using such
 a list from another node.

 No file cabinet conversion is required for the Video Terminal compo-
 nent. A one-time file cabinet conversion is required to make OpenVMS
 mail messages available from the PC.

 Messages can be exchanged with VMSmail on the same system or elsewhere
 in the network by means of the VAX Message Router VMSmail Gateway. This
 is included in the MailWorks Wide Area Network and Local Area Network
 Server Packages for VAX or can be purchased as an option.


                                  3

 

 Users can select an editor for use in MailWorks Video Terminal and DECWin-
 dows components. Any editor called or spawned under VMSmail can be called
 or spawned from MailWorks.

 Compatibility with ALL-IN-1

 Messages can be exchanged with the ALL-IN-1 integrated office system
 by means of the VAX Message Router using the same style of address-
 ing.

 The services of MailWorks are compatible with services in the elec-
 tronic messaging subsystem of ALL-IN-1. For example, read receipts from
 either product are honored by the other.

 Distribution lists created in the ALL-IN-1 integrated office system
 can be used in MailWorks. They work with the same restrictions found
 when sending a list to another ALL-IN-1 office system node. (Refer to
 product documentation for details.) Addressing strings used in the ALL-IN-1
 office system work equally well in MailWorks, with the exception of
 addressing strings that invoke ALL-IN-1 foreign protocol hook (those
 beginning with an underscore).

 X.400 Message Transport

 Messages can be exchanged with other MailWorks domains and services
 that meet international X.400 P2 conformance criteria.

 Within a customer network, messages are transported by means of VAX
 Message Router. Transport to another vendor's X.400 service requires
 an OSI networking stack and the VAX Message Router X.400 Gateway (MRX).

 OSI message exchange requires at least one MRX Gateway in each Dig-
 ital domain (usually one per customer network). Refer to the VAX Mes-
 sage Router X.400 Gateway Software Product Description (SPD 27.50.xx)
 for hardware/software requirements.

 Supporting the Multivendor Environment



                                  4

 

 MAILbus offers a series of off-the-shelf gateways and a gateway de-
 velopment kit to create other gateways for message exchange with other
 vendors' proprietary mail systems. Refer to the appropriate Software
 Product Description for the products' hardware/software requirements.

 Addressing Options

 MailWorks uses Digital's Enterprisewide Distributed Directory Service
 (DDS) as its user address directory. This distributed directory, avail-
 able as part of the VAX Message Router, links MailWorks, TeamLinks Mail,
 the ALL-IN-1 integrated office system, the gateways, and any other agents
 sharing its directory services.

 The DDS directory is a networking resource available only while the
 server connection is in place.

 In addition, the MailWorks OpenVMS components provide a Personal Ad-
 dress Book (PAB). The PAB allows users to store and retrieve commonly
 used mail addresses, along with name, phone number, and nickname.

 The MailWorks OpenVMS components also support creation and access of
 distribution lists, which provides an easy way to address large groups
 of users. These distribution lists can be shared among a group of users
 by using the OpenVMS Access Control facilities.

 During addressing, users can easily access DDS, the PAB, and distri-
 bution lists. All three services can be used in combination during mes-
 sage creation.

 Filing Services

 MailWorks provides a filing structure of drawers and folders as well
 as access to RMS files. Filing services are similar in nature to VMS-
 mail. A DECwindows device with local storage may have one or more draw-
 ers on the local device in addition to one or more drawers on the server.

 OpenVMS based drawers may be shared among groups of users, with each
 user's privileges defined by OpenVMS access controls.

 Message Retrieval

                                  5

 

 Messages can be retrieved based on user specification of certain header
 fields and filing structures.

 File Formats

 MailWorks is designed to handle various file formats with features that
 allow configuration for maximum readability of messages. The system
 allows for the automated handling of messages in different formats and
 for invocation of other file formatting or conversion routines.

 The MailWorks OpenVMS components can be set up to invoke viewers or
 applications based on the file type of each attachment.

 MailWorks can be set to perform automatic conversions of message com-
 ponents as they are delivered, using optional third-party converters
 such as KEYpak for OpenVMS (SPD 32.71.xx). This is an additional-cost
 option. Users can register their file format preferences in the pro-
 file.

 For advice on interchange of specific file formats, especially across
 gateways, consult your local Digital office.

 Help

 Users can get help for MailWorks using the Help facility. Help pro-
 vides basic information on how to perform the function in question with-
 out users having to reference the documentation.

 Printing

 MailWorks takes advantage of Digital's standard OpenVMS printing. Users
 can specify the printer destination and options.

 Messaging Functions

 Users can create, read, and send messages using the commands provided.
 Messages can contain information in a variety of file format types.

 Messages can be forwarded to another destination. Message attachments
 may include another message, a document or file, or even a binary file.

                                  6

 

 When replying to a message, the system automatically addresses the an-
 swer for transfer back to the original sender. Users can reply to the
 sender, all the original recipients, or to a reply-to list.

 Messages can be addressed to one or more users at any valid MAILbus
 destination (e.g., VMSmail, X.400, etc.) worldwide. File formats may
 possibly be modified by gateways or user agents to make the memo read-
 able to the recipient. Not all file formats are supported by all gate-
 ways and user agents. Care should be taken in planning the network ca-
 pabilities to ensure maximum readability of memos.

 Delivery Reports and Read Receipts

 Users can specify Delivery Reports and Read Receipts when sending a
 message. This causes a message to be generated and returned to the orig-
 inator when the message is delivered or read.

 New Mail Notification

 Users can choose to receive notification of the arrival of new mes-
 sages.

 Message Redirection

 Users can request that all incoming messages be automatically redi-
 rected to a secondary address.

 Priority-Based Delivery

 Users can choose priority for message delivery. The grade of deliv-
 ery (express, first class, second class) can be specified.

 Message Classes

 Users can set a number of indicators to give the recipient informa-
 tion about the nature of the message: Importance (high, medium, low),
 Sensitivity (not restricted, personal, private, company confidential).

 These fields may also be used to locate classes of messages in the file
 cabinet.

 System Management

                                  7

 

 Required local system management for the mail system is minimal and
 usually automated. A system manager or administrator is required to
 create a standard OpenVMS account; when the user first accesses MailWorks,
 basic account setup functions are performed automatically; most rou-
 tine functions can be performed by the users.

 There are no special utilities to run for file cabinet maintenance.
 All user areas on the server should be backed up or restored using stan-
 dard OpenVMS utilities.

 The mail management design adheres to the coordinated management sys-
 tem used by the MAILbus family of products. The MailWorks Server pro-
 vides a management utility that allows configuration changes to be made
 and the status of the mail system to be checked.

 Internationalization

 MailWorks Server for OpenVMS, MailWorks for OpenVMS Video Terminals,
 and MailWorks for OpenVMS DECwindows are designed to support multi-
 lingual operations. They can be deployed in a multilingual network and
 can support multilingual operations on a single server system. Mail-
 Works Server for OpenVMS, MailWorks for OpenVMS Video Terminals, and
 MailWorks for OpenVMS DECwindows support the Digital Multinational char-
 acter set.

 MailWorks Documentation

 MailWorks Server documentation consists of the MailWorks for OpenVMS
 Installation and the MailWorks for OpenVMS System Manager's Guide. The
 installation guide includes information on installing the DECwindows
 and Video Terminals components. The documentation also includes user
 guides for the DECWindows and Video Terminal components.








                                  8

 

 MailWorks for OpenVMS Video Terminals

 MailWorks for OpenVMS Video Terminals looks like VMSmail but commu-
 nicates directly with the MailWorks Server, and uses a rich protocol
 that accesses the full range of messaging services. This component is
 co-located with the MailWorks Server. It provides ordinary terminals
 with the same access to the services of MailWorks.

 MailWorks for OpenVMS DECwindows

 MailWorks for OpenVMS DECwindows is a DECwindows component of Mail-
 Works. MailWorks for OpenVMS DECwindows adheres to the DECwindows Style
 Guide and can be used either on a workstation that is co-located with
 the MailWorks server or remotely using an X11 display server device
 supported by Digital.

 Access from Other Platforms

 Because MailWorks conforms to the DECwindows standards, users of de-
 vices which have X-servers available can access the mail software. In
 this case, the message composition and storage activities are not han-
 dled on the desktop device but on the MailWorks platform. The windows
 display is handled by the desktop device. This feature provides ac-
 cess for additional desktop devices that conform to the DECwindows stan-
 dards.

 Processor Restrictions

 A TK50 Tape Drive is required for standalone MicroVAX 2000 and VAXs-
 tation 2000 systems.

 The component software must run within the same VAXcluster as the server
 software.

 When the product is used remotely by an X11 display device, the in-
 terface quality depends on the screen size, resolution and aspect of
 the X11 display server device.

 The sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
 system environment, configuration, and software options.

 The user space required on the server is determined by the amount of
 mail the user files.

 Memory Requirements for DECwindows Support

 The minimum supported memory for this application running in a stan-
 dalone DECwindows environment with both the client and server execut-
 ing on that same system is 8 MB.

 The performance and memory usage of DECwindows applications are par-
 ticularly sensitive to system configuration. Less memory may be re-
 quired on the client system (the system where the software is installed
 and executed) if the display server (the component that displays the
 application) resides on another system. More memory may be required
 on a system with several applications running, or where it may be de-
 sirable to improve the performance of an application.

 CLUSTER ENVIRONMENT

 The OpenVMS layered product components of this product are fully sup-
 ported when installed on any valid and licensed VAXcluster* config-
 uration without restrictions. The HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS sections of
 this Software Product Description detail any special hardware required
 by this product.

 *  V5.x VAXcluster configurations are fully described in the VAXclus-
    ter Software Product Description (SPD 29.78.xx) and include CI, Eth-
    ernet, and Mixed Interconnect configurations.

 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

 REQUIRED SOFTWARE

 For the MailWorks Server for OpenVMS to support any or all of the clients,
 and for MailWorks for OpenVMS Video Terminals:

 OpenVMS VAX:

 o  OpenVMS VAX Operating System V5.5-2 or higher

 o  DECnet

    *  DECnet for OpenVMS VAX V5.5 or higher, or

    *  DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS VAX V5.6B ECO 10 or higher (Note: long
       node names are not supported)

 OpenVMS AXP:

 o  OpenVMS AXP Operating System, V6.1

 o  DECnet

    *  DECnet for OpenVMS AXP V6.1, or

    *  DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS AXP V5.8 (Note: long node names are not
       supported)

 The MailWorks Server delivers messages among all the users of any com-
 bination of the available clients or components that use this one server.
 Thus, all users on a single VAXcluster or on a single LAN may exchange
 messages via a single MailWorks Server.

 The VAX Message Router Transfer Service is required to exchange mes-
 sages with users on other servers or other electronic messaging prod-
 ucts. On OpenVMS VAX, it may co-reside with the MailWorks Server or
 may reside on another DECnet node. On OpenVMS AXP, it must reside on
 another VAX node. To communicate with VMSmail users, the VMSmail Gate-
 way is also required.

                                 18

 

 Most configurations will require VAX Message Router, and all sites mi-
 grating from or interacting with a VMSmail product will require the
 VMSmail Gateway. The MailWorks Wide Area Network and Local Area Net-
 work Server Packages combine these underlying software components with
 the MailWorks Server on VAX.

 For the MailWorks for OpenVMS DECwindows on the Workstation (not avail-
 able on OpenVMS AXP)

 o  OpenVMS VAX Operating System V5.5-2 or higher (and necessary com-
    ponents of OpenVMS DECwindows)

 o  DECnet

    *  DECnet for OpenVMS VAX V5.5 or higher, or

    *  DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS VAX V5.6B ECO 10 or higher (Note: long
       node names are not supported).

 This product can run in any of the following ways:

 o  On a workstation that is a member of the same Local Area VAXclus-
    ter as the mail server software

 o  On a separate workstation device that is not a member of the VAX-
    cluster where the component and mail server software are running,
    but is connected to VAXcluster via DECnet

 o  On the server CPU or VAXcluster using an attached X11 display de-
    vice supported by Digital

 OpenVMS DECwindows is part of the OpenVMS Operating System but must
 be installed separately. Installation of OpenVMS DECwindows gives the
 user the option to install any or all of the following three compo-
 nents:

 o  OpenVMS DECwindows Compute Server (Base kit; includes runtime sup-
    port)

 o  OpenVMS DECwindows Device Support

 o  OpenVMS DECwindows Programming Support

                                 19

 

 For standalone execution, the following DECwindows components must be
 installed on the workstation machine:

 o  OpenVMS DECwindows Compute Server

 o  OpenVMS DECwindows Device Support

 For remote execution, the following DECwindows components must be in-
 stalled on the machines:

 On the X11 Display Device:

 o  OpenVMS DECwindows Compute Server

 o  OpenVMS DECwindows Device Support
