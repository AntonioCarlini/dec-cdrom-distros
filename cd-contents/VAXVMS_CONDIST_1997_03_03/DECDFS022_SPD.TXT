PRODUCT NAME:  DECdfs for OpenVMS                      SPD 28.78.06
               Version 2.2

DESCRIPTION

DECdfs for OpenVMS is a DECnet and DECnet/OSI layered product that pro-
vides OpenVMS users with the ability to use remote OpenVMS VAX and Open-
VMS Alpha disks as if they were directly attached to the local Open-
VMS system.

DECdfs software provides users and applications with transparent, high
performance file access while using fewer CPU resources than standard
DECnet and DECnet/OSI file access.

Systems running DECdfs software can act as "servers" or "clients" or
both. DECdfs servers make file resources available to systems running
DECdfs client software. DECdfs clients are able to use file resources
of systems running DECdfs server software. The file resources acces-
sible through DECdfs can range in scope from a master file directory
and all of its subordinate directories and files on a disk volume, to
an individual file. The DECdfs server software assigns a unique name
to the resource to be shared.

In configurations where DECdns (Distributed Name Service) is supported,
the DECdfs server registers the resource name with DECdns. In config-
urations where DECdns is not supported, the DECdfs client must include
the resource location name when issuing the command to use the resource.

DECdfs software uses DECdns on OpenVMS VAX configurations running DEC-
net or DECnet/OSI, and on OpenVMS Alpha configurations running DEC-
net/OSI. In order for DECdfs to use DECdns, there must be at least one
DECdns server in the network. DECdns allows the name of the resource

to be independent of its physical location on the network. DECdfs sys-
tems throughout the network can continue accessing a resource even if
the resource location is changed.

DECdns is not available on OpenVMS Alpha configurations running DEC-
net, but these configurations can use DECdfs by specifying the node
name where the resource is located.

The DECdfs client uses the resource by means of the DFS$CONTROL MOUNT
command. This command specifies the DECdns name by which the resource
was registered, enables communication between the client and the server,
and creates a pseudo-device on the client system. The pseudo-device
makes the remote resource appear to the client system as a local disk.
Users can then perform operations on the pseudo-device, and DECdfs han-
dles all of the network access and translation.

Features

The features of DECdfs for OpenVMS Version 2.2 include:

o  High performance access to remote disks

o  Applications require no modifications to use remote disks, because
   the disks appear to be local

o  Fewer CPU resources used than standard DECnet and DECnet/OSI file
   access

o  Supports all OpenVMS file types

o  Supports the following OpenVMS file operations:

   -  Shared access (read)

   -  Exclusive access (read & write)

   -  All OpenVMS directory operations, including the creation and dele-
      tion of directories

   -  Virtual I/O

   -  Mapped I/O

                                 2

 

o  Transparent access to most of the standard OpenVMS DCL commands (those
   commands which neither manipulate identifiers nor use logical, phys-
   ical or write-shared I/O)

o  Operates in any DECnet or DECnet/OSI environment; both Local Area
   Networks and Wide Area Networks are supported

o  Uses DECdns, if present, to provide location-independent data ac-
   cess

o  File security provided through standard OpenVMS proxy mechanisms.
   The system manager on the server controls all file access

o  Optional end-to-end checksum provided to guard against network faults

o  The DECdfs Management utility allows the user to control DECdfs com-
   ponents and to display statistical and error information

o  Supports 64-bit addresses for I/O buffers on OpenVMS Alpha Version 7.0

Restrictions

o  Files opened for write are opened exclusively

o  Logical I/O is not supported

o  Installed files are not supported

o  The use of ACLs (Access Control Lists) on DECdfs client devices is
   not supported. ACLs on served files are not visible to a DECdfs client.

DISK SPACE REQUIREMENTS

To install DECdfs for OpenVMS Version 2.2, you need the following free
space on your system disk:

o  3200 free blocks for an OpenVMS Alpha system

o  1300 free blocks for an OpenVMS VAX system

This size is approximate; the actual size may vary depending on your
system environment, configuration, and software options.

GROWTH CONSIDERATIONS

The minimum hardware and software requirements for any future version
of this product may be different from the requirements for the cur-
rent version.

ORDERING INFORMATION

The software media and documentation are available in two media for-
mats:

o  TK50 streaming tape: QA-VEQAA-H5

o  CD-ROM: QA-VEQAA-H8

DECdfs for OpenVMS Version 2.2 software and documentation are also in-
cluded in the OpenVMS Software Product Library and the OpenVMS Online
Documentation Library respectively.

SOFTWARE LICENSING

A license is required for each OpenVMS system on which the DECdfs for
OpenVMS software is to be installed and executed. A DECdfs license is
required on:

o  Each server node that registers available directories or files for
   access and use by DECdfs clients

                                 5

 

o  Each client node that accesses and uses the directories or files
   on a DECdfs server

Each OpenVMS system may be licensed to use the full functionality of
DECdfs or the client functionality only. A full functionality license
grants the right to use both the client capabilities and the server
capabilities.

The following table lists the appropriate licenses.
