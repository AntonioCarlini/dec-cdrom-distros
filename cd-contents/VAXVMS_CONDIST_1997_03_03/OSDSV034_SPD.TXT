   Digital Optical Storage Desktop Software (OSDS) for OpenVMS VAX and
   Alpha, Version 3.4

        1 DESCRIPTION

              The Digital[TM] Optical Storage Desktop Software (Digital
              OSDS) for OpenVMS[TM] product provides OpenVMS applications
              and users the functionality necessary to access a
              standalone, multifunction optical drive or drives using
              the conventional device, file, and record access services
              provided by the OpenVMS Operating System. In most cases, no
              changes will be required to existing applications that use
              magnetic disk storage.

              The OpenVMS VAX[TM] and OpenVMS Alpha versions of Digital
              OSDS provide local or VMScluster[TM] access to rewritable
              or WORM (Write Once, Read Many) media containing FILES-11
              on-disk structure using the RWZ5x series of optical drives.
              Digital OSDS for OpenVMS VAX also provides support for
              WORM media containing the WORMS-11[R] on-disk structure
              using the RWZ5x optical drives. Digital OSDS for OpenVMS
              Alpha does not support any configuration using WORM media
              containing the WORMS-11 on-disk structure.

              Pseudo-Device Representation

              Digital OSDS allows the OpenVMS host to view the media
              inserted into the optical disk as a virtual disk device.
              For single-headed drives, this translates to one virtual
              disk device for each optical disk surface. The optical
              drive, therefore, appears to applications as a virtual disk
              device, or pseudo-device. Excluding those functions that
              are unique to the optical technology, the pseudo-device
              emulates the operation of a conventional OpenVMS magnetic
              disk.

              Volume Access

              Volumes in an optical drive used with Digital OSDS are
              accessed using the same techniques that are used to access
              conventional OpenVMS disks. The standard OpenVMS INITIALIZE
              command is used to prepare each side of an optical disk
              media for use and the standard OpenVMS MOUNT command is

                                                                        1

 







              used to make the volume known to OpenVMS. WORM volumes can
              be "initialized" only once, whereas rewritable volumes,
              like magnetic disks, can be "initialized" many times.

              File Access

              Files on volumes under control of Digital OSDS are
              accessed using the same techniques that are used to access
              conventional OpenVMS files. Once a volume has been mounted,
              files can be opened, read, written, and closed using the
              conventional OpenVMS system services and run-time library
              functions. WORM volumes can use the FILES-11 or WORMS-11
              file system. Rewritable volumes use the FILES-11 file
              system.

              Digital OSDS provides essentially transparent access
              using standard OpenVMS commands and I/O statements from
              application programs. Digital OSDS supports all OpenVMS
              commands and their library routine equivalents, such as,
              but not limited to:

              ALLOCATE         DEALLOCATE    MOUNT
              APPEND           DELETE[2]     OPEN
              BACKUP[1]        DIFFERENCE    PURGE
              CLOSE            DIRECTORY     READ
              COPY             DISMOUNT      RENAME
              CREATE           EDIT          WRITE
              CREATE           INITIALIZE[3]
              /DIRECTORY
    
              [1] Not all backup options are supported using WORM media.

              [2] This command can be used with WORM media but will not
                  free up additional disk space as with rewritable media.
    
              [3] This command can be used only once with WORM media.

        2 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

              The person planning a system configuration must understand
              the hardware requirements of the complete system. Due to
              the variety of processors that support OpenVMS and the
              length of time that some OpenVMS systems have been in
              service, there exist a huge combination of processor, SCSI
              adapter/controller, and optical subsystem combinations.
              Some combinations are not supported.

              Disk Space Requirements

              ___________________________________________________________
                            Blocks[1]  Mbytes

              VAX           15,000     7.7
              installation
              VAX use        4,000     2
              Alpha         15,000     7.7

              Alpha use      3,500     1.75
    
              [1] 1 block = 512 bytes


              These counts refer to the disk space required on the system
              disk. Additional disk space might be required based on the
              user's system environment and configuration, as well as the
              user options selected at installation time.

              The minimum memory supported is 16 Mbytes for VAX systems
              and 32 Mbytes for Alpha systems. The use of this software
              in conjunction with increased memory capability improves
              performance. The memory size suggested for most typical VAX
              hardware configurations is at least 32 Mbytes.
