           PRODUCT NAME:  Archive/Backup System                   SPD 48.16.06
                          Version 2.1 for OpenVMS

           DESCRIPTION

           Archive/Backup System (ABS) Version 2.1 for OpenVMS introduces a new
           name for Digital's newest OpenVMS archive and backup product. ABS is
           the new name for the product formerly known as POLYCENTER Archive/Backup
           (PAB) for OpenVMS. For license options, see the section titled LICENSE
           OPTIONS in this document.

           ABS Version 2.1 allows you to choose the mode of operation that you
           prefer. The Archive/Backup System for OpenVMS Management Tools (ABS
           OMT) mode provides a streamlined backup capability and a new, easy-
           to-use graphical user interface (GUI). The ABS OMT mode is the same
           as that offered in the Enterprise Integration Package defined for Wave
           3 of the NT Affinity Program. The ABS full mode provides more options
           for more experienced, advanced users. Both modes support NT and UNIX
           clients.

           ABS automates backup operations, provides for system archiving, and
           makes it easy to find files stored on tapes and disks. ABS also pro-
           vides client backup facilities, and therefore is a major component in
           a "lights out" data center environment. ABS Version 2.1 expands these
           backup facilities to include support of NT clients, in addition to the
           selected UNIX clients introduced in ABS Version 2.0.

           Features

           ABS provides the following important file archiving and backup capa-
           bilities:

           o  New Motif based GUI under the ABS OMT mode

                                                                 February 1997

                                                                   AE-QHD6G-TE

 



           Archive/Backup System                                 SPD 48.16.06
           Version 2.1 for OpenVMS

           o  Full mode GUI for defining archive and backup policies, saving and
              restore data, and for finding data objects and databases that have
              been backed up or archived using ABS.

           o  Automatic, flexible scheduling of backup and archive operations for
              OpenVMS systems and for selected NT and UNIX clients.

           o  Support for OpenVMS client backup and archiving operations directly
              between disks and tape drives located on different systems using
              DECnet[TM] or DECnet-Plus[TM] network protocol. ABS uses TCP/IP pro-
              tocol for supported NT and UNIX Clients, without staging data on
              disks.

           o  Online maintenance of information about backed up and archived files,
              disk volumes and databases. This allows for quickly retrieving files
              or restoring disk volumes without the having to know the names of
              the tape volumes on which the data was saved.

           o  Integration with POLYCENTER Scheduler for advanced and complex schedul-
              ing of backup and archive operations.

           o  Easily installed and configured, with an out-of-the-box default con-
              figuration.

           o  Error recovery and reporting capability

           o  Integration with RMU/BACKUP and RMU/RESTORE, allowing backup and
              restore operations of Oracle Rdb[TM] databases

           o  Layers upon a robust and fully tested media manager that provides
              the following important media and device management capabilities:

              -  Effective use of all media capacity by appending multiple save
                 sets of backed up or archived files to the same volume or vol-
                 ume set

              -  Direct positioning to the start of each save set file during a
                 restore operation using saved information about the tape posi-
                 tion of each save set file

              -  Customization features to meet a variety of operational and site
                 requirements

           Version 2.1 for OpenVMS

              -  Support for unattended backup operations using automatic tape
                 cartridge loaders; optional support for the StorageTek[R] au-
                 tomated cartridge server

              -  Media life cycle control including maintenance of volume reten-
                 tion period, availability status, location, and scheduling dates
                 when volumes are to move offsite and return.

              -  Maintenance of counters for each volume noting the number of times
                 a volume has been mounted and the number of errors associated
                 with the volume. These counters are used to schedule volume clean-
                 ing when the counters exceed setable threshold values.

              -  Media allocation control based on customer-defined media pools.

              -  Ability to print external tape labels in a customizable format.

              -  Built-in report generation and custom report generation capa-
                 bility.

              -  Security features to prevent unauthorized media or device use.

              -  Round-robin device allocation to distribute drive usage among
                 available tape drives.

              -  In an OpenVMS[TM] Cluster environment, automatic failure recov-
                 ery from the loss of a processor to allow continuous access to
                 the media databases.

           o  Integration with the Remote Device Facility (RDF[TM]).

              The RDF software is included within the media management software.
              RDF allows the media manager to access a tape from other OpenVMS
              nodes across the DECnet or DECnet-Plus network for ABS backup and
              archive operations.

              RDF makes access to remote tape drives invisible to ABS backup and
              archive operations by issuing commands as appropriate when a des-
              ignated tape drive is considered remote. The media manager also man-
              ages volume load requests to remote systems to allow unattended back-

                                            3

              ups or to communicate with a console operator. The media manager
              makes no direct use of the remote disk capabilities within RDF.

              RDF includes the following components:

              -  RDF servers that execute tape I/O requests on behalf of a re-
                 mote client. Servers are located on systems that have tape drives
                 attached or that can access drives through the OpenVMS TMSCP[TM]
                 server.

              -  RDF clients that provide the communications interface between
                 applications reading or writing data to a tape drive and the RDF
                 servers.

           Disk Space Required for Media Database and Catalogs

           The media manager database should be placed only on nodes executing
           ABS for OpenVMS Server software.

           The disk space required by the ABS for OpenVMS media database depends
           on the number of pieces of media to be managed. During installation,
           the storage administrator may designate the disk on which the media
           manager database is to be kept. For enhanced data safety, the media
           manager database may be stored on a shadowed disk.

           ABS catalog files are present on any node executing either ABS server
           software or ABS client software. The disk space required by ABS cat-
           alogs depends on the number of files to be tracked by the ABS soft-
           ware.

           Disk Space Required for the ABS Server Software

           Executing the ABS server software requires approximately 50,000 blocks,
           plus one block for every piece of media it manages. Each instance of
           saving a file requires less space in the catalog. For example, the first
           five times a file is saved, it requires approximately .73 blocks per
           file. If the file is save 20 times, it requires approximately .45 blocks
           per file.

           Disk Space Required for the ABS Client and ABS ACS Software

           Version 2.1 for OpenVMS

           Execution of ABS client software requires approximately 20,000 blocks.
           Each instance of saving a file requires less space in the catalog. For
           example, the first five times a file is saved, it requires approxi-
           mately .73 blocks per file. If the file is save 20 times, it requires
           approximately .45 blocks per file.

           All of the disk space requirements previously specified are in ref-
           erence to the system disk. The sizes are approximate; actual sizes may
           vary depending on the user's system environment, configuration, and
           software options.

           Disk Space Required for the ABS NT or UNIX Client Software

           ABS NT and UNIX Client software is included in the ABS Server for Open-
           VMS software. Only the proper UNIX or NT Client License Packs are needed
           to enable the software.

           DEVICE SUPPORT TABLES

           ABS Version 2.1 for OpenVMS supports a large array of storage devices,
           ranging from single-tape drives to automated optical and tape juke-
           boxes. This support is provided by the media management software.

           The tables identify devices by Digital-known identifiers. If you use
           third-party products that contain Digital drives, those drives are shown
           in the tables under the Digital name.

           The supported devices are listed in Tables 1 and 2. Table 3 provides
           descriptions and restrictions for this information.
