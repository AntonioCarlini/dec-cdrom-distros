                          Version 2.8A for OpenVMS

           DESCRIPTION

           Data center managers face major storage management problems: system
           backup and restore complexity and effective file archiving and retrieval.
           The Storage Library System (SLS) for OpenVMS provides the solution for
           OpenVMS environments.

           SLS for OpenVMS includes a remote backup facility and is a major com-
           ponent in "lights out" data center operations.

           Features

           o  Automatic, flexible scheduling of backup operations

           o  Centralized services for user-requested backup and archiving op-
              erations

           o  Support for remote backup and archiving operations directly between
              disks and tape drives located on different systems within a DEC-
              net network without staging data across disks

           o  Online maintenance of information about backed up and archived files
              and volumes; this allows quick retrieval of the files or restora-
              tion of disk volumes without the user having to know the names of
              the tape volumes on which the data was saved

           o  Support for OpenVMS systems in both mixed-interconnect and mixed
              architecture OpenVMS Clusters

           o  Integration with RMU/BACKUP and RMU/RESTORE, allowing backup and
              restore of Oracle Rdb[TM] databases using SLS managed media

                                                                 February 1997

                                                                   AE-LB73R-TE

 



           Storage Library System                                SPD 29.67.15
           Version 2.8A for OpenVMS

           o  Effective use of all media capacity by appending multiple sets of
              backed up or archived files to the same volume or volume set

           o  Direct positioning to the start of each save set file during a re-
              store operation using saved information about the tape position of
              each save set file

           o  DCL and menu interfaces with online help for users, operators, and
              storage administrators

           o  Customization features to meet a variety of operational and site
              requirements

           SLS for OpenVMS provides the following important media and device man-
           agement capabilities:

           o  Support for unattended backup operations using a variety of auto-
              mated loaders including the StorageTek[R] automated cartridge server
              (Wolfcreek silo). For a complete list of supporte devices, see the
              addendum titled Section 13.

           o  Media life cycle control including maintenance of volume retention
              period, availability status, location, and scheduling of dates when
              volumes are to move offsite and return

           o  Maintenance of counters for each volume noting the number of times
              a volume has been mounted and the number of errors associated with
              the volume; these counters are used to schedule volume cleaning when
              the counters exceed threshold values

           o  Control of media allocation based on customer-defined media pools

           o  Ability to print external tape labels in a customizable format

           o  Built-in report generation and custom report generation capabil-
              ity

           o  Security features to prevent unauthorized media or device use

           o  "Round robin" device allocation to distribute drive usage among avail-
              able tape drives

           Version 2.8A for OpenVMS

           o  In an OpenVMS Cluster environment, automatic failure recovery from
              the loss of a processor to allow continuous access to the SLS for
              OpenVMS media databases

           Remote Device Facility (RDF[TM])

           The Remote Device Facility (RDF) software is included within the SLS
           for OpenVMS software. It is optionally installed during the SLS soft-
           ware installation procedure. No additional license is needed for RDF
           when used within the bounds of SLS.

           RDF allows SLS to access a tape or RV60-type optical disks from other
           OpenVMS nodes across the DECnet network for backup and archive oper-
           ations. RDF includes of the following components:

           o  RDF servers that execute tape I/O requests on behalf of a remote
              client. Servers are located on systems that have tape drives at-
              tached or on systems that can access drives through the OpenVMS TM-
              SCP Server.

           o  RDF clients that provide the communications interface between ap-
              plications reading or writing data to a tape drive and to the RDF
              servers.

           SLS for OpenVMS software makes access to remote tape drives transpar-
           ent to SLS backup and archive operations by issuing RDF commands as
           appropriate if a designated tape drive is a remote one. SLS for Open-
           VMS software also manages volume load requests to remote systems to
           allow unattended backups or to communicate with a console operator.
           SLS for OpenVMS makes no direct use of the remote disk capabilities
           inherent in RDF.

           LICENSE OPTIONS

           To support a variety of configuration requirements, the following SLS
           for OpenVMS license options are available:

           o  SLS for OpenVMS VAX

           o  SLS for OpenVMS Alpha

           o  SLS ACS for OpenVMS VAX

           o  SLS ACS for OpenVMS Alpha

           SLS for OpenVMS VAX and SLS for OpenVMS Alpha

           SLS for OpenVMS software provides full functionality, as described above,
           to users on the node or OpenVMS Cluster on which SLS is executing. A
           node or OpenVMS Cluster executing SLS for OpenVMS software provides
           media management services for itself and for any "client nodes" con-
           nected to it. At least one SLS for OpenVMS license in the network is
           required for use of the SLS for OpenVMS product.

           SLS for OpenVMS VAX and Alpha Clients

           SLS for OpenVMS Client software provides backup scheduling and archiv-
           ing services for the node or OpenVMS Cluster on which it is execut-
           ing, and acts as a client of another node executing SLS for OpenVMS
           software when it requires media management services.

           Like the SLS Sever software, the SLS Client software maintains SLS his-
           tory files where it records information about user files backed up or
           archived locally under its control. The node executing SLS for Open-
           VMS client software communicates using DECnet Phase IV or DECnet-Plus
           software to a node running the SLS for OpenVMS server software. The
           SLS server node maintains the SLS media database. The SLS media database
           contains information about volume location and pool access authoriza-
           tion.

           Each SLS for OpenVMS client node must be connected to a node or Open-
           VMS Cluster system executing the SLS for OpenVMS server software. Any
           number of SLS for OpenVMS client nodes may be connected to a single
           SLS for OpenVMS server node.

           Disk space required by the SLS for OpenVMS media database and history
           files:

           The SLS media database is present only on nodes executing SLS for Open-
           VMS server software (not on nodes executing SLS for OpenVMS client soft-
           ware). The disk space required by the SLS media database depends on
           the number of pieces of media to be managed. During installation, you
           may designate the disk on which the SLS media database will be kept.
           For enhanced data safety, the SLS media database may be stored on a
           shadowed disk.

           SLS history files are present on any node executing either SLS for Open-
           VMS server software or SLS for OpenVMS client software. The disk space
           required for a SLS history file depends upon the number of files to
           be tracked by SLS for OpenVMS software. During installation, you may
           designate the disk on which SLS history files are will be kept. For
           enhanced data safety, the SLS history files may be stored on a shad-
           owed disk.

           Total Disk Space Requirement for SLS for OpenVMS Server Software:

           Execution of SLS for OpenVMS Server software requires approximately
           8,400 blocks (the number of blocks occupied by SLS for OpenVMS and RDF
           software) plus one block for every piece of media it manages plus one
           block for every six files it tracks.

           Example: Assume that there are 1,500 pieces of media under management
           by SLS for OpenVMS software and that 60,000 files are tracked. The space
           required is:

           DEVICE SUPPORT TABLES

           SLS supports a large array of storage devices, ranging from single-
           tape drives to automated optical and tape jukeboxes, listed in Tables
           1 and 2. Table 3 provides important information about those devices,
           including firmware revision levels and other restrictions.

           The tables identify devices by Digital-known identifiers. If you use
           third-party products that contain Digital drives, those drives are shown
           in the tables under the Digital name.

           If you have devices not shown on the list, SLS may still support them.
           Digital continually tests its software on additional devices that may
           not have been added to this list. If you have a question about a par-
           ticular device, contact Digital customer support.
