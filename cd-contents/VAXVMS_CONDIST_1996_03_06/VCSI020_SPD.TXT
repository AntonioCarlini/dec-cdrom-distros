PRODUCT NAME:  DEC VOICE:mail for OpenVMS VAX,         SPD 38.62.02
               Version 2.0

DESCRIPTION

DEC VOICE:mail is a full functional voice messaging system that pro-
vides powerful features for sending, receiving, saving and managing
voice information over the phone. Voice information management fea-
tures include user defined folders for message management, selective
review of messages, and user controlled filters to control paging and
message notification. DEC VOICE:mail is an OpenVMS layered applica-
tion.

DEC VOICE:mail includes a message management environment for storage,
processing and management of the user's voice messages and stored voice
phrases.

DEC VOICE:mail connects to the telephone system via Digital's DECvoice
T1 hardware and software for audio messaging. DEC VOICE:mail also links
to the telephone system providing incoming call ID which can be used
for direct connection to personal greetings. Message waiting indica-
tion is also provided.

DEC VOICE:mail software provides users with personal voice Mailboxes
for these and other important communication functions:

o  24-hour telephone answering in the user's voice, providing a va-
   riety of personal greetings.

o  Easy transmission of messages and other voice information between
   users, including the creation of Distribution Lists for group mes-
   sages.

                                                      November 1995

                                                        AE-PZQLC-TE

 

o  World-wide access to messages from any DTMF (Dual Tone Multi Fre-
   quency) telephone, including office, home, hotel, car or airplane.

o  User-defined folders that allow the categorizing and saving of mes-
   sages for future use and reference.

o  A selective review feature that lets users choose the type of mes-
   sages they want to hear, such as messages from a specific caller,
   or messages saved in a particular Folder.

o  Message notification to any other telephone, including cellular phones
   and pagers. DEC VOICE:mail has the ability to call the user at any
   designated telephone number or pager for notification that a new
   message has been received.

o  Message editing, which allows the user to review and modify a mes-
   sage before sending it out. The user can add on to the message or
   erase and re-record the message.

o  Call management, which allows the user to control DEC VOICE:mail
   call transfers. The call management features includes: Call screen-
   ing, Call blocking and Forwarding of calls to another number.

The message management environment in DEC VOICE:mail allows for ef-
fective storage and distribution of voice messages. Messages are stored
with envelopes which contain message addressing information that points
to a single stored message segment. Messages sent to several Mailboxes
are recorded and stored only once, conserving disk space. DEC VOICE:mail
includes Phrase Library storage management of pre-recorded phrases,
and a phrase recording system which allows for creation of recorded
phrases using a telephone.

DEC VOICE:mail includes phone book services, which allow dial-by-name
requests using DEC VOICE:mail's directory.

DEC VOICE:mail Mailboxes can be controlled, managed and customized in
their access to the capabilities of the messaging system. Each Mail-
box is assigned a Class Of Service (COS) which control access to func-
tions like:

o  Maximum Message Length, Retention Time, Number of messages

                                 2

 

o  Allow/Disallow Message Editing

o  Message forwarding to Local extensions, Toll Calls or Long Distance

o  Allow/Disallow Message Notification to a Pager

o  Transfer to Extension or Operator

o  Access to Distribution Lists

o  Number of Greetings Allowed

o  Allow/Disallow Tagging messages Urgent, Private

o  Delivery/Receipt notification provides confirmation of messages reach-
   ing the recipient

DEC VOICE:mail includes System Management and Administration Utili-
ties for effective management of the messaging system. The utilities
are provided with both menu driven and command line interfaces. These
Utilities include:

o  Mailbox Utility to create, modify and delete individual or groups
   of Mailboxes.

o  Class Of Service Utility to modify any or all categories within a
   Class Of Service.

o  Mailbox and Line Usage Statistics DEC VOICE:mail provides statis-
   tics collection and management reporting on individual or groups
   of Mailboxes. Telephone line statistics can be collected and re-
   ported to analyze telephone port usage. Statistics data can be fed
   to external applications, e.g. billing applications.

o  Diagnostic Utilities for real-time monitoring of telephone ports
   and the information transfer between the PBX and DEC VOICE:mail.

DEC VOICE:mail allows for information transfer between DEC VOICE:mail
and most popular PBX models. This integration communicates the fol-
lowing information to and from the PBX:

o  The PBX identifies the called party so that DEC VOICE:mail can au-
   tomatically access the correct Mailbox after a busy signal or ring
   /no answer.

                                 3

 

o  When a new message has been delivered to a Mailbox, DEC VOICE:mail
   signals the PBX to activate Message Waiting Indication (MWI), ei-
   ther a light on the telephone or a special "stutter" dial tone.

o  A mailbox owner can be presented with a password prompt immediately
   if calling party information is availble

Up to 31 PBXs can be supported from one DEC VOICE:mail system.

DEC VOICE:mail supports the following telephone integration methods:

o  SMDI (Simplified Message Desk Interface) The SMDI protocol uses a
   RS232 data link for communication.

o  In-Band DTMF (Dual Tone Multi Frequency) In-Band DTMF uses DTMF tones
   on the talk-path for communication between the PBX and DEC VOICE:mail.
   In-Band DTMF integration can be received by DEC VOICE:mail imme-
   diately after the phone call has been established, or through E&M
   signalling protocol before establishing the phone call.

For certain PBXs that do not support SMDI or In-Band DTMF, signaling
integration can be achieved via a SID (Software Integration Device).
A SID is a protocol converter connected to the PBX on a separate sta-
tion line not connected to DEC VOICE:mail's talk path. The SID is con-
nected to the DEC VOICE:mail system via a RS232 data link, analogous
to the SMDI signaling method.

Other Hardware Required:

DECvoice T1 Hardware options:

The DTCN5 option is used to connect the DECvoice system to a maximum
of three digital DS1 telephone circuits. It consists of a quad Q-bus
module and a bulkhead adapter assembly used for telephone network con-
nection and a voice interconnect bus connection.

The DTC05 option is a quad sized Q-bus module that provides voice record-
ing, reproduction and DTMF recognition. One module required per eight
ports.

Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1):

Disk space required for      85,000 blocks
installation:
                             (42 Mbytes)


                                 7

 


Disk space required for      55,000 blocks
use (permanent):
                             (27 Mbytes)

These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
system environment, configuration, and software options.

The main purpose of DEC VOICE:mail is to store and manage Voice Mes-
sages. Storage of Voice Messages requires significant disk space. As
general guideline in planning disk space requirements the following
information can be used:

   1 Minute of Voice storage requires 240 kbytes of disk space when
   the default recording algorithm (32 Kbps ADPCM) is used.

Memory Requirements:

The minimum memory size required for most typical hardware configu-
rations is at least 24 Mbyte plus 1 Mbyte per telephone port connected
to the system.

Processor Restrictions:

DECvoice T1 hardware modules are not distributed, nor shareable, across
nodes in the VAXcluster. The DECvoice T1 modules must reside locally,
that is, on the processor where DEC VOICE:mail is installed. For more
information on DECvoice, refer to the DECvoice Software Product De-
scription (SPD 29.97.xx).

DEC VOICE:mail supports DECnet networking to exchange messages between
mailboxes. The networking functionality requires purchase of a FTSV
3.0 (SPD 39.84.xx) license. Networking allows nodes that are not on
the same cluster to deliver messages to each other.





                                 8

 

DEC VOICE:mail can be used on a VAXcluster. Messages for all mailboxes
are available from any node in the Cluster which runs DEC VOICE:mail
V2.0 and has DECvoice hardware modules. Up to 400 DECvoice ports can
be supported across an eight (8) node cluster. To ensure a Digital sup-
portable configuration, Digital recommends that installation include
Digital Installation Services. These services provide for configura-
tion, installation and telephone connection of the product by an ex-
perienced Digital Specialist.

Based on typical application performance, the following table lists
the maximum supported number of physical telephone lines for each sys-
tem processor type. This is based on 90% concurrent line utilization.

OPTIONAL HARDWARE

DEC VOICE:mail initiates call transfers using switch/hook signaling.
This requires that the DEC VOICE:mail system is connected via DECvoice
T1 to a T1 trunk circuit with FXO/FXS channels. This often requires
a Channel Bank to be connected between the telephone switch and the
DEC VOICE:mail system.

If PBX signaling integration is required via the SMDI or SID methods
one or more RS232 ports are required on the processor where DEC VOICE:mail
is installed.

DEC VOICE:mail is supported for SID integration using the VoiceBridge
Series II PBX Integration Unit.
