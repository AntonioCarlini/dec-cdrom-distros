 PRODUCT NAME:  VAXELN KAV Toolkit Extensions           SPD 34.18.01
                for VMS, Version 1.1

 DESCRIPTION

 The VAXELN KAV Toolkit Extensions for VMS is a VMS layered product that
 can be used in conjunction with the VAXELN Toolkit to develop dedi-
 cated realtime systems to run on the KAV30 module.

 The KAV30 is a VMEbus-based, VAX realtime single-board computer that
 runs a user's VAXELN system. It is based on the rtVAX300 processor daugh-
 ter module, which contains a 2.7 VUP CMOS processor, a CMOS VAX floating-
 point coprocessor, a CMOS second-generation Ethernet coprocessor, VSB,
 optional SCSI controller, and 4 MB or 16 MB of memory.

 With the KAV30, a user can put a VAX on the VMEbus, integrating the
 application into Digital Equipment Corporation's extensive computing
 and networking environment. Data can be communicated to and from de-
 vices on a DECnet or TCP/IP network, providing a means of total in-
 tegration from the realtime device to the data center.

 For the KAV30, the user develops the application on a VAX/VMS Host De-
 velopment System using the VAXELN Toolkit and the VAXELN KAV Toolkit
 Extensions. The application can then be built into a VAXELN Target Sys-
 tem, which can be down-line loaded into a KAV30 over an Ethernet, booted
 from SCSI disk, or booted from EPROM.

 Since the VAXELN KAV30 Toolkit Extensions are an extension to the VAX-
 ELN Toolkit, users have the features and benefits standard with VAX-
 ELN. In addition, the VAXELN KAV30 Toolkit Extensions provides soft-
 ware to simplify the programming of the KAV30 module. It provides ker-
 nel procedures to initialize the KAV30 module, set up and control ac-
 cess to VME and VSB devices, set up and control communication FIFOs,
 write and read Nonvolatile RAM, utilize ASTs in user-written device

 drivers, and initialize the KAV30 module. The KAV30 software also in-
 cludes asynchronous event notification (ASTs) for the realtime clock
 and timers.
