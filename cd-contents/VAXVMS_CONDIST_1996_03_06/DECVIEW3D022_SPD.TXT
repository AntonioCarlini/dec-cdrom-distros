 PRODUCT NAME:  DECview3D for VMS[*], Version 2.2       SPD 26.95.06

 DESCRIPTION

 DECview3D is a software tool used for display, review, markup, anal-
 ysis, and manipulation of engineering graphics created by CAD (Com-
 puter Aided Design) packages. It combines data translation, snapshot
 generation,and LiveLinks to DECwrite Compound Document Editor. DECview3D
 can be used to integrate engineering graphics into other applications,
 or as a standalone tool for display and review of those graphics.

 DECview3D runs under VMS DECwindows and adheres to the XUI Style Guide.
 It has the same look and feel as other Digital developed DECwindows
 applications. DECview3D also supports graphics terminals such as VT240,
 VT241, VT330, and VT340.

 Features

 Input Translation

 DECview3D can read and translate files that conform to the following
 formats:

 o  IGES (Initial Graphics Exchange Specification)
    DECview3D reads and translates files that conform to the IGES V5.0
    specification and contains those entity types and forms supported
    by DECview3D.


 ____________________

 The   terms OpenVMS and VMS refer to the OpenVMS operating system.

                                                         AE-FR99G-TE

 

 o  HP-GL[R] Plot Files
    DECview3D reads and translates HP-GL 7475 Plot formatted files. All
    non-shading plotting commands and all non-plotter specific initial-
    ization and settings commands are supported.

 o  Calcomp[R] 960 Files
    DECview3D reads and translates Calcomp 960 Plot formatted files.

 The list of supported IGES entities, HP-GL, and Calcomp 960 plot com-
 mands is provided in the DECview3D Reference Manual. Display and Ma-
 nipulation Features

 DECview3D allows the user to create one or many LAYOUTS in a DECview3D
 file. A LAYOUT displays the graphics that have been translated into
 DECview3D and keeps a record of how they were manipulated, sized, po-
 sitioned, or annotated during any working session. Users can navigate
 through the LAYOUTS contained in a DECview3D file and control the dis-
 play of the LAYOUT with PAN and ZOOM operations.

 Graphics that are translated into DECview3D are displayed in VIEWPORTS
 on a layout. Each layout can contain one or many VIEWPORTS. Users con-
 trol the display of the graphics using a selection of PAN, ZOOM, and
 ROTATE operations. Any PAN, ZOOM, and ROTATE combination can be stored
 in a user-defined VIEW. User-defined VIEWS can be added to the list
 of pre-defined VIEWS which are available in DECview3D. Pre-defined views
 are FRONT, BACK, LEFT, RIGHT, TOP, BOTTOM, ISOMETRIC, and TRIMETRIC.
 The SELECT VIEW command allows the user to apply defined views to a
 graphic in DECview3D.

 The BLANK ENTITY function is used to simplify the display of complex
 3D wireframe graphics by removing part entities from the display. LAYER
 OPERATIONS allow different layers contained in the original CAD graphic
 to be switched off or on.

 Markup Operations

 Users can annotate or markup layouts with text information and graphic
 objects and symbols. These markups can be moved, deleted, copied, or
 customized by changing specific markup attributes.

 Color Support

 Files translated into DECview3D display the original application color
 definition, limited by the capability of the display device. The DECview3D
 color table can be changed by the user to alter the display of the trans-
 lated file. Color changes are reflected in the snapshot file formats,
 limited by the capability of the output device. Analysis Functions

 Users can obtain geometry information from the drawing entities which
 can be displayed and reviewed, stored in a text file, mailed to other
 users, or included as a text annotation on a DECview3D layout. The SE-
 LECTION FILTER can be customized to help users control the scope of
 the entity search.

 o  Part Entity Analysis provides geometry and coordinate information
    about drawing entities, e.g., Lines, Arcs, Polylines.

 o  Distance provides 3D shortest distance and 2D delta values between
    selected Lines, Arcs, or Point drawing entities.

 Snapshot Generation

 A SNAPSHOT is a file containing a 2D representation of a specified lay-
 out, portion of a layout, or selected VIEWPORT. It shows the drawings
 and any markups the user has added. Snapshot files can be used for pro-
 ducing hardcopies or for integration into other applications. The fol-
 lowing snapshot formats are supported in DECview3D:

 o  DDIF - Digital's Document Interchange Format

 o  Sixel

 o  ReGIS

 o  HP-GL

 o  Interleaf[R] ASCII

 o  GKS-metafile

 o  CGM

 o  Tektronix[R] 4014 protocol

                                  3

 

 o  Encapsulated PostScript[R]

 o  Color PostScript

 o  Color Encapsulated PostScript

 User Interface

 All DECview3D functions are available through pull down menus or through
 the Application Command Line interface. The Application Command Line
 commands can also be used to record the events of a DECview3D session
 in a script file. Script files can be edited and replayed. Users can
 create their own script file with an editor and use it within a DECview3D
 session. Application Command Line commands can be used in initializa-
 tion files to customize the DECview3D session.

 VT Support

 On VT330 and VT340 terminals, the mouse is supported as an input de-
 vice. Both Application Command Line and menu interfaces are supported.

 On VT240 and VT241 terminals, user interaction is through the Appli-
 cation Command Line only.

 The user interface also features two levels of Help:

 o  Menu
    Menu Help (located in the Main Menu) provides the user with an overview
    of DECview3D, its functionality, and generic instructions relat-
    ing to DECview3D formats and commands.

 o  General
    General Help (available at the VMS level) provides an overview of
    the system and instructions to run DECview3D.

 LiveLink

 DECview3D can be invoked from the LiveLink capability available in DECwrite
 and DECpresent. With LiveLinks, graphics from DECview3D can become part
 of a DECwrite document and may be automatically updated when the doc-
 ument is next edited. These updates can be controlled by the user so

                                  4

 

 they occur only when desired. Links from DECwrite to DECview3D can be
 modified or deleted.

 DECview3D supports links to external CAD files. If the user selects
 the LINK TO GRAPHIC option, this ensures that the latest version of
 the external CAD file is always translated whenever the DECview3D Lay-
 out file is edited. Links from DECview3D to external CAD files can be
 modified or deleted.

 High-Quality Output

 DECview3D provides high-quality output to Digital PostScript print-
 ers such as the PrintServer 20 and PrintServer 40. In addition, it sup-
 ports the LN03, LN01S, and LN03 PLUS printers.
