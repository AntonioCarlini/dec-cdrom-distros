 PRODUCT NAME:  SQL Multimedia for DEC Rdb Version 1.1  SPD 36.01.02
                for OpenVMS VAX and AXP Systems

 DESCRIPTION

 SQL Multimedia for DEC Rdb for OpenVMS VAX and AXP operating systems
 is an advanced software solution for manipulating, storing, and re-
 trieving multimedia objects from client applications that work with
 DEC Rdb databases. SQL Multimedia Development for DEC Rdb and SQL Mul-
 timedia Run-time for DEC Rdb offer a productive, cost effective, stan-
 dard method for managing multimedia objects.

 SQL Multimedia Development for DEC Rdb is a Network Application Sup-
 port (NAS) service consisting of software libraries of callable rou-
 tines that give SQL applications and SQL/Services client-based appli-
 cations the ability to insert and fetch multimedia data objects into
 and from DEC Rdb databases.

 SQL Multimedia Run-time for DEC Rdb provides a run-time license that
 allows access to multimedia objects stored in DEC Rdb databases through
 the use of the SQL Multimedia software library. This license supports
 access through both SQL and SQL Services compatible interfaces. By us-
 ing SQL/Services, SQL Multimedia provides a powerful client/server en-
 vironment that supports DEC Rdb as the database server and the OpenVMS,
 ULTRIX for RISC, MS-DOS[R], Microsoft[R] Windows[TM], and Macintosh[R] client
 environments.

 This product is intended to be used by software programmers who write
 application programs that will be used with a DEC Rdb database. With
 this product, software developers (including database application pro-
 grammers, document management system designers, and database or computer-
 aided system engineering (CASE) tools developers) can use any DEC Rdb
 database to store multimedia objects, as well as traditional relational
 data types (numbers and characters). Tools developers can also use SQL

 Multimedia to add multimedia object support to existing database and
 fourth-generation language tools, and to build new tools to support
 multimedia objects.

 To define the DEC Rdb multimedia data types, programmers use standard
 data definition language (DDL) statements of the SQL-compatible in-
 terface to DEC Rdb. This allows definition of tables that contain COM-
 POUND DOCUMENT, IMAGE, TABLE, TEXT, and BLOB (Binary Large Object) class
 objects in DEC Rdb columns. Standard DDL statements enable database
 designers to map multimedia objects to separate DEC Rdb storage ar-
 eas on different disks. Multimedia objects can be stored on WORM (write-
 once, read-many) optical disks in either a standalone drive or juke-
 box[1] configurations supported by DEC Rdb. (Refer to the DEC Rdb Soft-
 ware Product Descriptions: DEC Rdb for VAX (SPD 25.59.xx), DEC Rdb for
 AXP (SPD 45.47.xx.))

 By providing the ability to store the multimedia objects in the database,
 SQL Multimedia offers the following advantages:

 o  Data integrity

 o  Concurrent access

 o  Security

 o  Simplified data maintenance

 o  Transparent access to multiple storage devices

 o  Standard storage format for multimedia objects

 o  Shared data across applications

 Features

 SQL Multimedia defines and operates on five different data object classes:

 o  COMPOUND DOCUMENT class in DDIF, the Digital Document Interchange
    Format

 ____________________
 A   jukebox is a device that consists of one or more racks that hold
   optical disks, one or more optical disk drives, and a robotic mech-

   anism that transfers disks between racks and a disk drive.

                                  2

 

 o  IMAGE class in DDIF/Image or DECimage ISL Image Frame Format

 o  TABLE class in DTIF, the Digital Table Interchange Format

 o  TEXT class in record delimited, 8-bit byte streams

 o  BLOB class in independent, application-defined format

 In addition to the preceding formats for the various object classes,
 users can also specify application-specific or user-defined formats
 for each object class. For example, if an application does not use DDIF
 images, the user can store the image as an IMAGE object and specify
 the format (for example, TIFF) for that image during the insert op-
 eration. An application can also fetch legacy data (segmented string
 data that was stored independently of SQL Multimedia) from the database.
 In such cases, the application must interpret the retrieved legacy ob-
 ject because SQL Multimedia will have no knowledge of its contents.

 SQL Multimedia provides the ability to add compound documents, image,
 table, text, and application-specific data objects to existing database
 applications, as well as to build them into new database applications.

 Multimedia objects to be inserted into and fetched from a database can
 be retrieved from or deposited to any one of the following locations
 that can act as either a source or a destination:

 o  An entire object in main memory

 o  An object buffered to main memory via data streams

 o  A file

 SQL Multimedia provides the following callable interfaces:

 o  SQL-compatible interface to the DEC Rdb database product

 o  SQL/Services-compatible interfaces from client platforms to the DEC
    Rdb database server


                                  3

 

 The SQL/Services compatible interface enables a user to access a mul-
 timedia database from the following distributed desktop client envi-
 ronment:

 -  OpenVMS client environment on VAX and Alpha AXP hardware

 -  ULTRIX client environment on reduced instruction set computer (RISC)

 -  MS-DOS client environment on IBM[R]-compatible personal computers

 -  Microsoft Windows client environment on IBM-compatible personal com-
    puters

 -  MPW[TM] and THINK C client environments on Macintosh hardware

 Optionally, SQL Multimedia can facilitate desktop to jukebox integra-
 tion when used with the following hardware and software:

 o  A DEC Rdb database:

    -  For a VAX system: DEC Rdb for OpenVMS VAX V 5.0 (SPD 25.59.xx)

    -  For an Alpha AXP system: DEC Rdb for OpenVMS AXP V 5.0 (SPD 45.47.xx)

 o  An optical disk software interface[2]

 o  A supported client hardware and software environment

 o  A write-once, read-many (WORM) device, standalone or jukebox con-
    figuration

 SQL Multimedia, in conjunction with DEC Rdb, provides users with the
 following abilities:

 o  Define a table where one or more columns in the table contain a COM-
    POUND DOCUMENT, IMAGE, TABLE, TEXT, or BLOB class object that is
    mapped to the native SQL data type, LIST OF BYTE VARYING

 o  Insert and fetch objects defined by SQL Multimedia within the scope
    of a database transaction

 ____________________
 The   optical disk software interface must model write-once, read-many

   (WORM) devices as standard OpenVMS magnetic disks on VAX hardware.

                                  4

 

 o  Fetch segmented string data that was stored independently of SQL
    Multimedia

 o  Compress and decompress image DDIF objects as part of the insert
    and fetch operations on OpenVMS and ULTRIX clients[3]

 o  Generate and store multiple revisable forms of IMAGE class objects
    and permit individual renditions to be fetched

 o  Access a DEC Rdb database that contains these supported objects from
    distributed client environments, via SQL/Services
