     PRODUCT NAME:  DEC Remote Operation Service         SPD 32.90.00
                    Development Kit for VMS, Version 4.0

     DESCRIPTION

     DEC Remote Operation Service Development Kit for VMS is a
     software package that facilitates the development of appli-
     cations using DEC Remote Operation Service (DECros) for VMS
     (SPD 32.89.xx). The DECros Development Kit comprises an Ab-
     stract Syntax Notation 1 (ASN.1) cross-compiler called PLC409,
     Version 4.0. PLC409 is a product developed by MARBEN, S.A.,
     and is distributed under a Digital Distributed Software (DDS)
     agreement.

     PLC409 allows the cross-compilation of ASN.1 macros and data
     descriptions into "C" Programming Language, according to the
     International Standard Organization (ISO) standard IS 8824.
     PLC409 further allows the encoding/decoding of the resulting
     application variables according to Basic Encoding Rules (BER)
     defined in the ISO standard IS 8825. PLC409 is also compatible
     with the equivalent X.208 and X.209 International Telegraph and
     Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT) Recommendations.

     Features

     The major features of PLC409 are:

     o  ASN.1 macro and data description cross-compiler

        The PLC409 cross-compiler allows the expansion of ASN.1 macro
        notations, analyses, and verifies the ASN.1 data types,
        allows the merging of several ASN.1 descriptions compiled
        separately, and generates the corresponding "C" Programming
        Language data structures as well as the corresponding BER

        encoding/decoding routine. More specifically, the ASN.1
        cross-compiler is composed of the following components:

        -  ASN.1 Macro Preprocessor

           The Macro Preprocessor performs lexical and syntactical
           analysis of ASN.1 macro definitions and references to
           macros. The preprocessor then expands the macros into
           ASN.1 data structures, while signaling possible errors and
           warnings.

        -  ASN.1 Data Structure Analyzer

           The Data Structure Analyzer performs lexical and syn-
           tactical analysis of ASN.1 data structures. After a full
           semantical analysis to ensure ASN.1 tag consistency, the
           analyzer outputs an Intermediate Form file, and eventual
           error and warning messages.

        -  Linker

           The Linker produces a single Intermediate Form file out of
           several such files, resolving external references.

        -  "C" Programming Language Generator

           The C Language Generator translates an Intermediate Form
           file with no external references into the corresponding C
           data structures.

     o  ASN.1 Data Encoding/Decoding Environment

        The Data Encoding/Decoding Environment provides facilities to
        encode and decode actual data according to the Basic Encoding
        Rules (BER), and includes a memory management system.

        -  The general encoding/decoding engines allow efficient
           and safe encoding and decoding of actual data accord-
           ing to BER, while providing verification and debugging
           facilities.

           The engines are configured using the encoding/decoding
           matrixes output by the compiler's C Generator and are
           totally independent from the ASN.1 data structures.

        -  The Memory Management System allows for efficient use of
           a memory section, broken down into buffers. The Memory
           Management System allows the following operations:

           Allocate/Release Buffer
           Read/Write Byte
           Assemble/Fragment Buffer
           Extend/Truncate Buffer
