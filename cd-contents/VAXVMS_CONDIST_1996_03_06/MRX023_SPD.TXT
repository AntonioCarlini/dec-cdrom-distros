 PRODUCT NAME:  VAX Message Router X.400 Gateway, Version 2.3    SPD
 27.50.06

 DESCRIPTION

 VAX Message Router X.400 (MRX) Gateway is a network server layered soft-
 ware product that resides on an OpenVMS[TM] VAX[TM] system and pro-
 vides interconnection between MAILbus[TM] (Digital Equipment Corpo-
 ration's Message Router-based electronic message transfer service) and
 a CCITT 1984 X.400 Message Handling System. Together, VAX Message Router
 X.400 Gateway and VAX Message Router (MR) form a Message Transfer Agent
 conforming to the CCITT 1984 X.400 Series of Recommendations for Mes-
 sage Handling Systems, and can act as either a Private Management Do-
 main (private messaging network) or an Administration Management Do-
 main (public messaging network).

 The MRX Gateway allows users of systems connected to MAILbus (for ex-
 ample, user agents such as DEC MAILworks[TM] or ALL-IN-1[TM] Integrated
 Office System) to communicate with users of X.400 Message Handling Sys-
 tems. Users of systems connected through other gateways to MAILbus can
 also access the MRX Gateway and systems connected through it. The MRX
 Gateway can be connected to an X.400 Gateway from another system ven-
 dor, to an X.400 Private Management Domain, or to an X.400 Adminis-
 tration Management Domain. Applications such as DEC/EDI (Digital's Elec-
 tronic Data Interchange) software can also use MRX as a connection to
 public and private networks.

 The VAX Message Router X.400 Gateway interworks with systems that con-
 form to the CCITT X.400 1984 recommendations as defined in the pro-
 files produced by:

 VAX Message Router X.400 Gateway, Version 2.3         SPD 27.50.06

 o  Stable Implementation Agreements for Open Systems Interconnection
    Protocols: Part 7 - 1984 Message Handling Systems, Output from De-
    cember 1992 OSI Implementors Workshop (NIST - National Institute
    of Science and Technology).

 o  CEN/CENELEC ENV 41 201 (profile(A/3211) for private domains)

 o  CEN/CENELEC ENV 41 202 (profile(A/311) for administration domains)

 These profiles are not uniform and where differences exist, the prod-
 uct follows the NIST profile. Some restrictions on the level of ser-
 vice obtained between message originator and recipient may apply if
 all the systems involved in the message transfer do not conform to the
 X.400 Recommendations.

 Standards Conformance

 VAX Message Router X.400 Gateway, Version 2.3, is being submitted for
 conformance testing by an accredited testing institution.

 The previous version (V2.2G) of VAX Message Router X.400 Gateway suc-
 cessfully completed conformance testing according to the European ENV
 41202 (A/311 profile and U.K. GOSIP profile). The conformance test-
 ing was carried out by the United Kingdom National Computing Centre,
 an accredited Open Systems Test Consortium (OSTC) Eurolab, who pro-
 duced OSTC test reports, which are valid in all European Community Mem-
 ber states. This prior version (V2.2G) of VAX Message Router X.400 Gate-
 way has been registered by NIST as conformant to the U.S. GOSIP Ver-
 sion 1.0 profile and has been certified, by the Deutsche Bundespost
 Telekom, as being in compliance with the following standards:

 o  CCITT series X.400 Version 1984 and

 o  ENV 41 202 (ADMD) Version 1987

 Please contact your local Digital[TM] office for information on the
 conformance status, test reports and registration.

 Message Content Conversion

 The MRX Gateway provides translation and conversion services between
 the NIST/NBS protocols and service elements of MAILbus and those spec-
 ified by the X.400 Recommendations. Message content conversion is also
 performed by MRX. Digital's WPS-PLUS[TM], DECdx[TM], ASCII (Digital
 Multi-National Character Set), DDIF (Digital Document Interchange For-
 mat) and text document formats are converted to IA5, Teletex or ISO
 6937 formats when passed from the MAILbus to the X.400 network. IA5,
 Teletex or ISO 6937 documents received from the X.400 network are passed
 into MAILbus as ASCII (Digital Multi-National Character Set) text files.

 With the addition of the DEC ODA (Office Document Architecture) Com-
 pound Document Architecture (CDA) Gateway for OpenVMS (SPD 32.10.xx),
 a set of document conversion routines which reconcile Digital's Com-
 pound Document Architecture and the ISO Office Document Architecture,
 DDIF documents can be passed into the X.400 network as OdaBodyPart (Tag
 12) messages; as defined in the NIST Stable Implementation Agreements
 for Open Systems Interconnection Protocols, Version 6, 1992. In the
 reverse direction, ODA documents are converted into DDIF format for
 onward transmission through MAILbus.

 The MRX Gateway also supports the transmission and receipt of binary
 data using the Undefined BodyPart (Tag 14) feature described in the
 CCITT X.400-Series Implementor's Guide, 1986 and the NIST Stable Im-
 plementation Agreements for Open Systems Interconnection Protocols,
 Version 6, 1992. The product documentation describes the capabilities
 and limitations of binary file transfer using the MRX Gateway.

 Unconverted transmission and receipt of WPS-PLUS and all Digital RMS
 file formats directly to and from another domain with which a bilat-
 eral agreement has been made and which also uses VAX Message Router
 X.400 Gateway for the connection is possible using the USABodyPart (Tag
 310), as described in the NIST Stable Implementation Agreements for
 Open Systems Interconnection Protocols, Version 6, 1992.

 Conversion alternatives are chosen on a gateway wide basis during the
 configuration process for VAX Message Router X.400 Gateway.

 The VAX Message Router X.400 Gateway is designed to conform with U.S.
 GOSIP, Version 1.0 and U.K. GOSIP, Version 3.1.

 The Directory Service (DDS), part of VAX Message Router, is used for
 address translation between X.400 Originator/Recipient (O/R) Names and
 MAILbus addresses when messages are transferred to or from the X.400
 network. This directory is also used to authorize originators of out-
 going messages to the X.400 network.

 The MRX Gateway may use either an X.25 wide area network link or an
 IEEE 802.3/ISO 8802-3/Ethernet local area network to communicate with:

 o  Another X.400 Gateway (back-to-back) within the same network

 o  Another vendor's X.400 MTA within the same network

 o  A private domain (from a private or administration domain)

 o  An administration domain (from a private or administration domain)

 SOFTWARE PRODUCT SERVICES

 MAILbus products are components of larger distributed messaging ap-
 plications, which may involve multiple vendors' systems in multiple
 locations. Digital offers a number of consulting services to assist
 customers in the planning, installation, and management of these mes-
 saging applications and related directory services, integration of PC-
 based messaging systems, and the provision of network-wide directory
 services.

 A variety of service options are available from Digital. For more in-
 formation, contact your local Digital office.

 SOFTWARE WARRANTY

 Warranty for this software product is provided by Digital with the pur-
 chase of a license for the product as defined in the Software Warranty
 Addendum of this SPD.

 Warranty Limitations

 Achievement of the full level of messaging services specified in the
 CCITT 1984 X.400 Recommendations is only possible if all systems in-
 volved in the origination, transfer and delivery of a message conform
 to those X.400 Recommendations.

 Absolute fidelity between an original document and the resulting doc-
 ument as printed or displayed by the receiving system is not guaran-
 teed. The differences between vendors' approaches to word processing
 systems, the transformations required for the transfer and printing
 of a document, and the types of printers used may all affect the re-
 sulting printed document.
