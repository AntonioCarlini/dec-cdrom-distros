 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

 MAILbus 400[TM] Application Program Interface (API) for OpenVMS[TM]
 is a layered software product that resides on an OpenVMS VAX[TM] sys-
 tem. It provides a programming interface that gives application de-
 velopment programmers access to the messaging services provided by the
 MAILbus 400 Message Transfer Agent.

 MAILbus 400 API for OpenVMS provides a C language interface to the MAIL-
 bus 400 MTA's messaging services. An ANSI C conformant compiler is re-
 quired to use the MAILbus 400 API.

 A MAILbus 400 Application Program Interface license is required for
 application development only. An application built using MAILbus 400
 Application Program Interface can be operated without the need for a
 MAILbus 400 Application Program Interface license.

 MAILbus 400 API can operate either collocated with MAILbus 400 MTA or
 on a remote OpenVMS machine.

 CONFORMANCE TO STANDARDS

 MAILbus 400 API for OpenVMS is an implementation of the X/Open[TM] CAE
 Specification - OSI-Abstract-Data-Manipulation (November 1991 edition),
 and the X/Open CAE Specification - API to Electronic Mail (November
 1991 edition). These specifications define a vendor-independent pro-
 gramming interface to X.400 messaging services; however, applications
 linked with the MAILbus 400 API can only communicate directly with the
 MAILbus 400 MTA. MAILbus 400 API provides both the Application and Gate-
 way interfaces defined by the X/Open CAE Specifications.

 MAILbus 400 API for OpenVMS does not support the Retrieval Functional
 Unit of the X/Open CAE Specification - API to Electronic Mail.
