           PRODUCT NAME:  DEC Rdb Language Translators   SPD 33.98.00
			  for VMS, Version 1.0

           DESCRIPTION

           DEC Rdb Language Translators is a tool that translates RDBPRE
           and RDML application programs to SQL module language. It con-
           verts source code, written in a host language containing em-
           bedded RDBPRE or RDML statements, into a similar program in
           the same host language that calls SQL module language rou-
           tines. It assists in migrating applications from RDML and
           RDBPRE to SQL.
           Features

           o  Translates RDBPRE programs written in FORTRAN, COBOL and
              BASIC, and RDML programs written in Pascal and C.

           o  Generates host language source program and SQL module lan-
              guage procedures, and compilation listing. The user must
              compile the translated source files using the appropri-
              ate programming language compiler.

           o  Due to inherent differences between the languages of the
              Rdb/VMS preprocessors (RDBPRE and RDML) and SQL module
              language, certain clauses and statements will not trans-
              late. In most cases where a clause or statement cannot
              be translated, diagnostic output is produced to facil-
              itate the remainder of the translation process.

           o  RDBPRE and RDML programs using transaction handles are
              translated using two-phase-commit support.
