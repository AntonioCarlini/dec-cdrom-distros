           36.26.00                Version 1.0

           DESCRIPTION

           The LinkWorks Developer's Tools for VMS is a set of devel-
           opment tools for creating, modifying, and maintaining hy-
           perapplications. A hyperapplication is an application that
           participates in a DECwindows LinkWorks environment. Hyper-
           applications provide linking and navigation capabilities to
           application end users through a new Link menu. LinkWorks sup-
           port can be added to existing applications, and new appli-
           cations can be designed with LinkWorks support included from
           the beginning.

           This LinkWorks Developer's Tools release includes the fol-
           lowing components:

           o  LinkWorks Services definitions

           o  Linkable LinkWorks Services

           o  Linkbase Utility (LBASE)

           o  HyperFiles sample hyperapplication (source files and build
              procedure)

           o  LinkWorks Developer's Guide

           The LinkWorks Services definitions are the application pro-
           gramming interfaces (APIs) in a variety of programming lan-
           guages; C, Ada, FORTRAN, and Pascal.

           Version 1.0

           The linkable LinkWorks Services are a collection of callable
           routines that enable applications to participate in a LinkWorks
           Environment. These services provide generic user interface
           and information object manipulation capabilities.

           The Linkbase Utility (LBASE) is a testing and debugging tool
           intended for developers. It is a command-driven utility for
           manipulating LinkWorks linkbases.

           HyperFiles is a sample hyperapplication provided as a pro-
           gramming example.

           The LinkWorks Developer's Guide provides detailed tutorial
           and reference material about providing LinkWorks support in
           a DECwindows application.
