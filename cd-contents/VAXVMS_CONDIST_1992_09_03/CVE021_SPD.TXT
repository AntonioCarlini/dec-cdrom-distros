           PRODUCT NAME:  DECview3D Concurrent View     SPD 31.35.00
                          and Edit Module for VMS, 
                          Version 2.1

           DESCRIPTION

           The DECview3D Concurrent View and Edit Module for VMS al-
           lows two users of the DECview3D software, linked by DECnet
           communications, to work simultaneously on the same DECview3D
           layout file. Users of the Concurrent View and Edit software
           have access to all DECview3D functions and pass control of
           the application back and forth. The results of all appli-
           cation operations are displayed on both users' DECwindows
           workstations.

           DECview3D is a software tool used for display, review, markup,
           analysis, and manipulation of engineering graphics created
           by CAD (Computer Aided Design) packages. It combines data
           translation, snapshot generation and LiveLinks to the DECwrite
           Compound Document Editor. DECview3D can be used to integrate
           engineering graphics into other applications, or as a standalone
           tool for display and review of those graphics. Refer to DECview3D
           for VMS Software Product Description (SPD 26.95.xx) for a
           complete product description.

           The DECview3D Concurrent View and Edit Module for VMS fa-
           cilitates the review of engineering designs among distributed
           work groups and team members.

           DECview3D Concurrent View and Edit Module for VMS runs un-
           der VMS DECwindows and adheres to the XUI Style Guide. It
           has the same look and feel as other Digital developed DECwin-
           dows applications.

           Features

           Originator Commands

           The Originator is the user who starts the DECview3D Concur-
           rent View and Edit session. The following qualifiers can be
           used by the Originator when starting the session:

           o  /FILE specifies the file to be viewed. The software prompts
              the user for a filename if none is specified.

           o  /[NO]COPY_FILE determines whether the DECview3D layout
              file to be viewed will be copied from the Originator's
              directory to the Concurrent User's directory.

           o  /NODE specifies the node on which the other concurrent
              session will run. This can be specified as a valid node
              name or DECnet address. The DECview3D Concurrent View and
              Edit module prompts the user for a node name if none is
              specified.

           o  /DISPLAY /SERVER and /SCREEN qualifiers can be used to
              specify the the display, server, or screen where the con-
              current session will be displayed.

           Concurrent User

           The Concurrent User participates in the DECview3D concur-
           rent session and can request control of the application at
           any time using the control box. DECview3D Concurrent View
           and Edit checks that the DECview3D files being viewed are
           identical.

           Log Files

           DECview3D Concurrent View and Edit maintains a log file of
           each concurrent session. This log file includes the date and
           time the concurrent session started, the originator's node
           and name, the concurrent user's node and name, and the name(s)
           of the file(s) being viewed. During a concurrent session,

           either user may enter text into the Log File via the con-
           trol box. Log files can be edited using a standard text ed-
           itor.

           Application Control

           Users take turns controlling the application. Control of the
           DECview3D software is first owned by the originator of the
           session. The control box appears on both users' screens for
           the duration of the concurrent session, and indicates which
           user can execute DECview3D commands. Control can be requested
           by and passed to the other user.
