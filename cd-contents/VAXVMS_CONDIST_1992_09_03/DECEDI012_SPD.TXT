 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC/EDI, Version 1.2                    SPD 31.70.02

 DESCRIPTION

 DEC/EDI offers application developers all the facilities necessary for
 Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). It enables users to electronically
 exchange structured business documents such as Purchase Orders, Dis-
 patch Advice, and Invoices with their Trading Partners using Inter-
 national, National, and Industry-specific EDI standards. Extensive com-
 munication options are also provided to facilitate inter-enterprise
 communication via the use of either EDI VANs or OSI protocols.

 DEC/EDI is a VMS layered product. DEC/EDI consists of the following
 components and Service which provide a complete EDI solution:

 o  DEC/EDI Application Component

 o  DEC/EDI Translation Component

 o  DEC/EDI Communications Component

 o  DEC/EDI Management Service

 DEC/EDI can be configured such that each of the components can be lo-
 cated together on the same processor or distributed around the enter-
 prise on different processors, using Digital's networking products,
 to provide an enterprise-wide EDI system. Multiple copies of these com-
 ponents can also be deployed across the enterprise, on different pro-
 cessors, to implement an EDI system ideally suited for the business
 needs of the enterprise.

 DEC/EDI Application Component

                               DIGITAL                     June 1992

                                                         AE-PBHLC-TE

 

 The Application Component enables the user to integrate existing and
 new applications to DEC/EDI and transfer data to, or receive data from,
 Trading Partners via the DEC/EDI Translation Component. It is a pro-
 gramming interface and consists of a set of nine callable routines.
 These routines are independent of the EDI standard.

 Working examples of programs in COBOL and BASIC programming languages
 are provided to illustrate how an application program is interfaced
 to the DEC/EDI system.

 The Application Component provides the following features:

 o  The ability to define default values for sub-elements and data el-
    ements to minimize the programming effort

 o  A return value to indicate the success or reason for failure of the
    called routine

 o  Routing functions to enable transmission of data from an Applica-
    tion Component to any number of Translation Components to facil-
    itate enterprise-wide EDI

 o  Routing functions to enable transmission of data directly to any
    number of additional Application Components to facilitate intra-
    enterprise EDI

 o  Event and Error logging

 o  Transparency from communications details

 DEC/EDI Translation Component

 The Translation Component performs the transformation process that con-
 verts the user application data definitions received from the Appli-
 cation Component into standard EDI formats and parses standard EDI for-
 mats, received from the Communications Component, into user-defined
 data definitions.

 The Translation Component provides the following features:

 o  Routing functions to enable transmission of data to any number of
    Communications Components and Application Components

                                  2

 

 o  Support for multiple versions of message standards

 o  Supports the transmission of 8-bit national character sets

 o  Compliance checking at Trading Partner level

 o  Trading Partner specific Code Translation

 o  User-selectable control number generation

 o  Test transmissions

 o  Event and Error logging

 An editor is provided which enables users to customize the messages,
 either delivered with the product or provided through the DEC/EDI Mes-
 sage Update Kit, to create new messages for industry specific and Trad-
 ing Partner specific messages, including new versions, based on ANSI
 X12, TDCC, EDIFACT, ODETTE, and TRADACOMS[TM] syntax rules supported
 by this version of the product.

 Trading Partner agreement details, including the message formats be-
 ing used, are recorded in the Trading Partner Profiles. The Transla-
 tion Component uses the information in the Trading Partner Profiles
 and the Message Database to perform compliance checking and to check
 the validity of the transaction.

 The Translation Component provides support for the following EDI stan-
 dards:

 o  ANSI X12

    -  Automatic generation of Functional Acknowledgments and recon-
       ciliation of Functional Acknowledgments

    -  Supports industry-specific transactions adhering to the ANSI X12
       syntax

 o  TDCC

    -  Supports all modes including UCS/WINS

    -  Automatic generation of Functional Acknowledgments, 997 and 999
       and reconciliation of Functional Acknowledgments

                                  3

 

    -  Support for the following types of messages is not provided:

       *  Messages which contain two mandatory instances of the same
          segment, at the same level, when other segments appear be-
          tween the two instances (e.g., Transaction 994 and its use
          of the K2 segment)

       *  Messages which use EDIFACT enveloping

 o  EDIFACT

    -  Implements ISO 9735

    -  Supports character set A, lower-case a-z, and 8-bit national char-
       acter sets.

    -  Supports industry-specific transactions adhering to the EDIFACT
       ISO 9735 syntax

 o  ODETTE

    -  Support for Version 2.0 of ODETTE

 o  TRADACOMS

    -  Implements the TRADACOMS (October 1989 Update) syntax and mes-
       sages

 DEC/EDI Communications Component

 The Communications Component supports a range of communications op-
 tions including OSI. It enables users to send EDI transmissions ei-
 ther through third-party EDI Services or directly to their Trading Part-
 ners.

 o  Flexible scheduling using windows and jobs

 o  Priority processing to override the scheduler

 o  User-definable connection and file-based retry limit

 o  Event and Error logging

                                  4
