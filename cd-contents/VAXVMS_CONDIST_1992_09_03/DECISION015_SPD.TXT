           PRODUCT NAME:  DECdecision, Version 1.5      SPD 25.G2.02

           DESCRIPTION

           DECdecision is a VMS, workstation-based, decision support
           application tool set that runs under the DECwindows Desktop 
           Environment.

           DECdecision is comprised of four major software components:
           Query for ad-hoc database queries, Calc for analyzing fi-
           nancial and business data, Chart for generating business graphs,
           and Builder for recording and automating repetitive tasks
           across components.

           DECdecision runs under the VMS DECwindows
           Motif[R] environment and incorporates its common appearance
           and operation for pull-down menus, dialog boxes, windows,
           component cut/paste operations, and mouse pointing device
           support. Therefore, DECdecision has a consistent appearance
           across the entire product, shared with other applications
           (such as DECwrite) written under DECwindows.

           Features

           DECquery (Database)

           Query is the database management component of DECdecision
           that provides distributed access to local and remote data,
           a simplified windowed approach to data query and manipula-
           tion, and personal database creation.

           graph, ASCII, and Lotus[R] WK1, WK3) source files. Chart has
           a Chartbook that presents the user with a sequence of pre-
           defined charts that can be further customized through leg-
           ends, grids, titles, etc. Chart offers a wide variety of 45
           chart styles based on the following basic graphics styles:
           Line, Area, Bar, Column, Histogram, Pie, Scatter, High-Low-
           Close, and Combination charts.

           Chart is comprised of:

           o  Graphic annotation - overlay: text, lines, rectangles,
              and arrowheads anywhere on a chart for emphasis and cus-
              tomization.

           o  Color on-screen support - assign color attributes to: axis,
              baseline, frame, grids, legend, tags, tick marks, col-
              umn and bar fills, and overlay objects.

              family, weight, and slant.

           DECdecision Builder (Procedure Automation Tool)

           Builder is the cross-application tape recorder of DECdeci-
           sion. Use Builder to record, store, and play back a series
           of frequently repeated operations.

           Builder is designed for users familiar with Calc, DECquery,
           and DECchart. In addition to recording the commands of the
           DECdecision components, users can also add the following to
           Builder blueprints:

           o  User Tools - other applications (for example, Mail) or
              command procedures that users define for use within a blueprint

           o  External Blueprints - previously recorded and saved blueprints
              that users use within another blueprint

           o  Variables - words or symbols that can take on different
              values during playback

           o  Flow Control Tools:

              -  Loops - allow users to play back an external blueprint
                 or user tool multiple times

              -  Decisions - allow parts of a blueprint to play back
                 conditionally, based on a user-defined expression (if-
                 then-else) involving variables

           DECdecision, Version 1.5                    SPD 25.G2.02


           Users can use Builder in the following ways:

           o  Automatic record mode-to record your actions in a blueprint.
              Use automatic record to record regularly performed tasks
              that involve multiple DECdecision components.

           o  Playback mode - to run a previously recorded blueprint.
              Users can replay a blueprint in interactive or background
              mode.

           o  Splice mode - to use automatic record and playback modes,
              simultaneously. Users can replay a recorded blueprint, pause 
              the playback, then modify the blueprint using automatic record.

           o  Manual edit - to manipulate blueprint objects or blueprint
              commands, directly. While manually editing, users can add
              user tools, loops, decisions, external blueprints, in-
              tegrated applications, data flow arrows, and control flow
              arrows to a blueprint. Or, users can directly edit the
              application commands that Builder recorded in an exist-
              ing blueprint.

           o  Debug mode - to examine the state of the applications by
              stepping through the execution of the blueprint.

           To help users learn about Builder, a set of pre-recorded blueprints
           are provided that show how Builder works and how the DECde-
           cision components work together with Builder. Each guided
           blueprint contains information boxes that appear before each
           major step of blueprint playback, explaining what is about
           to happen.

           System-wide Features
