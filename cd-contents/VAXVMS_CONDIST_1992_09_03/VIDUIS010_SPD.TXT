           PRODUCT NAME:  VAXcamera Software for VMS, Version 1.0 SPD
           33.43.00

           DESCRIPTION

           The VAXcamera product captures video images from a video source
           and sends the images to a VWS or DECwindows workstation lo-
           cated on a DECnet network. The VAXcamera product consists
           of the Video Image Server (VIS) hardware and two software
           packages, the Video Image Executive (VIX) and the Video Im-
           age Developer (VID).

           The Video Image Executive executes on the VAXcamera Video
           Image Server and is used in conjunction with the workstation-
           based software, the Video Image Developer. The Video Image
           Developer executes on an eight-plane Digital workstation.
           The VAXcamera Video Image Server converts video signals into
           digital data. The Video Image Executive, Video Image Devel-
           oper, and Video Image Server are offered as a combined hard-
           ware and software product.

           The Video Image Executive is used to control the VAXcamera
           Video Image Server through an easy-to-use menu-driven in-
           terface. With the Video Image Executive, users can capture,
           analyze, manipulate, and enhance video images from a num-
           ber of sources. Once an image is captured, it can be sent
           easily and quickly over a Local Area or Wide Area DECnet net-
           work to an eight-plane Digital workstation.

           The Video Image Developer is used on an eight-plane Digi-
           tal workstation to convert the raw image data from the Video
           Image Server to the workstation-dependent format. Prior to
           converting the image, the Video Image Developer pauses to
           allow the user to adjust the contrast and brightness of the

           image. When used in the DECwindows environment, images can
           then be used in other CDA-compliant applications, such as
           DECpresent and DECwrite.

           The VAXcamera product consists of the following hardware and
           software components:

           VAXcamera Hardware

           o  High Resolution Video Camera

           o  Character Cell Terminal

           o  RGB Monitor

           o  VAXcamera Video Image Server

           VAXcamera Software

           o  Video Image Executive

           o  Video Image Developer

           Video Image Executive

           The Video Image Executive is layered on Digital's VAXELN Re-
           altime operating environment. VAXELN insures fast, predictable
           performance for the Video Image Executive. The Video Image
           Executive menu is easy to use and includes options to per-
           form image analysis, sharpness filtering, image addition,
           subtraction, and averaging. Menu options allow users to dig-
           itize images in 2 to 128 distinct shades of gray. High qual-
           ity gray scale images can be produced containing 512 x 480
           pixels with up to 128 shades of gray. Once images are cap-
           tured and enhanced, they can be transmitted via Ethernet to
           any system on a Local Area or Wide Area DECnet network.

           The Video Image Executive contains a robust set of image en-
           hancement routines. These routines are grouped according to
           the following imaging functions:

           o  IMAGE DISPLAY - The image display options contain the ba-
              sic, most frequently performed imaging tasks, such as im-
              age capture, image storage and retrieval, and screen and
              buffer clearing.

           o  IMAGE TRANSFER - The image transfer options let users trans-
              fer images between the screen and buffer areas.

           o  IMAGE ENHANCEMENT - The image enhancement options allow
              users to adjust certain visual qualities of displayed im-
              ages. For example, the sharpness filter can be used to
              sharpen the image or users can select the contrast en-
              hancement option and adjust the image contrast.

           o  IMAGE ANALYSIS - The image analysis options involve the
              use of frame addition, averaging, subtraction, or false
              color to analyze images.

           o  SET-UP FUNCTIONS - The set-up functions allow users to
              set up the Video Image Server environment. Using these
              commands, users can verify the integrity of the system,
              activate the appropriate video input channel, and select
              the proper video signal synchronization mode.

           Video Image Developer

           The Video Image Developer is an image enhancement applica-
           tion that runs on any eight-plane Digital workstation in ei-
           ther VWS or DECwindows environments. The Video Image Devel-
           oper allows users to convert the raw image data from the Video
           Image Server to the workstation-dependent format.

           Video Image Developer provides the following features and
           functions:

           o  Displays the image taken with the VAXcamera Video Image
              Server on the workstation screen

           o  Allows users to make brightness and contrast enhancements
              to an image

           VAXcamera Software for VMS, Version 1.0     SPD 33.43.00


           o  Allows the user to store the VAXcamera image in a file
              format applicable to that workstation software, VWS as
              a .UIS metafile, or DECwindows as a .DDIF file

           From a workstation, these VAXcamera .UIS or .DDIF images can
           be transmitted via Ethernet to any system on a DECnet net-
           work, providing the capability for on-line distribution and
           viewing of information using VWS Render, DCL/IMAGE, or the
           CDA viewer.

           The Video Image Developer also provides capability for pro-
           ducing hardcopy output using a number of print devices that
           support SIXEL or PostScript® protocols.

           VWS Environment

           The Video Image Developer, in the VWS environment, produces
           a .UIS file that can then be Rendered to PostScript, SIXEL,
           and other data formats. The Video Image Developer contains
           the Picture Markup Utility (PMU), which is a special ver-
           sion of the VWS SIGHT graphic editor that allows importing
           of grayscale .UIS images. Using the Picture Markup Utility,
           users can overlay text and graphics on an image and save the
           image, along with the annotations, to a single file. The im-
           age itself, however, cannot be edited. The VWS version out-
           puts hardcopy to LA50, LA70, LA75, LA100, LA210, LA324, LN03,
           LN03 PLUS, LN03R, LN03Q, LPS20, and LPS40 printers.

           DECwindows Environment

           The Video Image Developer, in the DECwindows environment,
           has more built-in features than the VWS version. The Video
           Image Developer allows users to output the VAXcamera image
           in .DDIF format, PostScript and Encapsulated PostScript, VT240
           and VT340 SIXEL. The VAXcamera DDIF image files can be an-
           notated and included in compound documents such as DECwrite
           and DECpresent. The DECwindows version outputs hardcopy to
           LN03R, LN03Q, LPS20, LPS40, and most other PostScript de-
           vices.

           Video Image Server

           The Video Image Server captures and digitizes video images
           from an RS170 or, at a lesser quality, an NTSC video input
           source. Typical sources of video images can be a video cam-
           era, video cassette recorder (VCR), scanning electron mi-
           croscope (SEM), or an x-ray machine. Nearly any video sig-
           nal that conforms to RS170 or NTSC video standard can be dig-
           itized. Once the image has been captured, it can then be en-
           hanced via the Video Image Executive's video imaging rou-
           tine. The enhanced video image can then be sent over the Eth-
           ernet to any eight-plane VWS or DECwindows workstation lo-
           cated on the Local Area or Wide Area DECnet network.

           Figure 1 shows the VAXcamera Video Image Server (in the cen-
           ter) attached to a typical Ethernet configuration. The VAX-
           camera solution includes the VAXcamera Video Image Server,
           RGB Monitor, Character Cell Terminal, Camera, Video Image
           Executive and Video Image Developer software. Installation
           and training are optionally available.

           Note: The Load Host for the Video Image Server can be the
           "developer" workstation.
