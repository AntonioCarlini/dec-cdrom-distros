 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC RdbAccess for VAX RMS on VMS,       SPD 32.88.01
                Version 2.0

 DESCRIPTION

 DEC RdbAccess for VAX RMS on VMS (RdbAccess for VAX RMS) is a member
 of the DEC RdbAccess family of database interoperability products. It
 permits transparent, read and write access to VAX RMS files via the
 VAX Rdb/VMS implementation of the Structured Query Language, which im-
 plements the ANSI/ISO SQL standard. It also permits SQL read-only ac-
 cess to data sets on IBM[R] MVS systems via the DECnet/SNA Data Trans-
 fer Facility (DTF). RdbAccess for VAX RMS retrieves the data defini-
 tions for these files from VAX CDD/Plus. RdbAccess for VAX RMS emu-
 lates a relational database by combining the source data and its as-
 sociated definitions.

 RdbAccess for VAX RMS can be used with interactive Rdb/VMS SQL as well
 as with programs using embedded SQL, SQL module language, or dynamic
 SQL. It can also be used in conjunction with products such as VAX Data
 Distributor, DECquery, DECdecision, DEC RALLY, and TEAMDATA.

 Components

 Non-SQL Data Server

 The Non-SQL Data Server is the component that brings data and their
 definitions (metadata) together and makes them appear relational. The
 Non-SQL Data Server enables applications to access this non-relational
 data in a relational manner. The Non-SQL Data Server plans, optimizes,
 and executes read and write operations.

 VAX RMS Driver

                               DIGITAL                 February 1992

                                                         AE-PCL0B-TE

 

 The VAX RMS driver contains the code specific to accessing VAX RMS files
 and IBM MVS data sets. It utilizes RMS indexes in accessing the data
 when appropriate.

 Features

 o  RdbAccess for VAX RMS provides read and write access to local RMS
    files. Transaction support is provided by using RMS Journaling on
    VMS V5.3 and by DECdtm on VMS V5.4 at a minimum. The SQL "reserv-
    ing" option can be used when starting transactions to specify file
    access modes.

 o  RdbAccess for VAX RMS provides read-only access to remote VAX RMS
    files and to certain IBM MVS data sets (including VSAM) via the DEC-
    net/SNA Data Transfer Facility. For more information, refer to the
    DECnet/SNA Data Transfer Facility Software Product Description (SPD
    27.85.xx).

 o  VAX CDD/Plus is used as the source of data definitions (metadata).
    Users either enter the definitions directly into VAX CDD/Plus or
    use existing definitions (for example, definitions created by prod-
    ucts such as VAX DATATRIEVE).

 o  Users can perform relational operations such as joins, selects, sorts,
    and projects. These operations can be done on multiple VAX RMS files,
    or on multiple IBM MVS data sets.

 o  VAX RMS indexed, sequential, and relative files are supported.

 o  VAX RMS record formats (one type per file) are supported as fol-
    lows:

    -  fixed-length: fully supported

    -  variable-length with fixed length control

    -  variable-length:*

    -  stream:*

    -  undefined: not supported

                                  2

 

    *  Support for the fixed portion of each record that is defined in
       VAX CDD/Plus

 o  The CDD/Plus OCCURS clause is supported. By using CDD/Plus FILLER
    field definitions, columns in a table can be hidden from end users.

 o  Using RdbAccess for VAX RMS with VAX Data Distributor, VAX RMS data
    and IBM MVS data sets can be extracted and stored in VAX Rdb/VMS
    relations. For more information, refer to the VAX Data Distribu-
    tor Software Product Description (SPD 27.76.xx).

 o  By means of VAX Rdb/VMS SQL/Services application programming in-
    terface (API), applications (including DECquery) on VMS, ULTRIX,
    OS/2[R], Macintosh[R], and MS-DOS[R] can access VAX RMS files and IBM MVS
    data sets. For more information, refer to the VAX Rdb/VMS Software
    Product Description (SPD 25.59.xx).

 o  VAX RMS files and IBM MVS data can be accessed directly from VAX-
    based third-generation-language (3GL) programs using the VAX Rdb/VMS
    data access sublanguages, embedded SQL, SQL module language, or dy-
    namic SQL. These data access sublanguages are the same sublanguages
    used to access VAX Rdb/VMS data relations and views. The VAX Rdb/VMS
    development option is required to develop 3GL applications that use
    RdbAccess for VAX RMS. VAX Rdb/VMS provides SQL precompiler sup-
    port for languages such as Ada, C, COBOL, FORTRAN, and PL/I. SQL
    module language can be used with any language that supports the VMS
    calling standard. Refer to the VAX Rdb/VMS Software Product Descrip-
    tion (SPD 25.59.xx) for a complete description of programming lan-
    guage support.

 o  When RdbAccess for VAX RMS is used with VAX TEAMDATA or DECdeci-
    sion, end users can access VAX RMS and IBM MVS data directly, join
    it with Rdb/VMS tables, store the results in TEAMDATA or DECdeci-
    sion folders, etc., for use in decision support and other personal
    and departmental applications.
