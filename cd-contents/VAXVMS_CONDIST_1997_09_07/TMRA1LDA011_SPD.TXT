           50.29.01

           DESCRIPTION

           TeamRoute is an electronic document initiation, routing, approval, and
           tracking system. It works between members of an organization distributed
           across wide-area and/or local-area networks. It is designed to accom-
           modate the primary attributes of paper-based document processing sys-
           tems with the added flexibility, security, and efficiency common to
           electronic processing systems. The design considers the diverse and
           ever changing needs of an organization's administrative systems.

           TeamRoute uses the master routing package as the model for gathering,
           disseminating, processing, and presenting information. It allows an
           end user to select a template from a library of templates, create a
           new routing package from that template, specify the routing list, en-
           ter information into applicable fields, attach any relevant informa-
           tion, and route the master routing package and any attachments to users
           or other applications for processing and/or approval/disapproval.

           TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 supports interaction among a heterogeneous group
           of clients and among multiple server domains. TeamRoute for OpenVMS[1]
           supports
           MS[R]-Windows[TM], and Video Terminal clients. Refer to the Software
           Product Description (SPD 41.96.xx) for TeamRoute for OpenVMS. Team-
           Route for ALL-IN-1 supports the TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 client. Use of
           the TeamRoute ALL-IN-1 client requires the ALL-IN-1 Version 2.4 or Ver-
           sion 3.0 product. TeamRoute functionality on the Microsoft[R] Windows
           platform is only available as part of the TeamLinks product set. Re-
           fer to the Software Product Description (SPD 41.17.xx) for TeamLinks

           TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1, Version 1.1/Dansk             SPD 50.29.01


           TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 is accessible as a separate subsystem of the
           ALL-IN-1 V2.4 product. Routing packages are received, filed, and or-
           ganized in a separate inbox within the user's File Cabinet. Users choose
           TeamRoute from the ALL-IN-1 main menu to enter the system. TeamRoute
           shares nicknames with ALL-IN-1.

           TeamRoute allows routing of documents within departmental local-area
           networks, and across wide-area, store-and-forward networks by utiliz-
           ing Digital's ALL-IN-1 Electronic Mail and MAILbus products.

           Features

           API

           A public Application Programmers Interface (API), which allows users
           to create linkages with new and existing applications, is documented
           in the TeamRoute Programming Guide.

           Templates

           Master routing packages are produced from modifiable templates. Mod-
           ifiable templates and routing package ownership allows users to stip-
           ulate routing policies and receipt actions for a master routing pack-
           age.

           Sample Applications

           TeamRoute provides several sample applications in the form of pre-defined
           templates. These sample applications demonstrate the capabilities of
           TeamRoute and can be used by users with or without modifications. These
           sample applications include: Action Item, Document Review, Read and
           Acknowledge, Telephone Call Slip, Account Request, Meeting Notice, Ask
           a Question, and Travel Request.

           Routing Packages

           A routing package is the object that is created by the initiator and
           routed to recipients. It is created by selecting a template and fill-
           ing out the routing list, adding attachments, and signing it. The rout-
           ing package at this point becomes the "Master" and is stored in the

                                            2

 



           TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1, Version 1.1/Dansk             SPD 50.29.01


           initiator's File Cabinet on the server. Routing copies are sent to re-
           cipients who can add attachments or modify the routing list of the mas-
           ter copy. Recipients can save their copies in their own personal File
           Cabinets. The master gets updated throughout the lifecycle of the rout-
           ing package.

           User Roles and Policies

           During the lifecycle of a routing package all participants play one
           or more specified roles. For example, a user may be an approver at one
           step and a carbon copy (cc:) recipient at another step. Roles are as-
           signed by the routing package initiator or template designer. Roles
           are defined by a set of rights (what a user can do), requirements (what
           a user must do), and optionally, the name of an application to invoke.

           Routing Package Tracking

           Tracking can be requested for any routing package stored in a user's
           File Cabinet. When tracking is requested, the Server sends a new car-
           bon copy of the master in its current state.

           A routing package's history is used to monitor its progress. The events
           logged in the routing package history include: when signatures are ap-
           plied, if the application was run, when copies were sent, and when up-
           dates were applied.

           Routing

           Routing is defined by a routing list. The Server sends routing pack-
           ages according to the position of the recipients in the routing list.
           It updates the master when it receives a revised copy from a recip-
           ient, and then sends a new copy to the next recipient on the list.

           The routing list is created by the routing package initiator or the
           template designer. However, the path a routing package takes during
           its lifecycle may differ from the one specified in the original rout-
           ing list because someone along the way may modify it. Serial and carbon-
           copy parallel routing are both available.

           An attachment is any additional file or document that is routed with
           the master routing package. When a file or document is attached, the
           server marks that attachment with the name of the user adding the at-
           tachment, an attachment ID, the date and time of addition, a user-provided
           subject label, attachment, data type, and file name. The date and time
           of addition is the local date and time.

           Signatures

           Signatures is a password-protected function that indicates approval,
           disapproval, or acknowledgment of a routing package. If an attachment
           is subsequently removed or a key field value altered, the signature
           becomes invalid.

           When users sign a routing package, TeamRoute adds their name, the date
           and time, any added remarks, and the approval action. Recipients view-
           ing signatures are shown whether the signature remains valid.

           Help

           Users can get help for TeamRoute by using the Help facility. Help pro-
           vides basic information on how to perform the function in question with-
           out the user having to reference the documentation.

           Printing

           TeamRoute takes advantage of the printing facilities provided by the
           underlying mail system. The user can specify the printer destination
           and options.

           Editing

           TeamRoute allows users to specify their editor of choice supported by
           ALL-IN-1 Electronic Mail.

           System Management

           TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 provides a separate management utility. Invok-
           ing these utilities allows cluster-wide system management operations
           to be managed centrally.

           There are no special utilities to run for File Cabinet maintenance.

           ing standard OpenVMS utilities.

           TeamRoute is designed to support multi-lingual operations. It can be
           deployed in a multi-lingual network and can support multi-lingual op-
           erations on a single server system. For more information, contact your
           local Digital office.
