           character input/output handling, to provide a Korean language user 
           interface, and to offer a Korean language platform for developing 
           Korean DECwindows Motif applications.

           DECwindows Motif/Hangul for OpenVMS V1.2-3 supports Korean data that
           conforms to the KS C 5601-1987 character set standard of Republic of
           Korea. It also supports DEC Hangul & Korean EUC encoding.

           This SPD describes only the internationalized and Korean specific 
           features which are extensions or additions to standard DECwindows

           Locale Switching

           DECwindows Motif/Hangul for OpenVMS V1.2-3 provides a platform for 
           developing locale-independent windowing applications. Applications 
           developed using the technologies of X11R5 and OSF/Motif R1.2.3 
           toolkit can exhibit different local language behavior according to 
           the locale setting.

           DECwindows Motif/Hangul for OpenVMS V1.2-3 is based on the XPG locale
           model. Users can switch the language of an application by specifying
           the locale at startup time. This locale switching mechanism is also
           designed to be interoperable with other DECwindows Motif products, 
           such as DEC OSF/1 and ULTRIX Worksystem Software.

           DECwindows Motif/Hangul for OpenVMS V1.2-3 supports a coexistence of
           different language variants on the same computing system, with the 
           possibility of changing easily from one language to another.

              server.

           2. Off-the-spot - pre-edit data is displayed in a fixed location of
              the application window, usually right under the application win-
              dow.

           3. Over-the-spot - pre-edit data is displayed in a child window of 
              the application which is placed over the current insertion point.

           4. On-the-spot - the input method directs the application through 
              callbacks to display the pre-edit data.
