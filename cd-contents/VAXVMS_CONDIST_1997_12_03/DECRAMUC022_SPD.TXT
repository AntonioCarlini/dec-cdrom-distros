PRODUCT NAME:  DECram for OpenVMS Version 2.2B         SPD 34.26.05

DESCRIPTION

DECram for OpenVMS Version 2.2B supports both the OpenVMS for Alpha
and OpenVMS for VAX platforms.

DECram for OpenVMS is a disk device driver that improves I/O performance
by allowing an OpenVMS system manager to create pseudo disks (RAMdisks),
which reside in main memory. Frequently accessed data can be accessed
much faster from a DECram device than from a physical disk device. These
RAMdisks can be accessed through the file system just as physical disks
are accessed, requiring no change to the application or the system software.

Because main memory is allocated for a DECram device, extra memory is
generally required. The OpenVMS system manager can designate the amount
of memory dedicated to the DECram device(s) and the files that will
be stored on it.

Cluster Environment

DECram for OpenVMS Version 2.2B is fully supported when installed on
any valid and licensed standalone or clustered VAX or Alpha system.
DECram devices can be members of a shadow set, and can be served by
mass storage control protocol (MSCP). There are no special hardware
requirements to install DECram for OpenVMS Version 2.2B.

User Interface

The user interface to a DECram device is the same as other disk class
devices. Note that the response to a SHOW DEVICE /FULL command will
indicate "device type unknown" in current OpenVMS releases. The 
device type DT$_RAM_DISK is not known by the SHOW DEVICE command in
current OpenVMS releases.

Management Interface

A DECram device is managed by the same tools used to manage any other
OpenVMS disk device. For example, the INITIALIZE, MOUNT, and DIRECTORY
commands will work the same on both hard disk and DECram devices.
However, the standard utilities are used differently to set up a DECram
device.

System Analysis

Before creating a DECram device, the OpenVMS system manager must 
determine its size. Each disk block allocated to a DECram device will
mean one less page of available memory. The system manager should also
assess the need for multiple DECram units. See Restrictions listed below.

System Generation

When adding a DECram device, the OpenVMS system manager must reassess
the values for the SYSGEN parameters that control paging and swapping
behavior.

Restrictions

DECram for OpenVMS Version 2.2B currently has the following restrictions:

o  Data in a DECram device is volatile.

o  A single DECram device size is limited to 524,280 blocks.

Note: For disk volumes larger than 524,280 blocks, multiple DECram disk
devices can be created and bound into a volume set.

DECram for OpenVMS is not designed to support long-term data storage.
If a system or hardware failure occurs, data stored in the DECram 
device is lost and must be re-created.

Operating System Software for VAX and Alpha Product Description (SPD 25.01.xx),
