 PRODUCT NAME:  Archive/Backup System                   SPD 48.16.09
                Version 2.1B for OpenVMS

 DESCRIPTION

 Archive/Backup System (ABS) Version 2.1B for OpenVMS is DIGITAL's pri-
 mary OpenVMS archive and backup product. For license options, see the
 section titled LICENSE OPTIONS in this document.

 ABS Version 2.1B provides you with the ability to use two modes of op-
 eration: ABS Full and ABS OMT.

 o  ABS Full-The ABS full mode of operation provides the full function-
    ality of the ABS software for more experienced, advanced users. The
    ABS full mode of operation provides a graphical user interface (GUI)
    that enables you to use the full-functionality of ABS, and it also
    provides the DIGITAL command line interface (DCL).

 o  ABS OMT-The Archive/Backup System for OpenVMS Management Tools (ABS
    OMT) mode of operation provides streamlined backup capability and
    an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) that limits the ABS
    functionality. The ABS OMT mode is the same as that offered in the
    Enterprise Integration Package defined for the NT Affinity Program.

 Note:

 Both modes of operation support NT and UNIX clients.

 ABS Version 2.1B automates backup operations, provides for system archiv-
 ing, and makes it easy to find files stored on tapes and disks. ABS
 also provides client backup facilities, and therefore is a major com-
 ponent in a "lights out" data center environment. ABS expands these
 backup facilities to include support of NT and UNIX clients.

                                                        October 1997

                                                         AE-QHD6K-TE

 

 Features

 ABS provides the following important file archiving and backup capa-
 bilities:

 o  New Motif based GUI under the ABS OMT mode

 o  Full mode GUI for defining archive and backup policies, saving and
    restore data, and for finding data objects and databases that have
    been backed up or archived using ABS.

 o  Automatic, flexible scheduling of backup and archive operations for
    OpenVMS systems and for selected NT and UNIX clients.

 o  Support for OpenVMS client backup and archiving operations directly
    between disks and tape drives located on different systems using
    DECnet[TM] or DECnet-Plus[TM] network protocol.

 o  Digital TCP/IP protocol for supported NT and UNIX Clients.

 o  Online maintenance of information about backed up and archived files,
    disk volumes and databases. This allows for quickly retrieving files
    or restoring disk volumes without the having to know the names of
    the tape volumes on which the data was saved.

 o  Integration with POLYCENTER Scheduler for advanced and complex schedul-
    ing of backup and archive operations.

 o  Easily installed and configured, with an out-of-the-box default con-
    figuration.

 o  Error recovery and reporting capability

 o  Integration with RMU/BACKUP and RMU/RESTORE, allowing backup and
    restore operations of Oracle Rdb[TM] databases

 o  Layers upon a robust and fully tested media manager that provides
    the following important media and device management capabilities:

    -  Effective use of all media capacity by appending multiple save
       sets of backed up or archived files to the same volume or vol-
       ume set

                                  2

 

    -  Direct positioning to the start of each save set file during a
       restore operation using saved information about the tape posi-
       tion of each save set file

    -  Customization features to meet a variety of operational and site
       requirements

    -  Support for unattended backup operations using automatic tape
       cartridge loaders; optional support for the StorageTek[R] au-
       tomated cartridge server

    -  Media life cycle control including maintenance of volume reten-
       tion period, availability status, location, and scheduling dates
       when volumes are to move offsite and return.

    -  Maintenance of counters for each volume noting the number of times
       a volume has been mounted and the number of errors associated
       with the volume. These counters are used to schedule volume clean-
       ing when the counters exceed setable threshold values.

    -  Media allocation control based on customer-defined media pools.

    -  Ability to print external tape labels in a customizable format.

    -  Built-in report generation and custom report generation capa-
       bility.

    -  Security features to prevent unauthorized media or device use.

    -  Round-robin device allocation to distribute drive usage among
       available tape drives.

    -  In an OpenVMS[TM] Cluster environment, automatic failure recov-
       ery from the loss of a processor to allow continuous access to
       the media databases.

 o  Integration with the Remote Device Facility (RDF[TM]).

    The RDF software is included within the media management software.
    RDF allows the media manager to access a tape from other OpenVMS

                                  3

 

    nodes across the DECnet or DECnet-Plus network for ABS backup and
    archive operations.

    RDF makes access to remote tape drives invisible to ABS backup and
    archive operations by issuing commands as appropriate when a des-
    ignated tape drive is considered remote. The media manager also man-
    ages volume load requests to remote systems to allow unattended back-
    ups or to communicate with a console operator. The media manager
    makes no direct use of the remote disk capabilities within RDF.

    RDF includes the following components:

    -  RDF servers that execute tape I/O requests on behalf of a re-
       mote client. Servers are located on systems that have tape drives
       attached or that can access drives through the OpenVMS TMSCP[TM]
       server.

    -  RDF clients that provide the communications interface between
       applications reading or writing data to a tape drive and the RDF
       servers.

 ABS Server for OpenVMS

                                  4

 

 ABS Server for OpenVMS software provides both ABS OMT and ABS full op-
 erational modes, as previously described, to the nodes or OpenVMS Cluster
 on which ABS is executing. A node or OpenVMS Cluster executing ABS server
 software provides backup policy management services for itself and for
 any OpenVMS, NT, and UNIX client nodes connected to it. At least one
 ABS server license is required in the network. Two are recommended to
 ensure failover capabilities.

 ABS server software manages the catalogs that record information about
 user files backed up or archived under ABS control at the local node.

 ABS Client for OpenVMS

 ABS Client for OpenVMS software provides backup and archiving oper-
 ations for the OpenVMS node or OpenVMS Cluster on which it is execut-
 ing, and it acts as a client of another node executing ABS server soft-
 ware when it requires policy information.

 NT and UNIX Client

 An NT or UNIX Client license allows backup scheduling and archiving
 services for the NT or UNIX client node configured within the ABS soft-
 ware environment.

 ABS ACS for OpenVMS

 ABS ACS for OpenVMS supports the StorageTek 4400 automated cartridge
 server. This license is required in order to interface the StorageTek
 ACS to ABS for OpenVMS software.

 The ABS ACS for OpenVMS license is loaded in the system together with
 either the ABS server or ABS client licenses.

 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

 ABS runs on the VAX and Alpha processors supported by OpenVMS. For a
 detailed list of the VAX and Alpha processors supported by OpenVMS,
 see the OpenVMS VAX and Alpha Operation System Software Product De-
 scription (SPD 25.01.xx).

 OpenVMS Disk Space Required for Media Database and Catalogs

 The media manager database should be placed only on nodes executing
 ABS for OpenVMS Server software.

 The disk space required by the ABS for OpenVMS media database depends
 on the number of pieces of media to be managed. During installation,
 the storage administrator may designate the disk on which the media
 manager database is to be kept. For enhanced data safety, the media
 manager database may be stored on a shadowed disk.

 ABS catalog files are present on any OpenVMS node executing either ABS
 server software or ABS client software. The disk space required by ABS
 catalogs depends on the number of files to be tracked by the ABS soft-
 ware.

 OpenVMS Disk Space Required for the ABS Server Software

 Executing the ABS server software requires approximately 50,000 blocks,
 plus one block for every piece of media it manages. Each instance of
 saving a file requires less space in the catalog. For example, the first
 five times a file is saved, it requires approximately .73 blocks per
 file. If the file is save 20 times, it requires approximately .45 blocks
 per file.

                                  7

 

 Disk Space Required for the ABS Client and ABS ACS Software

 Execution of ABS client software requires approximately 20,000 blocks.
 Each instance of saving a file requires less space in the catalog. For
 example, the first five times a file is saved, it requires approxi-
 mately .73 blocks per file. If the file is save 20 times, it requires
 approximately .45 blocks per file.

 All of the disk space requirements previously specified are in ref-
 erence to the system disk. The sizes are approximate; actual sizes may
 vary depending on the user's system environment, configuration, and
 software options.

 Disk Space Required for the ABS NT or UNIX Client Software

 ABS NT and UNIX Client software is included in the ABS Server for Open-
 VMS software. Only the proper UNIX or NT Client License Packs are needed
 to enable the software.

 DEVICE SUPPORT

 The following libraries and loaders have been tested and qualified by
 Storage Management Software Engineering and they are supported by the
 Storage Management Software products using the common media manager
 (SLS, ABS, HSM and SMF). However, Storage Management Software Engi-
 neering does not test each of the devices with every possible combi-
 nation of controllers and host systems. Because the Storage Manage-
 ment Software products and the Media Robot Utility (MRU) run in com-
 mon environments, these combinations are tested first with MRU. Upon
 successful completion of the MRU tests, the storage management prod-
 ucts are then tested in representative configurations. Note that MRU
 is not a prerequisite for the Storage Management Software products.

 Therefore, to determine if your specific configuration is supported,
 follow these steps:

 1. If you have a tape drive that is not software-defined as a juke-
    box (is not a library or a loader device), reference the OpenVMS
    Software Product Description (SPD 25.01) to determine if your tape
    drive is supported for your platform and controller/adapter com-
    bination.

 2. If your device is software-defined as a jukebox (it is a library
    or loader device), first check the following list to determine if
    it is supported by the media manager. If the device is supported,
    see the following instructions:

    a. Check the OpenVMS Software Product Description (SPD 25.01) to
       make sure the tape drive(s) in your library/loader are supported
       for your platform and controller/adapter combination.

    b. Check the MRU Software Product Description (SPD 64.44) to make
       sure your library/loader is supported by MRU for your specific
       controller/adapter combination.

 3. Assuming your device is correctly connected and configured, it is
    fully supported by the common media manager and its clients.


                                 14

 

 If you have devices that are not shown on the list, they may still be
 supported. DIGITAL continually tests its software on additional de-
 vices that may have been released since the last publication of this
 SPD. If you have a question about a particular device, contact DIG-
 ITAL customer support.
