         PRODUCT NAME: Digital SNA 3270 Application Services,   SPD 38.70.05
                       Version 1.2

         DESCRIPTION

         The Digital SNA 3270 Application Services layered software product
         is a member of the Digital SNA Programming Access Routines family
         of products. This family of layered software products consists of
         a variety of programming access routines that enable communications
         between IBM and Digital applications.

         The Digital SNA 3270 Application Services software provides a library
         of callable routines and other components for building OpenVMS
         and Digital UNIX applications that support processing of IBM 3270
         data streams. When used with the Digital SNA Domain Gateway, these
         3270 data stream applications can be accessed from SNA networked 3270
         block mode terminal and PC users. Refer to the Digital SNA Domain
         Gateway Software Product Description (SPD 38.69.xx) for more 
         information.

         The Digital SNA 3270 Application Services software provides the 
         following components:

         o  An application programming interface (API) for developing 3270
            data stream applications

         o  An OpenVMS print symbiont for printing ASCII files on SNA-attached
            LU Type 1 or Type 3 printers and non-SNA-attached LU Type 0 
            printers (OpenVMS only)

         o  DECforms (V1.4) support for building forms-oriented applications
            for 3270 terminals (OpenVMS only)

         o  A mechanism for testing applications without an SNA network


                                                                July 1996

                                                              AE-PN5QF-TE

         Version 1.2

         Application Programming Interface

         The 3270 Application Services API provides a library of routines for
         developing 3270 data stream applications. These applications can be
         SNA LU Type 1, 2, or 3 applications or non-SNA LU Type 0 applications.
         They can serve as the primary logical unit (PLU) and activate
         a session with the remote 3270 device as the secondary logical
         unit (SLU) in the SNA network.

         The API is callable from any OpenVMS language conforming to the 
         OpenVMS calling standard on OpenVMS systems, and from the C language 
         on Digital UNIX systems.

         The application that calls the Digital SNA 3270 Application Services
         API is responsible for generating and interpreting all 3270 data 
         streams. The API provides the following features:

         o  Receives incoming LU Type 0, 1, 2, and 3 connections

         o  Initiates outgoing LU Type 0, 1, 2, and 3 connections

         o  Establishes and terminates sessions

         o  Transmits and receives data

         o  Implements the protocols for chaining, bracketing, responses, and
            session and data flow control

         o  On Digital UNIX, the API is Pthreads safe

         o  Supports TCP/IP and DECnet on Digital UNIX and OpenVMS

         The API provides integrated block mode access and VT emulation. In
         this way, applications written to use the API can also be run 
         interactively by 3270 users while running MEP VT. See the Optional 
         Products section of this SPD for a description of the MEP VT product.

         Print Symbiont (OpenVMS only)

         The 3270 Application Services software provides a 3270 OpenVMS print
         symbiont for printing local ASCII files on an SNA-attached LU Type
         1 or Type 3 printer or a non-SNA-attached LU Type 0 printer from an
         OpenVMS print queue.

         The 3270 OpenVMS print symbiont allows system managers to initiate
         and start OpenVMS print queues. Users can print files on SNA-attached
         printers. The following features are available for OpenVMS users:

         o  Burst, flag, and trailer pages

         o  Print form specification

                                        2

         Version 1.2

         o  Automatic session establishment, retry on error

         o  LU Type 1 printer console commands

         o  DCL queue management commands

         Other features of the print symbiont include:

         o  Prints all types of sequential RMS files, including FORTRAN and
            Print file types, except for non-PRN VFC files.

         o  Data can be sent to the printer untranslated and unformatted. This
            is useful if the printer is an ASCII printer attached to the SNA
            network. This is supported for LU Type 1 printers only.

         o  Symbiont can either pass through escape sequences or strip them
            out.

         o  Translation can be controlled on a queue-by-queue basis. In this
            way, sites that need to use multiple translation tables are 
            accommodated.

         o  Certain IBM applications keep the printers bound unless they get
            a NOTIFY indication in the C(D)INIT. Connections are now queued
            until the application unbinds.

         o  The symbiont uses the FORM qualifier to set the size of the 
            margins. Text that goes beyond those margins is truncated.

         DECforms for 3270 Terminals (OpenVMS only)

         Digital SNA 3270 Application Services provides support for the 
         DECforms (V1.4) product to enable the development of forms-oriented 
         applications that can be accessed by SNA networked 3270 terminal and 
         PC users. These DECforms applications can be developed without 
         knowledge of 3270 Data Stream, SNA, or the Digital SNA Application 
         Services software. DECforms is Digital's implementation of the 
         ANSI/ISO standard for a Form Interface Management System (FIMS). 
         Refer to the DECforms Software Product Description (SPD 29.90.xx) for 
         additional information.

         Application Testing Tools

         The Digital SNA Domain Gateway is required for 3270 access; however,
         a 3270 Terminal Emulator provides a method for preliminary testing
         of incoming sessions by emulating the SLU side of a session. For 
         example, testing can be done with the DECnet/SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator
         for OpenVMS (SPD 26.84.xx) or the DECwindows DECnet/SNA 3270 Terminal
         Emulator for OpenVMS (SPD 31.58.xx).

         The Digital SNA 3270 Application Services SNALOG trace utility 
         provides debugging facilities to debug applications layered on Digital
         SNA 3270 Application Services.

         Thread Safe

         Under Digital UNIX, the interface is fully thread safe and can be
         used by a multithreaded program.

         OPTIONAL PRODUCTS

         MEP VT for Digital SNA 3270 Application Services (OpenVMS VAX only)

         The INTEGRATA MEP VT is an OpenVMS terminal emulation software package
         that allows 3270 users to access unmodified applications on OpenVMS
         systems. MEP VT provides full-screen access to OpenVMS applications,
         including ALL-IN-1, existing OpenVMS based customer applications,
         and utilities such as OpenVMS Mail.

         In addition, the 3270 user can run 3270-ready API applications in
         block mode from the MEP VT. This provides the benefits of block mode
         access while accessing the program through a VT emulation terminal
         session.

         MEP VT for Digital SNA 3270 Application Services is a worldwide Digital
         Distributed and Supported (DDS) product from INTEGRATA, AG, Tubingen
         Germany. Refer to SPD 44.00.xx for additional information.
