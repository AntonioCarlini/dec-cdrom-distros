PRODUCT NAME:  DIGITAL Optical Storage Desktop         SPD 47.45.06
	        Software (OSDS) for OpenVMS VAX and Alpha, 
                Version 3.4a

DESCRIPTION

The DIGITAL[TM] Optical Storage Desktop Software (DIGITAL OSDS) for
OpenVMS[TM] product provides OpenVMS applications and users the func-
tionality necessary to access a standalone, multifunction optical drive
or drives using the conventional device, file, and record access ser-
vices provided by the OpenVMS Operating System. In most cases, no changes
will be required to existing applications that use magnetic disk stor-
age.

The OpenVMS VAX[TM] and OpenVMS Alpha versions of DIGITAL OSDS pro-
vide local or VMScluster[TM] access to rewritable or WORM (Write Once,
Read Many) media containing FILES-11 on-disk structure using the RWZ5x
series of optical drives. DIGITAL OSDS for OpenVMS VAX also provides
support for WORM media containing the WORMS-11[R] on-disk structure
using the RWZ5x optical drives. DIGITAL OSDS for OpenVMS Alpha does
not support any configuration using WORM media containing the WORMS-11
on-disk structure.

Pseudo-Device Representation

DIGITAL OSDS allows the OpenVMS host to view the media inserted into
the optical disk as a virtual disk device. For single-headed drives,
this translates to one virtual disk device for each optical disk sur-
face. The optical drive, therefore, appears to applications as a vir-
tual disk device, or pseudo-device. Excluding those functions that are
unique to the optical technology, the pseudo-device emulates the op-
eration of a conventional OpenVMS magnetic disk.

                                                          July 1997

 

Volume Access

Volumes in an optical drive used with DIGITAL OSDS are accessed us-
ing the same techniques that are used to access conventional OpenVMS
disks. The standard OpenVMS INITIALIZE command is used to prepare each
side of an optical disk media for use and the standard OpenVMS MOUNT
command is used to make the volume known to OpenVMS. WORM volumes can
be "initialized" only once, whereas rewritable volumes, like magnetic
disks, can be "initialized" many times.

File Access

Files on volumes under control of DIGITAL OSDS are accessed using the
same techniques that are used to access conventional OpenVMS files.
Once a volume has been mounted, files can be opened, read, written,
and closed using the conventional OpenVMS system services and run-time
library functions. WORM volumes can use the FILES-11 or WORMS-11 file
system. Rewritable volumes use the FILES-11 file system.

DIGITAL OSDS provides essentially transparent access using standard
OpenVMS commands and I/O statements from application programs. DIG-
ITAL OSDS supports all OpenVMS commands and their library routine equiv-
alents, such as, but not limited to:

ALLOCATE           DEALLOCATE      MOUNT
APPEND             DELETE[2]       OPEN
BACKUP[1]          DIFFERENCE      PURGE
CLOSE              DIRECTORY       READ
COPY               DISMOUNT        RENAME
CREATE             EDIT            WRITE
CREATE             INITIALIZE[3]
/DIRECTORY
___________________________________________________________________
[1]Not all backup options are supported using WORM media.

[2]This command can be used with WORM media but will not free up
additional disk space as with rewritable media.
[3]This command can be used only once with WORM media.

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

The person planning a system configuration must understand the hard-
ware requirements of the complete system. Due to the variety of pro-
cessors that support OpenVMS and the length of time that some Open-
VMS systems have been in service, there exist a huge combination of
processor, SCSI adapter/controller, and optical subsystem combinations.
Some combinations are not supported.

These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. Ad-
ditional disk space might be required based on the user's system en-
vironment and configuration, as well as the user options selected at
installation time.

The minimum memory supported is 16 Mbytes for VAX systems and 32 Mbytes
for Alpha systems. The use of this software in conjunction with in-
creased memory capability improves performance. The memory size sug-
gested for most typical VAX hardware configurations is at least 32 Mbytes.
