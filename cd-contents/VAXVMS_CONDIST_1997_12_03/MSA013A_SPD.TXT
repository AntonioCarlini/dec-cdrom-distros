PRODUCT NAME:  PATHWORKS V1.3A for OpenVMS (Macintosh)  SPD 35.09.05

DESCRIPTION

PATHWORKS[TM] V1.3A for OpenVMS[TM] (Macintosh[R]) is a member of the
PATHWORKS family of software products that provides Macintosh network-
ing and network operating system (NOS) integration in local and wide
area networks. PATHWORKS integrates PCs, Macintosh servers, NOSs, net-
work transports, and protocols and provides the foundation for client-
server applications and corporate information exchanges.
PATHWORKS provides a framework for integrating personal computers into
an organization's total information system, so that different types
of users can share information, large system resources, and network
services across the entire organization.

PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Macintosh) allows Alpha and VAX[TM] computers
running the OpenVMS operating system to offer file, print, and mail
services to Macintosh clients. By using an Alpha or a VAX server sys-
tem, Macintosh users can share applications, data, printers, and re-
sources; access information from remote systems on the network; and
apply that information in Macintosh applications.

PATHWORKS for Macintosh software allows Macintosh clients to access
file, print, and mail services on OpenVMS. This software also includes
applications for terminal emulation, X display services, TCP/IP util-
ities, DECnet[TM], and mail. PATHWORKS for Macintosh is used with PATH-
WORKS for OpenVMS (Macintosh) and is required for Macintosh client ac-
cess to these OpenVMS based services (SPD 31.53.xx).

                                                           May 1997

Features

PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Macintosh) provides the following features and
capabilities:

o  DECshare file services

o  DECshare print services

o  Server management and control

o  PATHWORKS Mail Server

o  AppleTalk[R] for OpenVMS

o  AppleTalk-to-DECnet Transport Gateway

Server Software

PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Macintosh) provides the Macintosh user with the
following features of the server software:

o  DECshare File Services - The Macintosh user is provided with ac-
   cess to remote OpenVMS file systems as a transparent extension of
   the client's local disk facilities. Macintosh files are stored on
   the Alpha and VAX systems and accessed as if they were stored on
   the user's local disk. DECshare file services are based on the Ap-
   pleTalk for OpenVMS V3.2 network transport and are compliant with
   the Apple[R] Filing Protocol (AFP) V2.1.

DECshare file services assign the Macintosh type and creator attributes
to files that were not created on a Macintosh. The creator and type
determine the icon that is displayed on the Macintosh desktop. When
a Macintosh user selects a file that was not created using the Mac-
intosh, DECshare file services uses a lookup table to assign a type
and creator based on the file's extension. This table may be modified
to tailor the server to site-specific needs.

Each Macintosh file stored on the file server is stored as an Open-
VMS file in RMS Sequential file format. These Macintosh files are ac-
cessible to OpenVMS users and applications that can interpret the con-
tent and organization of a file written by a Macintosh application.

                                 2

 

The file server can read all RMS file types that can be read sequen-
tially, allowing Macintosh applications to read files written by an
OpenVMS application. Each read issued by the Macintosh application re-
sults in the presentation to the application of the next n bytes con-
tained sequentially in the file.

AFP byte-range locking is supported for Macintosh applications access-
ing files provided through the file service.

System administrators can create file services that appear in any one
of the local AppleTalk zones, which provides flexibility in your en-
vironment. System administrators can also limit the number of connec-
tions to a file server volume and set a timeout value for inactive con-
nections to a file server. The file server can detect unauthorized in-
trusions using the OpenVMS Intrusion database.

o  DECshare Print Services - Remote printers appear to the Macintosh
   user as a transparent extension of the client's local facilities.
   Macintosh users can access OpenVMS print queues to print to both
   Apple LaserWriter[R] and DIGITAL PostScript[R] printers. The Ap-
   ple LaserWriter can be accessible to OpenVMS users via a LocalTalk[R]-
   to-Ethernet router, a direct Ethernet connection (for those Laser-
   Writer printers that support this), a terminal server (LAT) port,
   or a direct connection to a serial port on the server system.

The system administrator assigns a service name to the print queue.
The Macintosh users select the printer from the Chooser as they do lo-
cal printers. Then the printer I/O is directed to the defined and se-
lected DECshare print service.

DECshare print services include support for the DECshare Receiver, which
handles print requests from the Macintosh. The Receiver stores the PostScript
data it receives from the Macintosh in a temporary OpenVMS file be-
fore sending the data to the OpenVMS print queuing system. System ad-
ministrators can choose to disable the Receiver so that Macintosh users
cannot print to a specific LaserWriter. System administrators can also
hide a LaserWriter from the Chooser, so that users who want to print
to a specific printer are required to print through the DECshare print
service.

                                 3

 

DECshare print services also support the DECshare print symbiont, which
transfers data from Alpha and VAX systems to an Apple LaserWriter printer.
The DECshare print symbiont also converts an ASCII file submitted by
an OpenVMS user to PostScript data before transferring the data to the
printer. The symbiont does not support full ANSI conversion. DECshare
uses the DECprint[R] Printing Services to transfer data to a DIGITAL
PostScript printer.

The MSA$MANAGER utility is used to create print services. Print queues
for DIGITAL's printers must be previously defined on the OpenVMS sys-
tem. LaserWriter queues using the DECshare print symbiont are created
by the MSA$MANAGER utility.

o  Server Management and Control - When a server offers a file resource
   for use, the system administrator can associate an Access Control
   List, which specifies privileges assigned to users.

While the software may be running on more than one node of a VMSclus-
ter[TM], each Macintosh volume served can only be served from a sin-
gle file server in the cluster. As a result, there is no cluster failover
of a served volume.

An administrator's utility (MSA$MANAGER) is provided to allow the sys-
tem administrator to add and remove services and show resources. The
system administrator can also manage a remote server using the SET RE-
MOTE command.

A second administrator's utility (ATK$MANAGER) is provided to allow
the system administrator to set up and maintain AppleTalk for Open-
VMS and the AppleTalk-to-DECnet transport gateway.










                                 4

 

o  PATHWORKS Mail Server - The mail server included in PATHWORKS for
   OpenVMS (Macintosh) provides Macintosh and PC clients with the abil-
   ity to send and receive electronic mail messages. A mail account
   must be established on the OpenVMS server for each client, unless
   an account already exists. Mail can be sent to this account by other
   Macintosh clients as well as users of any mail system that can com-
   municate with OpenVMS mail software. The mail server then routes
   messages to the appropriate client when the client logs in to the
   server.

The PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Macintosh) mail server provides the Mac-
intosh user with folders, distribution lists, and delivery capabil-
ities. Notification of new messages occurs when the Macintosh user logs
in to a network session and the PATHWORKS Listener is running on the
client.

Network Connectivity

o  Appletalk for OpenVMS - AppleTalk for OpenVMS V3.2 is an implemen-
   tation of Apple's AppleTalk Networking protocols and interface li-
   braries for OpenVMS systems. AppleTalk for OpenVMS allows an Open-
   VMS system to communicate with an AppleTalk network. The DECshare
   file and print services use this network transport. The AppleTalk
   for OpenVMS protocol stack includes support for the following pro-
   tocols: ADSP, AELAP, AARP, AEP, NBP, ZIP, RTMP (full set), ATP, ASP
   (server only), and PAP (client and server). The ASP client and the
   AFP protocols are not implemented in the AppleTalk for OpenVMS pro-
   tocol stack.

AppleTalk for OpenVMS V3.2 supports AppleTalk Phase 2 protocols. Only
Macintosh computers connected to Phase 2 networks can access services
using AppleTalk for OpenVMS.

AppleTalk for OpenVMS also allows routing, or tunneling, through DEC-
net. When tunneling, AppleTalk packets are encapsulated in DECnet pack-
ets, so that the AppleTalk network can be extended, and Macintosh users
can access remote AppleTalk networks and servers as if they were lo-
cal.


                                 5

 

The router provides AppleTalk Internet routing, zone management, rout-
ing table maintenance, and name-binding broadcast request handling.
When routing, or tunneling, datalink speeds below 56 kilobits/second
are not recommended and speeds below 19.2 kilobits/second are not sup-
ported. The datalink speed must be capable of handling DECnet and Ap-
pleTalk traffic (including all protocol overhead) without congestion.
That is, there must be sufficient bandwidth to maintain reliable com-
munications.

o  AppleTalk-to-DECnet Transport Gateway - AppleTalk-to-DECnet Trans-
   port Gateway, which is OpenVMS software, connects a Macintosh with
   a DECnet service on any DECnet node. As a result, Macintosh users
   who have only AppleTalk connectivity, but no DECnet resident soft-
   ware, can participate in task-to-task applications. Macintosh ap-
   plications that are written to take advantage of the AppleTalk-to-
   DECnet gateway can participate in AppleTalk-to-DECnet task-to-task
   communications. The gateway provides bidirectional conversion be-
   tween AppleTalk ADSP and DECnet NSP protocols. The gateway supports
   up to 1000 connections from client applications - provided that suf-
   ficient system CPU and memory resources are available. Significant
   system tuning will be necessary if the number of sessions is raised
   appreciably from the default of 32.

Restrictions and Limitations

Because PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Macintosh) uses AppleTalk Phase 2 pro-
tocols, services provided by PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Macintosh) servers
will only be accessible to Macintoshes that are connected to Phase 2
networks. Phase 1 networks can coexist with Phase 2 networks, provided
that Phase 1 to Phase 2 transition router is suitably placed somewhere
in the network. Use of Phase 1 protocols anywhere in the network is
not recommended due to the increased network load.

While AFP byte range locking is supported among Macintosh clients, only
file locking is supported with other types of clients (MS-DOS[R] and
OS/2[R]).

For a serially connected LaserWriter, the following characters in font
families are not available: Ctrl-C, Ctrl-D, Ctrl-Q, Ctrl-S, Ctrl-T.
These characters are used by the PostScript interpreter for handshak-
ing purposes. Attempts to print these characters result in a space char-
acter. This restriction does not apply to AppleTalk printers directly
connected on Ethernet or LocalTalk.

The PATHWORKS mail server restricts folder names to 39 characters. If
a user creates a folder name with more than 39 characters, the name
is truncated after the 39th character.

The DECshare implementation of AFP V2.1 does not support Blank Access
Privileges or the AFP Cat Search functions.

PATHWORKS for Macintosh Client Software

PATHWORKS for Macintosh V1.3A (SPD 31.53.xx) is recommended for best
compatibility and performance on the latest Macintosh computers. PATH-
WORKS for Macintosh V1.2 or later is required to take advantage of spe-
cial DECshare server notification messages via the PATHWORKS Listener.

OpenVMS Tailoring

For OpenVMS V5.x systems, the following OpenVMS classes are required
for full functionality:

o  OpenVMS Required Saveset

o  Network Support

o  System Programming

o  Secure User's Environment

For more information on OpenVMS classes and tailoring, refer to the
OpenVMS VAX Operating System Software Product Description (SPD 25.01.xx).

For printers listed in the Optional DIGITAL Hardware section of this
SPD, appropriate supporting software (such as DECprint Printing Ser-
vices V4.1, SPD 32.41.xx) is required.

AppleTalk tunneling and the AppleTalk-to-DECnet gateway require DEC-
net or DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS VAX V5.5. For DECnet/OSI support, the
OpenVMS node must have a Phase IV compatible name in the back trans-
lation table.

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Macintosh) has been tested on a number of sup-
ported configurations. If a customer problem with PATHWORKS for Open-
VMS (Macintosh) is reproduced by the customer on one of these supported
configurations, DIGITAL will work the problem to resolution on these
supported configurations. If the customer problem cannot be reproduced
by the customer on one of these supported configurations, it is the
responsibility of the customer to resolve the issue.

To be supported by PATHWORKS for Macintosh, a Macintosh computer must
have either built-in (on-board) Ethernet, or a Nubus Ethernet adap-
tor card. The computer must have at least 2 MB of physical memory free
(in addition to the memory consumed by the operating system and con-
currently running application programs). The computer must also have
at least 15 MB of disk space available for a complete installation.
Typical installations (such as the default installation, which does
not include MacX) consume approximately 5 MB of disk space.

PATHWORKS supports all Alpha and VAX systems, components, and periph-
erals supported by the versions of OpenVMS listed as supported in the
OpenVMS SPDs for Alpha and VAX systems.

Processors not supported:

o  MicroVAX[TM] I, MicroVAX II, MicroVAX 2000

o  VAXstation[TM] I, VAXstation II, VAXstation 2000, VAXstation 8000

o  VAX-11/725, VAX-11/730, VAX 11/782

Other Hardware Requirements

The Alpha or VAX system must be connected to the same AppleTalk In-
ternet or DECnet network as the Macintosh client.

A minimum of 1 MB of available memory is required to install and run
the server process. Depending on client print and file service work-
load, up to 1 MB of additional memory should be allocated for every
five Macintosh clients. Ten percent of total memory should be left free.
