PRODUCT NAME:  DEC Pascal for OpenVMS                  SPD 25.11.42

This SPD describes two products:

o  DEC Pascal Version 5.5 for OpenVMS Alpha Systems

o  DEC Pascal Version 5.5 for OpenVMS VAX Systems

DESCRIPTION

DEC Pascal is an implementation of the Pascal[*] language that accepts
programs compatible with either level of the ISO specification for Pro-
gramming languages - Pascal [ISO 7185-1987] as well as ANSI/IEEE 770X3.97-1987.
DEC Pascal also meets the Federal Information Processing Standard Pub-
lication (FIPS-109) requirements by accepting programs conforming to
the ANSI standard. DEC Pascal also accepts many features from the Ex-
tended Pascal standard (ANSI/IEEE 770X3.160-1989) and ISO 10206.

The compiler has been validated for both levels of the ISO unextended
Pascal standard and for conforming to FIPS-109. Containing extensions
to the standards, DEC Pascal generates optimized, shareable code that
takes full advantage of the VAX and Alpha hardware floating point and
character instruction sets and the virtual memory capabilities of the
OpenVMS VAX or OpenVMS Alpha Operating Systems. The language contains
control statements, data types, and predeclared procedures and func-
tions.

Major Pascal Language Elements:

o  INTEGER, REAL, CHAR, BOOLEAN, enumerated, and subrange data types

o  ARRAY, RECORD, SET, and FILE structured data types

o  Schemata type denoting families of types

o  STRING schema denoting variable-length character strings up to 65,535
   characters

o  FOR, REPEAT, and WHILE repetitive control statements

o  CASE, IF-THEN, and IF-THEN-ELSE conditional statements

o  BEGIN...END compound statement

o  User-defined procedures and functions that can return structured
   types (other than file types)

o  GET, PUT, READ, WRITE, READLN, and WRITELN input and output pro-
   cedures

o  Concatenation operator and set of predefined character string func-
   tions including INDEX, LENGTH, and SUBSTR

o  Standard set of functions, procedures, and operators

o  Module initialization and finalization

o  Initial state specification

o  Enhanced structured value constructors

o  Implementation characteristics (MAXCHAR, MINREAL, MAXREAL, EPSREAL)

o  OTHERWISE clause and case ranges for CASE statement and variant records

o  Date and Time functions and procedures

o  Short Circuit Boolean Operators (AND_THEN and OR_ELSE)

o  Non-Decimal representation of numbers

o  Exponentiation operator (**)

Pascal Extensions:

o  DOUBLE (VAX D_floating, VAX G_floating, IEEE T_floating) data type
   that supports the Alpha double range and double precision float-
   ing point architectureal features

                                 2

 

o  QUADRUPLE (VAX H_floating on OpenVMS VAX and IEEE X_floating on Open-
   VMS Alpha) data type that supports the Alpha extended range and ex-
   tended precision floating point architectural features

o  Support for null-terminated strings via the C_STR_T predefined type
   and the MALLOC_C_STR, C_STR, PAS_STRCPY, and PAS_STR predefined func-
   tions (OpenVMS Alpha only)

o  VARYING data type denoting variable-length character strings up to
   65,535 characters

o  Language elements providing sequential and random access to RMS rel-
   ative files, and sequential and keyed access to RMS multikey in-
   dexed files

o  Optional attributes specification on constants, variables, types,
   type identifiers, routines, routine parameters, schema discrimi-
   nants, and compilation units

o  MODULE capability for combining procedures, functions, and other
   declarations for compilation separate from the main program

o  ENVIRONMENT and INHERIT attributes to control separate and inde-
   pendent compilation

o  UNSIGNED, CARDINAL, INTEGER_ADDRESS, INTEGERnn, UNSIGNEDnn, POINTER,
   and SINGLE predefined types

o  VALUE initialization section and optional value initialization in
   declaration section program level

o  External procedure and function declarations

o  Nonpositional passing of parameters

o  RETURN, BREAK, CONTINUE, EXIT, and NEXT statements

o  Default values for parameters

o  Double-quoted character strings with backslash constants

o  31-character identifiers that can include dollar sign ($) and un-
   derscore (_)

                                 3

 

As a native-mode language, DEC Pascal is integrated into the Common
Language Environment. This integration provides DEC Pascal users with:

o  Support for OpenVMS interlanguage calling standard

o  Access to all OpenVMS system services

o  Access to the facilities of the OpenVMS Symbolic Debugger

o  Callable interfaces to the OpenVMS Common Run-time Library

o  Oracle CDD/Repository support

o  Support for the Language-Sensitive Editor/Source Code Analyzer to
   provide error diagnostics to Language-Sensitive Editor component,
   cross reference information for Source Code Analyzer component, and
   support for low-level program design, including the processing of
   pseudocode. In addition, DEC Pascal for OpenVMS VAX Systems also
   supports the extraction of design information from comments.

o  Ability for functions to return structured types (other than file
   types)

Options available to Pascal users at compile time include:

o  Run-time checks for array, character string, and subrange bounds

o  Run-time checks for arithmetic overflow, valid case selector val-
   ues, and null pointer variables

o  Run-time checks for invalid declarations and illegal GOTO usage

o  Generation of information for use by the OpenVMS Symbolic Debug-
   ger and the run-time error traceback mechanism

o  Creation of an environment file facilitating separate compilation

o  Cross-reference listing

o  Creating in the listing file a representation of the object code
   generated by the compiler

o  Printing of information-level messages including flagging uses of
   extensions to the ISO and ANSI Pascal standards

                                 4
