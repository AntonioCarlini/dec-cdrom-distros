 DESCRIPTION

 DECwindows Motif/Hanzi for OpenVMS V1.2-3 is the simplified Chinese
 version of DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS V1.2-3. When used in conjunc-
 tion with OpenVMS/Hanzi, it extends the standard DECwindows Motif for
 OpenVMS V1.2-3 to provide internationalized windowing services for us-
 ing and developing internationalized DECwindows applications. It also
 extends the local language capabilities to support Chinese character
 input/output handling, to provide a Chinese language user interface,
 and to offer a Chinese language platform for developing Chinese 
 DECwindows Motif applications.

 DECwindows Motif/Hanzi for OpenVMS V1.2-3 supports Chinese data that
 conforms to the GB2312-80 character set standard of People's Republic
 of China. It also supports DEC Hanzi encoding.

 This SPD describes only the internationalized and Chinese specific fea-
 tures which are extensions or additions to standard DECwindows Motif
 for OpenVMS. For a description of the base functionalities of DECwindows
 Motif for OpenVMS, please refer to Software Product Description
 (SPD 42.19.01).

 INTERNATIONALIZATION FEATURES

 Locale Switching

 DECwindows Motif/Hanzi for OpenVMS V1.2-3 provides a platform for 
 developing locale-independent windowing applications. Applications 
 developed using the technologies of X11R5 and OSF/Motif R1.2.3 toolkit
 can exhibit different local language behavior according to the locale
 setting.

 DECwindows Motif/Hanzi for OpenVMS V1.2-3 is based on the XPG locale
 model. Users can switch the language of an application by specifying
 the locale at startup time. This locale switching mechanism is also
 designed to be interoperable with other DECwindows Motif products, such
 as DEC OSF/1 and ULTRIX Worksystem Software.

 DECwindows Motif/Hanzi for OpenVMS V1.2-3 supports a coexistence of
 different language variants on the same computing system, with the 
 possibility of changing easily from one language to another.
