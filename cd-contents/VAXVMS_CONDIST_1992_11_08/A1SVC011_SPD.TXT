 PRODUCT NAME:  ALL-IN-1 DESKtop Server for VMS,        SPD 31.71.01
                Version 1.1

 DESCRIPTION

 ALL-IN-1 DESKtop Server for VMS[*] is an ALL-IN-1 layered application
 that runs on a suitably-configured VMS host computer. It controls the
 exchange of inbound and outbound mailbags between ALL-IN-1 DESKtop users
 and ALL-IN-1. A mailbag is a single file comprised of one or more elec-
 tronic mail messages and, optionally, their attachments as well as their
 associated envelope header information. The product also recognizes
 and executes Message Based Applications (MBAs) and File Transfer re-
 quests. The Server converts different document types using ALL-IN-1's
 conversion mechanism, the CDA Converter Library, or a third party prod-
 uct called KEYpak[R] (if installed).

 ALL-IN-1 DESKtop Server for VMS supports ALL-IN-1 DESKtop for DOS, Ver-
 sion 1.0, Version 1.1 and ALL-IN-1 DESKtop for Macintosh[R], Version 1.0.

 Note: For the purpose of this Software Product Description, IBM[R] com-
 patible personal computers and Macintosh computers will be referred
 to as DESKtop.

 The ALL-IN-1 DESKtop product family includes:

 o  ALL-IN-1 DESKtop for DOS (SPD 50.20.xx) - Software supporting DOS
    microcomputers that integrates into the services provided by ALL-IN-1.

 o  ALL-IN-1 DESKtop for Macintosh (SPD 55.25.xx) - Software support-
    ing Macintosh computers that integrates with the services provided
    by ALL-IN-1.

 Features

 Mail Sorting and Routing

 ALL-IN-1 DESKtop Server for VMS monitors the DESKtop user's inbound
 mail area for the appearance of new mail and alerts the DESKtop user
 of the availability of the mailbag (if the mailbag watch is active).
 The DESKtop user activates the server, by means of a menu selection
 on the DESKtop computer, to carry out a mail exchange (send/receive).
 This mail exchange is accomplished using the appropriate transfer pro-
 tocols available for connecting the PC, Macintosh and VAX.

 Note: KERMIT is included in this product.

 During mail exchange, proper safeguards are maintained to avoid col-
 lisions with the mail reading/writing process. The server can keep a
 log of all Mailbag exchanges.

 The minimum required connection time for a mail exchange is the amount
 of time required to move the available mailbags to and from the PC or
 Macintosh Computer.

 Reading/Writing Mail

 All mail is stored and forwarded through ALL-IN-1. For each registered
 user, the ALL-IN-1 DESKtop Server for VMS reads inbound mail from the
 ALL-IN-1 INBOX and writes outbound mail to the ALL-IN-1 CREATE BOX.

 The write process of outbound mail starts with an un-bagging and sort-
 ing operation. Messages can be ALL-IN-1 mail messages or messages des-
 tined for Message Based Applications (MBAs). The write process also
 interprets all mailbag information pertaining to priority, read re-
 ceipt, addressees, subject and so forth, and creates an appropriate
 ALL-IN-1 message. Addressees are checked for acceptability; any ad-
 dressee not acceptable is not used and a rejection message is returned
 to the personal computer.

 During the read process, the body file and attachments are inspected
 to determine their ability to be converted. Conversion of an attach-
 ment's format is determined by the DESKtop recipient's preferred for-
 mat. Document conversions make use of ALL-IN-1's conversion mechanism,
 the CDA Converter Library, or KEYpak (if installed). Read messages are
 collected with messages from other sources (such as Message Based Ap-
 plications MBAs) into a new or existing mailbag and held until the next
 mailbag exchange is initiated.

 Scheduling

 The Scheduler is a detached process which manages an in-memory, queued
 list of activities for the user. It continuously cycles through its
 queued list of users, searching for new requests to dispatch to one
 of the following servers:

 ALL-IN-1 Message Server - a detached process which continuously runs
 an ALL-IN-1 session from within a privileged account. An inbound mail
 request causes the Scheduler to dispatch a 'bagging' request to the
 Message Server. Similarly, an outbound mail request causes the Sched-
 uler to dispatch an 'unbagging' request to the Message Server.

 MBA Server - a detached process which processes a given Message Based
 Application upon signal from the Scheduler.

 File Transfer Server - a detached process which completes a file trans-
 fer request dispatched by the Scheduler.

 System Management

 System Management is accomplished by means of a menu driven interface
 for the creation and maintenance of user profile lists, network, and
 printer validation lists. The system manager can broadcast messages
 to the DESKtop user base, startup and shutdown the scheduler and the
 three task servers, and do installation testing. This management func-
 tion runs from either the VMS system manager's or the ALL-IN-1 man-
 ager's account.
