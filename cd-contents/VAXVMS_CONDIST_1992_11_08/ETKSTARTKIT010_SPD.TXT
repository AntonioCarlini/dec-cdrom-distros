 PRODUCT NAME:  DECexpress Starterkit for VAX/VMS,      SPD 35.18.00
                Version 1.0

 DESCRIPTION

 EXPRESS is the first internationally standardized formal language for
 information modeling as defined by the International Standards Orga-
 nization (ISO 10303-11). EXPRESS information modeling has its origins
 modeling product data information, however it is applicable to most
 database or information applications.

 EXPRESS Language Features

 o  Formal Language

    The EXPRESS language is intended to support rigorous specification
    of data. Schemas written in EXPRESS can be processed or compiled
    directly.

 o  Object-Oriented

    The EXPRESS language can be applied to structured object-oriented
    data modeling.

 o  Enables Application Integration

    EXPRESS enables application integrations based upon common, imple-
    mentation independent data models.

 o  Relationship to STEP

    STEP is the standardization effort underway at ISO (Technical Com-
    mittee 184, Sub-Committee 4) to standardize the exchange of prod-
    uct definition data. STEP is an abbreviation for the Standard for
    the Exchange of Product definition data, often referred to as the
    PDES standard. EXPRESS was developed within the STEP project and
    is used to specify the requirements of the other parts of ISO 10303,

    however, EXPRESS is being applied to general information modeling
    applications outside of the STEP domain.

 o  The Information Model

    In EXPRESS, a schema provides the basis for information partition-
    ing and inter-communication. The main objects of a schema are en-
    tities and constraints. Entities are defined in terms of attributes.

 EXPRESS provides language elements for information objects to be de-
 fined simply, uniquely, and unambiguously with the constraint on the
 data clearly and concisely stated. The EXPRESS language is not a pro-
 gramming language, therefore, it does not contain language elements
 which allow input/output, information programming, or exception han-
 dling.

 DECexpress is Digital Equipment Corporation's program to implement EXPRESS-
 based tools of similar or like functionality, targeted to several host
 systems.

 DECexpress Starterkit Features

 DECexpress Starterkit contains the following components:

 o  DECexpress Text Editing Tool, which is a VAX Language Sensitive Ed-
    itor (LSE) template tailored to the EXPRESS language

 o  DECexpress Parser, an EXPRESS information modeling language syn-
    tax verifier

 In conjunction with the VAX Language-Sensitive Editor/Source Code An-
 alyzer, (VAX LSE/SCA) the DECexpress Text Editing Tool will assist EXPRESS
 modelers in debugging their EXPRESS language syntax on the basis of
 list and diagnostic files produced by the DECexpress Parser.

 For more information on the LSE/SCA, refer to the VAX Language-Sensitive
 Editor/Source Code Analyzer Software Product Description (SPD 26.59.xx)
 or the DECset for ULTRIX Software Product Description (SPD 33.86.xx).

 The DECexpress Parser contained in the Starterkit performs EXPRESS syn-
 tax checking on an input text file of EXPRESS code; no "object" or "ex-
 ecutable" code is produced.

                                  2

 

 The DECexpress Parser checks the EXPRESS syntax for one or more in-
 dependent information schemas contained in an input file. The Parser
 provides the following functions

 o  syntax checking

 o  reference checking

 o  type checking

 These functions are consistent with the grammar rules of the ISO spec-
 ification, ISO TC184/SC4/WG5 N14.

 The DECexpress Parser additionally provides reference checking for the
 following object types:

 o  entities

 o  functions

 o  procedures

 o  schemas

 o  types

 Type checking is also performed for the following types:

 o  attributes

 o  constants

 o  functions

 o  parameters

 o  type labels

 o  variables

 The following reports can be generated to provide the user with in-
 formation for review purposes:

 o  diagnostic file

 o  list file

 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

 Processors and/or hardware configurations as specified in the System
 Support Addendum (SSA 35.18.00-x).

 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

 For Systems Using Terminals: (No DECwindows interface):

 o  VMS Operating System

 o  VAXset for VMS

    VAX LSE/SCA is included in VAXset for VMS

 For Workstations Running VWS:

 o  VMS Operating System

 o  VMS Workstation Software

 o  VAXset for VMS

    VAX LSE/SCA is included in VAXset for VMS

 For Workstations Running DECwindows:

 o  VMS Operating System (and necessary components of VMS DECwindows)

 o  VAXset for VMS

    VAX LSE/SCA is included in VAXset for VMS

 If the required VAX LSE is not installed on the system at edit-time,
 the DECexpress Text Editing Tool functionality will not be available.
 Such functionality includes the debugging aides provided by the VAX
 LSE/SCA by parsing (compiling) within the VAX LSE/SCA.

 The DECexpress Parser will be able to perform standalone EXPRESS pars-
 ing functions, as described, even if the VAX LSE/SCA is not installed
 on the system.

 Refer to the System Support Addendum (SSA 36.09.02-x) for availabil-
 ity and required versions of prerequisite/optional software and for
 information regarding components of VMS DECwindows.
