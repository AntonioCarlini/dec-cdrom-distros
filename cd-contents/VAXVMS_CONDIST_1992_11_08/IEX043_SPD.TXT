 PRODUCT NAME:  IEX-VMS-DRIVER, Version 4.3             SPD 26.30.09

 DESCRIPTION

 IEX-VMS-DRIVER allows programs written in VAX MACRO and higher-level
 languages (such as VAX FORTRAN, VAX BASIC, and VAX Pascal) to commu-
 nicate through the IEU11-A or IEQ11-A with devices containing an IEC
 625-1 or IEEE Standard 488 interface. This communication is implemented
 through a choice of direct QIO calls or a set of subroutines callable
 from high-level languages.

 Note: In the following description, the term IEX11 stands for the IEU11-
 A and/or IEQ11-A interface. The IEU11-A supports VAX UNIBUS machines,
 and the IEQ11-A supports MicroVAX Q-bus machines.

 The IEX11-A interface is a bit-parallel, byte-serial device that can
 perform transfers in either program interrupt or DMA (direct memory
 access) mode. Program interrupt is used for transferring commands and
 addresses, while DMA is used for transferring data. DMA significantly
 reduces processor loading during the transfer of long data buffers.

 The IEX11-A interface contains two independent IEC/
 IEEE bus controllers, also known as General Purpose Interface Buses
 (GPIBs). These two controllers may be connected to the same or to dif-
 ferent IEC/IEEE buses. Up to 15 devices may be attached to each IEC
 /IEEE bus.

 The IEX11 is most commonly used as Controller-in-Charge, but it can
 also be used when another device is Controller-in-Charge. The Controller-
 in-Charge directs the sequence of information on the bus.

 When the IEX11 acts as Controller-in-Charge, it may request status in-
 formation from other devices through serial and parallel polling. When
 the IEX11 is not Controller-in-Charge, it can be polled in either fash-
 ion to provide status information.

 Features

 The IEX-VMS-DRIVER supports the following IEC/IEEE hardware capabil-
 ities:

 o  Controller (C1, C2, C3, C4, C5)

 o  Talker and Extended Talker (T5, TE5)

 o  Listener and Extended Listener (L3, LE3)

 o  Automatic Source Handshake (SH1)

 o  Automatic Acceptor Handshake (AH1)

 o  Service Request (SR1)

 o  Remote/Local (RL1)

 o  Parallel Poll (PP1, PP2)

 o  Device Clear (DC1)

 o  Device Trigger (DT1)

 The IEX-VMS-DRIVER supports QIO requests to perform the following soft-
 ware functions:

 o  Initialize Unit

 o  Write Data

 o  Read Data

 o  Send One IEC/IEEE Bus Command*

 o  Send a String of IEC/IEEE Bus Commands*

 o  Request Service**

 o  Issue a Serial Poll*

                                  2

 

 o  Configure Devices for Parallel Polls*

 o  Load Parallel Poll Register**

 o  Perform a Parallel Poll*

 o  Go to Controller-Active-State (CACS)*

 o  Go to Controller-Standby-State (CSBS)*

 o  Pass Control*

 o  Sense Mode

 o  Set Mode

 o  Enable Event Recognition

 o  Recognize Events

 The event recognition facility allows the user's process to specify
 the events on the IEC/IEEE instrument bus which the interface should
 detect. The interface is capable of detecting the occurrence of the
 following events:

 o  Service Request*

 o  Addressed as Listener**

 o  Addressed as Talker**

 o  Deaddressed**

 o  Addressed as Extended Listener**

 o  Addressed as Extended Talker**

 o  Device Clear**

 o  Device Trigger**

 o  Remote/Local Change**

 o  Parallel Poll Configure**

 o  Parallel Poll Unconfigure**

                                  3

 

 o  Interface Clear

 *  Functions that can only be used by the Controller-in-Charge

 ** Functions used only by a device that is not Controller-in-Charge

 All IEC/IEEE bus commands are issued through a process request and all
 data is transferred through the DMA mechanism. When the IEX-VMS-DRIVER
 is processing a read data request, the three ways to detect the end
 of the data transfer are:

 o  Byte Count Overflow - Transfer terminates after the specified num-
    ber of bytes have been read.

 o  EOI Termination - Transfer terminates if, during the reception of
    a byte, the EOI line is true.


 o  Match Character - Transfer terminates after the Termination spec-
    ified match character has been consecutively received the speci-
    fied number of times.

 A device exerciser is provided to verify that the IEX-VMS-DRIVER is
 correctly installed and to aid the user in testing his application.
 When the two bus controllers are connected with a loop back cable (re-
 fer to the IEU11-A/IEQ11-A User's Guide), the device exerciser can be
 run with command files delivered with the exerciser. These command files
 demonstrate all features of the driver and the IEC/IEEE bus interface
 functions. The device exerciser can also be used by users in a dia-
 logue mode to test their devices. The commands to the exerciser are
 directly converted into QIOs to the driver. Using the exerciser in the
 dialogue mode, users can quickly determine the set of QIOs required
 for their application.

 The IEX-VMS-DRIVER may be programmed in the following two ways:





                                  4

 

 VMS QIO System Service - The VMS QIO requests allow direct access to
 the driver. These requests can be issued in higher-level languages (such
 as VAX FORTRAN, VAX BASIC, VAX Pascal, and MACRO-32). This is the most
 flexible way of programming the IEX11 device, but requires the user
 to be familiar with the QIO calling procedures.

 Simplified User Interface - This is a package of subroutines which can
 be called from higher-level languages (such as VAX FORTRAN and VAX BASIC)
 to perform the following functions:

 

 IESTRT -  Initialize an interface

 IEPOLL -  Setup for serial polling

 IESEND -  Send data

 IERECV -  Receive data

 IERQSV -  Request service

 IECMD -   Perform a bus control function

 IEWFE -   Wait for IEC/IEEE bus event
