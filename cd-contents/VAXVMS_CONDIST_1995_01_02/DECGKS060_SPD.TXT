 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC GKS for OpenVMS, Version 6.0        SPD 26.20.14

 DESCRIPTION

 DEC GKS (Graphical Kernel System) for OpenVMS VAX is a three-dimensional
 graphics support system that provides the application programmer with
 a set of functions for interactive and non-interactive computer graph-
 ics applications that define and display computer-generated three-dimensional
 pictures using a variety of computer graphics equipment. DEC GKS for
 OpenVMS VAX, as a development tool, is a solid base for portable, device-
 independent, two-dimensional and three-dimensional graphics applica-
 tion development.

 DEC GKS for OpenVMS VAX implements the International Standard ISO 8805,
 the Graphical Kernel System for Three Dimensions (GKS-3D). DEC GKS for
 OpenVMS VAX conforms to level 2c of ISO 8805. Thus, it provides full
 output capabilities including workstation independent segment stor-
 age [level 2], and full input capabilities (synchronous and asynchronous
 input [level c]).

 DEC GKS for OpenVMS VAX is device independent. That is, the same pro-
 gram can generate graphical output on different devices without mod-
 ification to the source code. DEC GKS for OpenVMS VAX supports DECwin-
 dows Motif[R] for OpenVMS VAX. DEC GKS for OpenVMS VAX also supports
 output in PostScript[R], DDIF (Digital's Document Interchange Format),
 and CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) formats. Numerous other graph-
 ics devices are supported, as outlined in the OPTIONAL HARDWARE sec-
 tion of this SPD.

 DEC GKS for OpenVMS VAX is a subroutine library packaged as a set of
 shareable images against which the application program is linked. The
 shareable images are activated at run-time as needed.

 For customers familiar with previous releases of DEC GKS or DEC GKS-3D
 on other platforms, DEC GKS for OpenVMS VAX systems is the merger of
 two products: DEC GKS-3D Version 1.2 and DEC GKS Version 4.2.

 Features

 Viewing Operations

 DEC GKS for OpenVMS allows the user to specify views of three-dimensional
 objects and define the working coordinate system (world coordinates).
 World coordinates can have any scale. For example, one application might
 have a maximum range from 0 to 1000.0 while another application might
 limit the range from 0.01 to 0.1.

 The user can also control multiple simultaneous views of the same ob-
 ject on separate display surfaces, as well as the position of the pic-
 ture on the surface. For example, one application program can display
 an image of a cube in one window on a workstation and at the same time,
 in another window (on another workstation if required), it can dis-
 play a detail of the rear of the cube.

 GKS-3D Metafile

 DEC GKS for OpenVMS provides an interface to sequential files: the ISO
 (8805) suggested GKS-3D Metafile and the ISO (7942) suggested (2-D)
 GKSM Metafile. Both reading (interpreting) and writing are supported
 on both metafile types. The metafiles can be used for the following
 purposes:

 o  Storing graphical information in a device-independent format

 o  Transporting graphical information between systems with compati-
    ble versions of GKS

 o  Transporting graphical information from one DEC GKS application to
    another

 o  Transporting graphical information from a DEC GKS-3D application
    to a DEC GKS application

                                  2

 

 o  Storing accompanying nongraphical information

 CGM Output

 DEC GKS for OpenVMS VAX provides support for storing information us-
 ing the CGM. CGM is an approved ANSI standard format (ANSI X3.122-1986).
 DEC GKS for OpenVMS supports CGM output for the following formats:

    Clear Text Encoding - Graphical output data stored in the clear text
    format is easily created, viewed, and modified using a common text
    editor. It is also a suitable format for transferring graphical out-
    put data through networks that only support the transfer of a text
    file.

    Character Encoding - Graphical output data is typically stored in
    the character format for minimal file size. Data stored in this for-
    mat is particularly suitable for transfer through networks that can-
    not support binary transfers.

    Binary Encoding - Graphical output data stored in binary format is
    very compact and the fastest to read and write. However, it is the
    least suitable for transmission over communications lines as all
    8 bits in each byte are meaningful.

 DDIF Output

 DEC GKS for OpenVMS provides support for storing two-dimensional views
 of three-dimensional objects encoded in DDIF. Views stored in DDIF can
 be processed by applications that conform to Digital's Compound Doc-
 ument Architecture.

 Window Systems

 DEC GKS for OpenVMS provides support for DECwindows and DECwindows Mo-
 tif.

 Escape Feature



                                  3

 

 DEC GKS for OpenVMS provides an escape mechanism that allows the ap-
 plication programmer to access device capabilities not defined in the
 GKS standard.

 Multiple Character Sets

 DEC GKS for OpenVMS provides a series of device-independent, stroke-
 precision character fonts. These character fonts were originally dig-
 itized by Dr. Allen V. Hershey of the Naval Surface Weapons Labora-
 tory and supplied to Digital by the National Bureau of Standards.

 DEC GKS for OpenVMS also provides text support for the native char-
 acter set(s) of the supported graphical devices.

 In DEC GKS for OpenVMS, text lies on a plane that may be arbitrarily
 positioned in three-dimensional space. Language Bindings

 DEC GKS for OpenVMS functions can be accessed by four sets of subrou-
 tine calls:

 o  An interface that conforms to the ISO (DIS 8806/1) FORTRAN bind-
    ing to GKS-3D.
    The FORTRAN binding interface allows users to port GKS applications
    that are written in FORTRAN across heterogeneous operating systems
    with conforming implementations of the FORTRAN binding and GKS-3D.

 o  An interface that conforms to a three-dimensional extension of the
    ISO (DP 8651/4) C language binding to GKS.

 o  Language-independent three-dimensional binding, which follows the
    standard OpenVMS calling conventions and is callable by many dif-
    ferent languages.

 o  Language-independent two-dimensional binding, which follows the stan-
    dard OpenVMS calling conventions and is callable by many differ-
    ent languages.

 Graphic Handlers

 DEC GKS for OpenVMS AXP provides support for a wide variety of Dig-
 ital and non-Digital graphics devices. Refer to the OPTIONAL HARDWARE
 section for more detail.

 Output Functions

 Segments  DEC GKS for OpenVMS provides a set of functions for the
           creation, manipulation, and deletion of stored groups of
           output primitives called segments.

 Immediate It is not mandatory to use segments. DEC GKS for OpenVMS
 Mode      provides a way of immediately outputting graphic primi-
           tives to the device(s), which can be useful in certain
           applications.

 Polyline  Draws one or more connected line segments between points
           defined in three-dimensional space by an arbitrary se-
           quence of three-dimensional coordinates.

 Polymarker Draws one or more symbols that mark significant points
           in a picture in a position defined by arbitrary three-
           dimensional coordinates.

 Text      Draws any character string on a plane arbitrarily placed
           within three-dimensional space; characters can be dis-
           played in a variety of fonts and orientations.


















                                  5

 


 Fill      Draws a polygonal area on a plane arbitrarily placed
 Area      in three-dimensional space; this area can be hollow
           or filled with a uniform color, a pattern, or a hatch
           style.

 Fill      Draws a set of polygonal areas, which can be hollow or
 Area Set  filled with a uniform color, a pattern or a hatch style;
           edge control is provided.

 Cell      Draws a rectangular image, specified by a two-dimensional
 Array     array of picture elements, on a plane arbitrarily placed
           in three-dimensional space.

 GeneralizedAllows access to drawing capabilities of graphics de-
 Drawing   vices that are not used by the functions listed above;
 Prim-     circles and arcs are examples of two GDPs commonly used.

 Attributes

 Each output function has an associated set of "attributes" that con-
 trol the appearance of the output. Attributes can be defined in groups
 (called bundles) or individually. Examples of attributes for polyline
 are:

 Line      The programmer can control the style of a line. For
 Type      example, lines can be dotted or dashed.

 Line      In addition to line type, the width and scale of the
 Width     line in three dimensions can be controlled.








                                  6

 


 Color     Color selection is performed by selecting one of the
           predefined colors or by specifying the red, green, and
           blue intensities required to define a particular color
           on color devices.

 Input Functions

 DEC GKS for OpenVMS supports synchronous and asynchronous input us-
 ing any of the following input methods:

 Locator   Returns a point within the user's world coordinate sys-
           tem

 Stroke    Returns a series of points within the user's world coor-
           dinate system

 Valuator  Returns a single real value within a specified range

 Choice    Returns a status and a single non-negative integer
           within a specified range

 String    Returns a string of characters
 Pick      Returns a status and a segment name and pick identifier
           (primitives outside segments cannot be picked)

 Control Functions

 DEC GKS for OpenVMS provides control functions for managing the man-
 ner and devices on which pictures will be displayed. These include GKS
 initialization and termination, and functions that control the open-
 ing and closing of logical graphical devices.

 Inquiry Functions

 DEC GKS for OpenVMS provides a complete set of inquiry functions that
 aid in developing modular device-independent programs.

 DEC GKS for OpenVMS Run-Time Only Option

                                  7

 

 Since DEC GKS is a graphic application development tool, Digital pro-
 vides a Run-Time Only Option for running graphics applications that
 were developed using DEC GKS. This option is offered at a substantially
 reduced cost per CPU. The DEC GKS Run-Time Only Option does not al-
 low the user to create new applications, but rather allows execution
 of applications that were previously developed using the DEC GKS De-
 velopment Option.

 Processor Restrictions

 A TK50 tape drive is required for standalone MicroVAX 2000 and VAXs-
 tation 2000 systems. Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1)

 Development Option:

 Disk space required for    45,000 blocks
 installation:
                            (22.5 MB)

 Disk space required for    44,000 blocks
 use (permanent):
                            (22 MB)

 DEC GKS Run-Time Only:

                                 10

 


 Disk space required for    25,000 blocks
 installation:
                            (12.5 MB)

 Disk space required for    24,000 blocks
 use (permanent):
                            (12 MB)

 These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
 sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
 system environment, configuration, and software options.

 Memory Requirements for DECwindows and DECwindows Motif Support

 The minimum supported memory for this application running in a stan-
 dalone DECwindows environment with both the client and server execut-
 ing on that same system is 8 MB.

 The performance and memory usage of DECwindows applications are par-
 ticularly sensitive to system configuration. Less memory may be re-
 quired on the client system (the system where the software is installed
 and executed) if the server (the component that displays the appli-
 cation) resides on another system. More memory may be required on a
 system with several applications running or where it may be desirable
 to improve the performance of an application.

 The minimum supported memory is the minimum that will allow the prod-
 uct to run adequately. For optimal performance of the product, the rec-
 ommended memory is 8 MB.
