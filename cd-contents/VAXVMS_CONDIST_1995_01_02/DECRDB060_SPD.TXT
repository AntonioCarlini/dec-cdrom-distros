 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC Rdb Version 6.0 for OpenVMS VAX     SPD 25.59.18
                Relational Database Management System

 DESCRIPTION

 DEC Rdb for OpenVMS VAX (DEC Rdb) is a full-function, SQL-based re-
 lational database management system designed for the OpenVMS operat-
 ing system. It is intended for general purpose, multi-user, central-
 ized, or distributed applications and includes database administra-
 tion utilities and support for host-based and client/server program-
 ming. DEC Rdb is available on both OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS AXP sys-
 tems.

 SQL Language Support

 DEC Rdb provides the application developer with a robust, standards-
 based implementation of SQL for both Data Definition Language (DDL)
 and Data Manipulation Language (DML).

 Data Definition Language

 Users can issue DDL statements through the interactive SQL utilities,
 the SQL precompilers, or the SQL module language in order to accom-
 plish the following:

 o  Create schemas (database), tables (relations), views, columns (fields),
    domains (global fields), and indexes (both ascending and descend-
    ing)

 o  Create storage areas for tables and indexes

 o  Create storage areas on write-once, read-many (WORM) optical disks

 o  Define constraints in table definitions

                               DIGITAL                    March 1994

                                                         AE-PWVPC-TE

 

 o  Define triggers for table definitions

 o  Grant and revoke access rights to schemas, tables, views, and columns

 o  Alter definitions of tables, columns, storage areas, and access rights

 o  Delete definitions of tables, views, columns, indexes, constraints,
    triggers, storage areas, and access rights

 o  Extend SQL functions to include user-defined functions written in
    3GL languages.

 o  Restructure schemas on line, without unloading and reloading the
    database

 o  Add comments to definitions of domains, tables, views, columns, and
    indexes

 o  Define collating sequences for international character sets

 o  Enable or disable journal fast commit transaction processing

 o  Use multi-octet character sets for both data and identifiers

 o  Specify string length and offsets in terms of characters rather than
    octets

 Data Manipulation Language

 Users can issue DML statements through all interactive, precompiler,
 and module language interfaces to accomplish the following:

 o  Perform standard data manipulation operations: insert, select, up-
    date, and delete

 o  Perform standard relational operations: select, join, union, and
    project

 o  Perform date-time operations in SQL: cast,
    current_date, current_time, current_timestamp, and extract

 o  Access multiple databases in the same program

 o  Perform atomic transactions completed by commit or rollback on a
    single database or across multiple databases and applications

                                  2

 

 o  Reduce the number of exchanges between application programs and the
    database system through the use of multistatement procedures in SQL
    module language

 o  Use scrollable list cursors to fetch specific segments of multi-
    media objects represented as LIST OF BYTE VARYING datatypes

 o  Direct SQL run-time errors to customized error handling routines

 SQL Programming Interfaces

 DEC Rdb supports all standard SQL application programming interfaces
 including interactive SQL, embedded SQL, SQL module language, and dy-
 namic SQL. Integration with Digital's distributed repository, CDD/Repository,
 is optional.

 Interactive SQL Environment

 The interactive SQL environment provides interactive, SQL-based ac-
 cess to DEC Rdb databases. Support for this environment includes a com-
 mand buffer that allows editing of previous SQL requests, online help
 and a SQL SHOW facility to display information about the database and
 session. All executable DEC Rdb SQL statements, excluding those spe-
 cific to the other SQL interfaces, such as PREPARE and RELEASE state-
 ments, are available.

 Dynamic SQL Programming

 The dynamic SQL interface compiles and executes SQL requests passed
 through its call interface. This programming approach is highly ef-
 fective in applications such as ad-hoc query where the exact param-
 eters of requests are not known until runtime. It is compatible with
 all programming languages that support the OpenVMS calling standard.
 The dynamic memory handling capabilities of DEC Ada, DEC PL/I and and
 VAX C enable these languages to take full advantage of the power and
 flexibility of this approach.

 Embedded SQL Programming


                                  3

 

 The Full Development Option of DEC Rdb includes SQL precompilers for
 DEC Ada, VAX C, VAX COBOL, DEC Fortran, DEC Pascal and DEC PL/I These
 precompilers allow SQL language statements to be embedded directly in
 the host language program. The precompiler for the host language com-
 piles the SQL statements and uses the host language compiler to cre-
 ate object modules which can then be linked as executable images.

 These precompilers support an optional Federal Information Process-
 ing Standards (FIPS) flagger, allowing the user to identify any SQL
 statements which are not in the current ANSI/ISO SQL standard. An ex-
 ception flagger for the Multivendor Integration Architecture (MIA) stan-
 dard is also provided.

 SQL Module Language Support

 SQL module language and the SQL module processor allow SQL statements
 and multistatement procedures to be grouped into modules and compiled.
 These compiled object modules can be linked with objects created by
 language compilers to create executable objects for database appli-
 cations or they can be maintained in the database as a set of stored
 procedures.

 Client applications invoke stored procedures through the SQL CALL state-
 ment. Access to stored procedures is controlled through the use of Ac-
 cess Control Lists (ACLs).

 Multistatement procedure syntax includes SQL DML statements, SQL trans-
 action control statements and flow-control statements.

 The SQL module language compiler supports FIPS and MIA flagging.

 Data Dictionary Support

 DEC Rdb includes a data dictionary that stores definitions of database
 objects such as attributes, fields, indexes in system defined tables
 within the database. These definitions can be read or modified through
 the SQL DDL language interface.



                                  4

 

 The optional use of CDD/Repository with DEC Rdb is recommended because
 it encourages consolidated maintenance of data definitions in a repos-
 itory where they can be shared by all applications, databases and pro-
 gramming tools that use them. Specifically the use of CDD/Repository
 with DEC Rdb allows users to:

 -  Define fields and relations in the database based on dictionary def-
    initions

 -  Share standard definitions among several databases

 -  Analyze the impact of changing shared definitions

 Other Programming Interfaces

 In addition to the standard SQL interfaces, DEC Rdb supports client
 /server implementations with the SQL/Services facility, the DEC ODBC
 Driver for MS[R] Windows and the SQL Multimedia API.

 SQL/Services Support

 SQL/Services is a client/server system that provides client applica-
 tions running on MS[R] Windows[TM], MS-DOS[R], Macintosh[R], Sun[R],
 OpenVMS, and
 ULTRIX platforms with read/write access to DEC Rdb databases and data
 managers supported by DEC DB Integrator (DBI) and the DBI family of
 gateways. These gateways exist for ORACLE[R], SYBASE[R], and DB2[TM]
 VMS RMS files and VSAM data sets. Several desktop applications such
 as Paradox[R] and dBase IV[R], offer SQL/Services compatibility.

 DEC Rdb includes SQL/Services client application programming libraries
 for supported platforms.
 SQL/Services client applications on OpenVMS can be written in any lan-
 guage that supports the OpenVMS calling standard. MS-DOS and MS Win-
 dows client applications should be written in Microsoft[R] C. Macin-
 tosh client applications can be written in MPW[TM] C or ThinkC.

 SQL Multimedia Support


                                  5

 

 The SQL Multimedia software library provided with DEC Rdb simplifies
 the development of distributed, client/server multimedia applications.
 Using SQL/Services, this library provides calls to exchange multime-
 dia objects between the database server and client applications run-
 ning on MS Windows, MS-DOS, Macintosh, ULTRIX/RISC and OpenVMS plat-
 forms. Client applications should be written in Microsoft C, Macin-
 tosh client applications can be written in MPW C or ThinkC.

 The SQL Multimedia library allows the application programmer to de-
 fine multimedia object classes including COMPOUND DOCUMENT, TEXT, TA-
 BLE, IMAGE, VOICE, VIDEO and BLOB and user-definable object formats.
 Image compression/decompression is available through DECimage Appli-
 cation Services.

 Microsoft ODBC Support

 Microsoft Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) applications can read from,
 and write to, DEC Rdb databases using the DEC ODBC Driver for MS Win-
 dows. This driver provides access to SQL/Services servers over DEC-
 net, TCP/IP and Novell[R] NetWare[R] network transports. This driver
 also provides these applications with access to data managers supported
 by DEC DB Integrator (DBI) and the DBI gateways.

 Support for RDO and RDML Programming Interfaces

 DEC Rdb continues to support the RDO Utility, callable RDO and the RDML
 precompilers. These interfaces provide capabilities similar to their
 SQL counterparts although they lack some features of the SQL inter-
 faces.

 Data Management Features

 At runtime, the database engine maximizes concurrent data access while
 enforcing data integrity and data security rules. Some of the features
 that contribute to concurrency, data integrity, security and perfor-
 mance are:




                                  6

 

 Concurrency Controls

 o  Full concurrent access (storage, retrieval, update, and deletion)
    in a multi-user environment

 o  Multiple applications can access the same database concurrently

 o  Optional read-only (snapshot) mode prevents read-only transactions
    from blocking other transactions

 o  Support for SERIALIZABLE, REPEATABLE READ or READ COMMITTED lev-
    els of transaction isolation

 Integrity Controls

 o  Validity checking at the column level

 o  Declaritive referential integrity rules enforced at execution time

 o  Rollback of failed transactions, both automatic and program-controlled

 o  Recovery-unit journaling with transaction rollback recovery

 o  After-image journaling with rollforward recovery

 o  Transparent, SQL-based, Two Phase Commit protocol allows single trans-
    actions to span multiple, distributed DEC Rdb databases

 o  DECdtm services allows single transactions to span distributed DEC
    Rdb databases, DEC DBMS databases and DECtp applications

 o  Triggers enforce the execution of one or more actions when certain
    database conditions are met

 Security

 o  Database file protected by OpenVMS file protection

 o  Rights to perform database operations are kept in a set of Access
    Control Lists (ACLs) associated with entities in the database. ACLs
    are stored in the database and maintained by the owner of the database.
    ACLs can be updated at any time.

 o  Access Control Lists govern access to:

    -  Tables

                                  7

 

    -  Views

    -  Data definitions

    -  Data manipulation operations

    -  Database utility operations

 o  Logging facility to log all database access requests

 Dynamic Query Optimization

 DEC Rdb optimizes query execution through the use of both static and
 dynamic query optimization. At compile time the static optimizer eval-
 uates query requests to determine the most efficient execution strate-
 gies. This evaluation is based on a mathematical prediction of exe-
 cution cost based on estimates of table and index cardinalities, data
 distribution, and the effects that the selection clauses will have on
 the number of records returned.

 If there are multiple ways to access the data, a dynamic optimizer con-
 tinuously evaluates the execution cost of the selected strategy against
 that of alternative strategies. When the estimated cost of an alter-
 native strategy falls below that of the executing strategy the dynamic
 optimizer switches to that alternative strategy.

 Remote Database Access

 Applications running on OpenVMS VAX or OpenVMS AXP systems are able
 to read from and write to:

 -  DEC Rdb databases on either OpenVMS VAX or OpenVMS AXP nodes in a
    common network

 -  IBM DB2, SYBASE and ORACLE databases through DEC DBI gateways run-
    ning on OpenVMS nodes in a common network.

 SQL/Services and DEC ODBC Driver for MS Windows provide desktop clients
 with remote access to DEC Rdb and DBI gateways on both OpenVMS VAX and
 OpenVMS AXP nodes via DECnet, TCP/IP and IPX/SPX network transports.

                                  8

 

 Database Administration Support

 The Rdb Management Utility (RMU) supports the administration of DEC
 Rdb databases with functions for backing up and restoring databases,
 analyzing database contents and structures, and monitoring user ac-
 tivity and resource allocation.

 o  Logical import/export, for migrating data and/or metadata to an-
    other Rdb database

 o  Online backup/restore, both incremental and full at the database
    or storage area level

 o  Database verify feature to check and verify integrity of data struc-
    tures in the database

 o  Analysis feature for analyzing database page usage, space usage by
    tables, and space usage and number of levels of indexes

 o  Statistical feature for performance monitoring and database dump
    utility for database analysis

 o  Load/unload feature which can operate on each table

 o  Global Buffering feature for definition and control of Global Buffers

 o  CHECKPOINT command to force all attached processes to flush mod-
    ified buffers to disk

 o  ALTER feature for modifying the contents of corrupted database stor-
    age areas (this function is not recommended or required for nor-
    mal use)

 Other Database Parameters

 Physical Storage Characteristics

 o  A physical database consists of a single storage area (single file)
    or multiple storage areas (multi-file). Storage areas are placed
    on disk volumes or multi-disk volume sets.

                                  9

 

 o  Storage areas extend dynamically to accommodate actual storage re-
    quirements. Storage areas may use write-once, read-many (WORM) me-
    dia and may be defined as read-only.

 o  Non-blocking read consistency for read-only transactions is sup-
    ported through the optional use of snapshot files. When snapshots
    are enabled each storage area has a corresponding snapshot file where
    prior versions of that area's records are maintained while the read-
    only transactions that preceded them are active. The disk space al-
    located to these snapshot files is dynamically extended as required.
    Snapshot files may truncated without taking the database off line
    or forcing users to log out.

 o  Storage maps are used to assign tables and indexes to storage ar-
    eas. Tables may be horizontally partitioned across storage areas
    based on the values of specific columns.

 o  Rows from tables sharing common domains can be clustered on com-
    mon pages.

 o  Columns defined as LIST OF BYTE VARYING may be stored in differ-
    ent storage areas than the tables that logically contain them. This
    arrangement permits the storage of a table's computational data to
    be managed on magnetic disk while the storage of its large objects
    are managed on WORM (write-once, read-many) media. The size of these
    objects is limited only by the size of their assigned storage ar-
    eas.

 o  Both B-Tree (sorted in ascending or descending order) and hash in-
    dexing are supported. Index storage is independent of table stor-
    age.

 o  Periodic reorganization of database is NOT required.

 OpenVMS Datatype Support

 DEC Rdb for supports the The following OpenVMS datatypes:

 o  ASCII text (1 to 16,383 bytes)

                                 10

 

 o  Varying string (1 to 16,383 bytes)

 o  Date

 o  Signed byte (1 byte)

 o  Signed word (16-bit) integer

 o  Signed longword (32-bit) integer

 o  Signed quadword (64-bit) integer

 o  Single precision floating point (F_floating)

 o  Double precision floating point (G_floating)

 o  List cursors (Segmented strings) for storing large amounts of un-
    structured data, such as documents, voice, or graphics

 VAXcluster Support

 o  DEC Rdb for OpenVMS VAX allows concurrent, multiple-processor database
    access in a VAXcluster environment. DEC Rdb for OpenVMS VAX auto-
    matically recovers the database if a processor in the VAXcluster
    fails, and provides optional after-image journaling to further pro-
    tect the integrity of the VAXcluster database.

 o  DEC Rdb for OpenVMS uses the OpenVMS distributed lock manager to
    synchronize cluster-wide updates to the database root file, to ini-
    tiate the automatic recovery process when a node fails, and to co-
    ordinate concurrent updates to the same database from processes run-
    ning on different nodes. In a VAXcluster environment, DEC Rdb pro-
    cesses running on AXP processors and DEC Rdb processes running on
    VAX processors can share concurrent access to the same physical DEC
    Rdb database.

 o  Properly configured VAXcluster environments provide improved lev-
    els of availability to DEC Rdb applications.

 o  DEC Rdb for OpenVMS VAX supports multiple versions of the RDBMS on
    a single node or VAXcluster.

 Distributed Database Environment

                                 11

 

 Distributed Unit of Work support, based on Digital's Two-Phased Com-
 mit protocol, DECdtm, allows updates to multiple, distributed databases
 to be synchronized within a single transaction.

 Installation of the DEC Data Distributor optional layered product with
 DEC Rdb for OpenVMS provides:

 o  Scheduled transfer of selected data to and from remote DEC Rdb, IBM
    DB2, ORACLE and SYBASE databases.

 o  Extraction rollup. Similar to extraction, with the additional ca-
    pability of extracting relations and fields from multiple source
    databases into a single, new target database.

 o  Store and forward replication. Once a target database has been cre-
    ated, updates to the source database are forwarded to the target
    database(s) at scheduled intervals or on demand.

 Application Portability

 o  DEC Rdb application programming may be ported from the OpenVMS VAX
    to OpenVMS AXP by recompiling and re-linking the programs using DEC
    Rdb for OpenVMS AXP and the OpenVMS AXP implementation of the ap-
    propriate language compiler(s). Differences in the 3GL compiler ver-
    sion or implementation may make minor changes to the source code
    necessary. This approach assumes that the source code is available
    and an equivalent 3GL compiler is available for use on the Open-
    VMS AXP Operating System.

 o  For DEC Rdb Applications where the source code or the required com-
    piler is not available and the application is based on DEC Rdb Ver-
    sion 4.0 or later, the OpenVMS VAX executable images may be directly
    translated to OpenVMS AXP executable images by the DECmigrate for
    OpenVMS AXP product. Although this approach will successfully port
    most OpenVMS VAX applications to OpenVMS AXP, the translation of
    all images is not guaranteed.




                                 12

 

 o  DEC Rdb for OpenVMS AXP and DEC Rdb for OpenVMS VAX share common
    on-disk file structures. Databases can be moved between these two
    platforms using the RMU/BACKUP and RMU/RESTORE utilities. In a VAX-
    cluster, processes on both platforms share concurrent access to com-
    mon DEC Rdb databases.

 o  Personal Use licenses issued for DEC Rdb for OpenVMS may be used
    with either an OpenVMS for VAX or OpenVMS for AXP platforms.

 Limits and Parameters

 o  Maximum number of tables in a database: 8,191

 o  Maximum number of views in a database: 53,247

 o  Maximum number of bytes in a record: 65,535

 o  Maximum number of fields in a relation: 2,000

 o  Maximum index key size: 254 bytes

 support includes the use of multibyte character sets in database ob-
 jects, literals and parameters; the ability to specify the lengths and
 offsets of database objects in terms of characters rather than bytes;

                                 13

 

 the use of more than one character set in a database; and support for
 the Kanji Character Set in accordance with JIS X0208-1983.

 The DEC ODBC Driver for MS Windows complies with the Microsoft Open
 Database Connectivity specification V1.0. It supports all Core and Level
 1 calls and many, but not all, Level 2 calls.
