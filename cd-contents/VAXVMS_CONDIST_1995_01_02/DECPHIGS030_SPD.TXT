    PRODUCT NAME:  DEC PHIGS for OpenVMS VAX, Version 3.0  SPD 29.38.12

    DESCRIPTION

    DEC PHIGS (Programmers Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System) for
    OpenVMS VAX is a sophisticated three dimensional (3D) graphics sup-
    port system that controls the definition, modification, and display
    of hierarchical graphics data. DEC PHIGS for OpenVMS VAX manages the
    organization and display of graphical data stored in a conceptually
    centralized database.

    DEC PHIGS for OpenVMS VAX is Digital Equipment Corporation's imple-
    mentation of the 1988 ANSI/ISO PHIGS standard for 3D device-independent
    graphics. DEC PHIGS for OpenVMS VAX provides the standard FORTRAN, C
    and Ada language bindings as well as a language-independent (PHIGS$)
    binding. DEC PHIGS for OpenVMS VAX is supported on most Digital pro-
    cessors running the OpenVMS VAX Operating System.

    DEC PHIGS for OpenVMS VAX is device independent. That is, the same pro-
    gram can generate graphical output on different devices without mod-
    ification to the source code. DEC PHIGS for OpenVMS VAX supports DECwin-
    dows, DECwindows Motif[R], or OpenVMS VAX Workstation Software (VWS).
    DEC PHIGS for OpenVMS VAX also supports most of the hardcopy devices
    supported by DEC GKS, such as the HP-GL[R] series of plotters and Dig-
    ital's compatible sixel devices, as well as all the terminals supported
    by DEC GKS.

    DEC PHIGS for OpenVMS VAX is a subroutine library packaged as a set
    of shareable images which the application program is linked against.
    The shareable images are activated at run-time as needed.

    Features

    Structure Storage

    DEC PHIGS for OpenVMS VAX maintains a graphical database known as struc-
    ture storage. Output primitives (polylines, polymarkers, etc.), at-
    tribute selection functions, labels, application data, name set spec-
    ifications, transformation selections, and structure references are
    all structure elements that are placed in the structure store. These

                                     2

    elements can be edited at any time by the application program. Graph-
    ical output is generated by a structure traversal mechanism that in-
    terprets items in the structure store.

    DEC PHIGS for OpenVMS VAX provides an alternate traversal mechanism
    called immediate mode. Using immediate mode, PHIGS primitives can be
    rendered directly to the display surface without being placed in struc-
    ture storage.

    Viewing Operations

    DEC PHIGS for OpenVMS VAX allows the definition of objects in their
    own "modeling" coordinate systems. Transformation functions are pro-
    vided to position these objects with respect to one another in a "world"
    coordinate system. World coordinates can have any scale. For example,
    one application might have a maximum range from 0 to 1000.0 while an-
    other application might limit the range from 0.01 to 0.1. DEC PHIGS
    for OpenVMS VAX automatically converts from the world coordinate sys-
    tems into coordinates appropriate for the display device being used.

    The user can control multiple simultaneous views of the same object
    on separate display surfaces, as well as the position and size of the
    picture on the surface.

    In addition to the PHIGS standard viewing model, DEC PHIGS for Open-
    VMS VAX also provides alternate viewing functionality commonly known
    as "posting to views."

    Control Functions

    DEC PHIGS for OpenVMS VAX provides special functions for management
    of the picture process including PHIGS initialization and termination,
    and functions that control the opening and closing of logical graph-
    ical devices.

    Output Functions

    DEC PHIGS for OpenVMS VAX provides functions for creating both 2D and
    3D graphics elements in structure storage. Some of these functions al-
    low lighting and shading information to be specified. These functions
    are:

    Polyline     -  Draws one or more connected line segments.

    Polymarker   -  Draws one or more symbols which can mark signifi-
                    cant points in a picture.

                    played in a variety of fonts and orientations.
                    Text size is affected by transformations.

    Fill Area    -  Draws a polygonal area which can be hollow or
                    filled with a uniform color or a hatch style.

    Fill Area    -  Draws a set of polygonal areas with holes or dis-
    Set             joint regions that are treated as a single entity.
                    Control of edge attributes is provided with this
                    primitive.

    Annotation   -  Draws a character string in an X-Y plane (always
    Text            readable). Characters can be displayed in a va-
    Relative        riety of fonts and orientations. Text size is not
                    affected by transformations, but text position is
                    affected.

    Circle and   -  Draws a circle or circular arc at the specified
    Circular        position in 2D form.
    Arc

    Triangle     -  Generates a sequence of triangles. Each trian-
    Strip           gle shares an edge with the next triangle in the
                    strip.

    Quadrilateral-  Generates a sequence of quadrilateral polygons.
    Mesh

    Indexed      -  Generates a sequence of polygons that permits
    Polygons        PHIGS to take advantage of shared vertices.

    NURBs        -  Non-Uniform Rational B-spline. Generates a 3D
                    curve or surface from user-specified control
                    points and approximation criteria.

    Attributes

    Each output function has an associated set of attributes which con-
    trol the appearance of the output. Attributes can be defined in groups
    (bundles) or individually. Attributes are:

    Line Type    -  The programmer can control the style of a line.
                    For example, lines can be dotted or dashed.

    Line Width   -  In addition to line type, the width of the line
                    can be controlled.

    Color        -  Color selection is performed by selecting one of
                    the predefined colors or by specifying the red,
                    green, and blue intensities required to define a
                    particular color on color devices.

    Character    -  A specific font, as well as the character spac-
    Attributes      ing, height, angle, path, and alignment, can be
                    specified.

    Input Functions

    DEC PHIGS for OpenVMS VAX supports synchronous and asynchronous in-
    put using any of the six different input methods listed below.

    Locator      -  Returns a point in the user's world coordinate
                    system.

    Stroke       -  Returns a series of points in the user's world
                    coordinate system.

    Valuator     -  Returns a single floating point value within a
                    specified range.

    Choice       -  Returns a single non-negative integer within a
                    specified range.

    String       -  Returns a string of characters.

    Pick         -  Returns a pick path which consists of a list of
                    structure identifier, pick identifier, and element
                    number for each level in the structure network.

    Name Sets

    DEC PHIGS for OpenVMS VAX includes the concept of name sets. Individ-
    ual primitives can be associated with members of a name set that is
    used to determine eligibility for highlighting, visibility, and pick-
    ing. For example, in an architectural drawing, all steam pipes can be
    associated with one member of a name set and all water pipes with an-
    other. These sets of pipes can then be made invisible, pickable, or
    highlighted as a group.

    Inquiry Functions

    DEC PHIGS for OpenVMS VAX provides a complete set of inquiry functions
    which aid in developing modular, device-independent programs.

    PHIGS Archive Files

    DEC PHIGS for OpenVMS VAX provides an interface to archive files which
    allows for all or part of structure storage to be saved for later re-
    call. Archive files can be used for the following purposes:

    o  Saving and restoring graphical information between sessions

    o  Transporting graphical information between Digital systems with com-
       patible versions of DEC PHIGS

    o  Transporting graphical information from one DEC PHIGS application
       to another DEC PHIGS application

    o  Storing accompanying nongraphical information

    Character Fonts

    DEC PHIGS for OpenVMS VAX provides a series of stroke precision char-
    acter fonts. These character fonts were digitized by Dr. Allen V. Her-
    shey of the Naval Surface Weapons Laboratory and supplied to Digital
    by the National Bureau of Standards. Language Binding

    DEC PHIGS for OpenVMS VAX functions can be accessed by five sets of
    subroutine calls or bindings as the PHIGS standards refer to them. DEC
    PHIGS for OpenVMS VAX provides an interface which conforms to a draft
    version of the PHIGS C binding standard for backward compatibility with
    previous versions of DEC PHIGS as well a C binding that conforms to
    the final ANSI/ISO C binding standard. The other three bindings are
    an Ada binding which conforms to a draft of the PHIGS Ada binding stan-
    dard, a FORTRAN binding which conforms to the final ISO PHIGS FORTRAN
    binding standard, and a Digital-specified PHIGS$ interface which fol-
    lows the standard OpenVMS VAX calling conventions and is callable from
    many different languages.

    The FORTRAN, C, and Ada binding interfaces allow users to transport
    PHIGS applications written in FORTRAN, C, or Ada across heterogeneous
    operating systems with conforming implementations of PHIGS and the FOR-
    TRAN, C, or Ada bindings. Calls to either of the C language bindings
    cannot be mixed with calls to the other language bindings in the same
    application.

    Graphic Handlers

    DEC PHIGS for OpenVMS VAX provides support for a wide variety of Dig-
    ital and non-Digital graphics devices. In addition, users can develop
    their own graphic device handlers for devices that Digital does not
    support via the DEC GKS 2D device handler interface. This is described
    in  Building a DEC GKS Device Handler System manual, which can be pur-
    chased separately (Order No. AA-MJ33A-TE). Device handlers can be de-
    veloped in VAX FORTRAN, VAX C, and VAX Pascal.

    DEC PHIGS for OpenVMS VAX, Version 3.0                SPD 29.38.12


    DEC PHIGS for OpenVMS VAX provides support for storing information us-
    ing the Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM). CGM is an approved ANSI stan-
    dard format (ANSI X3.122-1986). DEC PHIGS supports CGM output for the
    following formats:

    Clear Text Encoding - Graphical output data stored in the clear text
    format is easily created, viewed, and modified using a common text ed-
    itor. It is also a suitable format for transferring graphical output
    data through networks that only support the transfer of a text file.

    Character Encoding - Graphical output data is typically stored in the
    character format for minimal file size. Data stored in this format is
    particularly suitable for transfer through networks that cannot sup-
    port binary transfers.

    Binary Encoding - Graphical output data stored in binary format is very
    compact and the fastest to read and write. However, it is the least
    suitable for transmission over communications lines as all 8 bits in
    each byte are meaningful. DEC PHIGS Run-Time Only License

    Since DEC PHIGS for OpenVMS VAX is a graphics application development
    tool, Digital provides a Run-Time Only License for running graphics
    applications that were developed using DEC PHIGS graphics. This li-
    cense is offered at a substantially reduced cost per CPU. The DEC PHIGS
    Run-Time License does not allow the user to create new applications,
    but rather allows execution of applications that were previously de-
    veloped on a CPU where the full PHIGS product has been installed un-
    der a Single Use License option.

    Memory Requirements for DECwindows and DECwindows Motif Support

    The minimum supported memory for this application running in a stan-
    dalone DECwindows or DECwindows Motif environment with both the client
    and server executing on that same system is 24 MB.

    The performance and memory usage of DECwindows and DECwindows Motif
    applications are particularly sensitive to system configuration. Less
    memory may be required on the client system (the system where the soft-
    ware is installed and executed) if the server (the component that dis-
    plays the application) resides on another system. More memory may be
    required on a system with several applications running, or where it
    may be desirable to improve the performance of an application.
