 PRODUCT NAME:  VAXuisx and VWS Migration Tools Kit, Version 1.1 SPD
 33.58.01

 DESCRIPTION

 VAXuisx Run-Time Library for VMS[*], Version 1.2 allows most exist-
 ing applications written for the VWS windowing system to run under the
 DECwindows windowing system. VAXuisx accomplishes this by providing
 a new run-time library that uses the Xlib program interface for draw-
 ing and input services. UIS routines are redirected to the new UISXSHR
 run-time image. Therefore, most applications do not need to relink or
 install native VWS.

 VAXuisx Features

 o  Emulates most VWS routines by using X11 (does not emulate DOPs, com-
    mon video QIO interfaces, tablets, or shared color maps).

 o  Emulates VWS virtual color maps by using X11 routines.

 o  Supports all of the VWS writing modes.

 o  The standard VWS patterns are built into VAXuisx.

 o  Provides the standard VWS fonts in DECwindows format.

 SIGHT (Simple Interactive Graphics Handling Tool), Version 4.5 - This
 package enables the user to create graphics on a workstation. These
 graphics are stored in files for graphic output to hardcopy devices.
 These files can then be updated and/or transferred/copied to other sup-
 ported VAXstations.

 Hardcopy UIS (HCUIS), Version 4.5 - For applications requiring the gen-
 eration of hardcopy output of graphics, Hardcopy UIS (HCUIS) is pro-
 vided. HCUIS enables applications to translate VWS display lists to
 the formats needed to print them on a variety of hardcopy devices. The
 HCUIS routines also enable applications to create UIS files from the
 VWS display list. The HCUIS DCL interface also enables users to trans-
 late UIS files to the formats needed to print them on a variety of hard-
 copy devices.

 UIS to DDIF Converter, Version 2.2 - This tool allows the conversion
 of UIS metafiles created by Hardcopy UIS (this includes SIGHT files)
 into any output format supported by the CDA Converter Library.

 UIS Source Code Annotator, Version 2.0 - The UIS Source Code Annota-
 tor helps to migrate VWS applications to DECwindows. It gives infor-
 mation which can be used in porting VWS applications to DECwindows.
 By running a VWS application through the Annotator, users can learn
 which UIS routines have equivalent Xlib routines and what those rou-
 tines are. Users also can learn which UIS routines have no equivalent
 Xlib routines. The Annotator should be used along with A Guide to Mi-
 grating VWS Applications to DECwindows.

 A Guide to Migrating VWS Applications to DECwindows, Version 1.0 - This
 document provides information to aid software developers and archi-
 tects in migrating existing VWS applications to the DECwindows plat-
 form by pointing out the differences between the two platforms and by
 providing programming examples in a ported application written specif-
 ically for this purpose.

 VWS Demo Kit, Version 4.5 - The VWS Demo kit is a collection of VWS
 applications written in a variety of languages. Most of these demon-
 stration programs include both source code and executables as part of
 the kit.
