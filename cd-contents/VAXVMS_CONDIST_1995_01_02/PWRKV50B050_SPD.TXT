 PRODUCT NAME:  PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS                SPD 30.50.15

 DESCRIPTION

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) is an OpenVMS layered appli-
 cation that provides the functions of a Microsoft[R] LAN Manager V2.2
 server in a PC LAN environment with additional features. It is a mem-
 ber of the PATHWORKS family of products which provides a framework for
 integrating personal computers into an organization's total informa-
 tion system, allowing different types of users to share information
 and network services across the entire organization.

 The PATHWORKS family includes PC LAN server products running on Open-
 VMS, DEC OSF/1[R], ULTRIX, SCO[TM] UNIX[R], and OS/2[R] platforms pro-
 viding industry-standard Network Operating System (NOS) services that
 utilize Novell[R]'s NetWare[TM], Microsoft[R]'s LAN Manager, and Ap-
 ple[R]'s AppleShare[R] protocols. The PATHWORKS family also includes
 client software for these servers, consisting of a multi-NOS manage-
 ment interface called ManageWORKS, enterprisewide support capabili-
 ties such as wide area transports (DECnet and TCP/IP), and applica-
 tions such as Mail and Terminal Emulation, allowing DOS, Windows[TM],
 Windows NT[R], OS/2, and Macintosh[R] clients to participate as full
 peers in a widely-distributed computing environment.

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS adds a new dimension to general purpose Open-
 VMS VAX and OpenVMS AXP systems. In addition to providing traditional
 support for business, scientific, and engineering applications, this
 product allows an OpenVMS system to appear to LAN Manager clients as
 a Microsoft LAN Manager server. PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS is an imple-
 mentation of industry-standard Microsoft LAN Manager V2.2.

 The major features of PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS are described below.

 File Services

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS provides LAN Manager-based clients with a re-
 mote file system that appears as a transparent extension of the client
 system's local computing environment.

 PATHWORKS for OpenVMS file shares are based on Microsoft's LAN Man-
 ager V2.2 SMB (Server Message Block) protocols.

 Each file stored in a file service is stored as an OpenVMS file in RMS
 format. Three types of RMS file/record formats are allowed and sup-
 ported on each volume:

 -  Sequential Stream

 -  Sequential Fixed Length Record (512 bytes/record)

 -  Sequential Undefined

 Files stored in a file service are accessible to PC clients, OpenVMS
 users, and to applications that can interpret the content and orga-
 nization of the file as written by the client application.

 Multiple LAN Manager clients can concurrently access files stored on
 the server's disk through the file access modes and byte range lock-
 ing support provided by the OpenVMS Operating System.

 Print Services

 PATHWORKS for OpenVMS software allows DOS, Windows, Windows NT, OS/2,
 and OpenVMS users to share printers connected to Alpha AXP, VAX, or
 VAXserver computers and to VMScluster systems, as well as network-based
 printers such as LAT printers and Digital PrintServers. Print services

                                  2

 

 are supported in local area and wide area network environments. PC clients
 can print files from the DOS, OS/2, Windows, and Windows NT operat-
 ing systems as well as from PC applications.

 Multiple print services may be defined for a single printer. For ex-
 ample, separate services may be created for landscape-mode printing
 and portrait-mode printing. Similarly, separate services may be cre-
 ated for Digital mode and IBM[R] ProPrinter[R] mode printing for a sin-
 gle LA75 printer.

 Sharing of Network Resources By Heterogeneous Users

 Services provided by PATHWORKS for OpenVMS are accessible to PATHWORKS
 LAN Manager-based clients as well as to Microsoft LAN Manager clients.
 All clients using the services of a PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS server
 must be properly licensed. (See the Software Licensing section of this
 SPD.) Files are stored on the server in native OpenVMS Record Manage-
 ment Services (RMS) format. This allows information stored by the PCs
 via PATHWORKS for OpenVMS to be shared with traditional OpenVMS users.
 In addition, this feature allows information to be shared among all
 PATHWORKS clients, including those not based on LAN Manager technol-
 ogy.

 Network Transport Support

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS supports DECnet, DECnet/OSI, TCP/IP, and Net-
 BEUI network transport software. One or multiple transport stacks can
 work concurrently on the server.

 When TCP/IP support is needed, users will require an upgrade of their
 OpenVMS-based TCP/IP transport to function with PATHWORKS V5.0A for
 OpenVMS. The TCP/IP transport, which is sold as a separate product from
 various vendors, must include support for the PATHWORKS IP (PWIP) driver.

 NetBEUI transport software is included with the PATHWORKS V5 for Open-
 VMS software. Using NetBEUI transport software, LAN Manager clients
 can access the server in the local area network for file and print ser-
 vices. Clients using PATHWORKS DECnet or TCP/IP client software can
 access the server for file and print services in local and wide area
 networks.

                                  3

 

 See the Software Requirements section of this SPD for information on
 supported network transport software.

 NetBIOS[TM] Interface Support

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS supports the NetBIOS interface in DECnet, TCP
 /IP, and NetBEUI networks. PATHWORKS for OpenVMS utilizes NetBIOS nam-
 ing services and datagram services. A NetBIOS programming interface
 is not provided, however. NetBIOS interface support includes the sup-
 port of multiple transport stacks on a single or different network con-
 trollers. NetBIOS support under TCP/IP includes a b-node RFC 1001/1002
 implementation. This implies that the NetBIOS interface is supported
 under TCP/IP in local area network environments only.

 Flexible Security Models

 The PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS security model accommodates both the LAN
 Manager security model and the OpenVMS security model. The server may
 be configured to use the security implementation best suited to the
 environment. In "LAN Manager Only" mode, the LAN Manager security model
 is enforced. In "LAN Manager and OpenVMS" mode, both the OpenVMS and
 LAN Manager security models are enforced. In "LAN Manager and Creator"
 mode, OpenVMS security is applied to files not created by users of the
 PATHWORKS server.

 Domain Support

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS allows the network to be subdivided into ad-
 ministrative groupings of servers and clients called domains. A do-
 main is a group of servers and clients on a LAN. A domain is the ba-
 sic unit of network administration and each server running PATHWORKS
 for OpenVMS can be a member of a single domain. A PATHWORKS for Open-
 VMS server can be either a Primary Domain Controller, Backup Domain
 Controller, Member Server, or a Standalone Server. Domains are a con-
 venient mechanism for controlling user access to the network, and for
 managing large networks.

 Network Logon Services


                                  4

 

 The domain capabilities of LAN Manager make it possible for a user to
 issue a single logon request in order to gain access to multiple servers
 in a LAN. Running the netlogon service forces the validation of users'
 logon requests. The logon server that processes the request checks its
 copy of the domainwide user accounts database for the user name and
 password supplied in the logon request.

 LAN Manager V2.2 API Support

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS supports the LAN Manager V2.2 Application Pro-
 gramming Interfaces, with the exception of Named Pipes and Mailslots.
 Note that LAN Manager APIs are not available to OpenVMS host-based ap-
 plications, but are available to PATHWORKS LAN Manager-based clients,
 non-PATHWORKS LAN Manager clients, and OS/2 LAN Manager servers.

 Remote Boot

 The remote boot service included with PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS allows
 DOS and Windows workstations to start up using information stored on
 the server's hard disk instead of on their own local hard disks. The
 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS remote boot service is based on Microsoft's
 LAN Manager remote boot service, which uses the Remote Program Load
 (RPL) protocol. Remote boot is supported over NetBEUI on Ethernet net-
 works. PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS supports MOP (Maintenance Operation
 Protocol) as a secondary loader for clients without an RPL ROM.

 Mail Services

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS includes a mail server component which al-
 lows clients to send and receive electronic mail. The mail server is
 based on the OpenVMS MAIL-11 product and requires DECnet as its com-
 munications transport. It allows users of PATHWORKS Mail client soft-
 ware to send and receive electronic mail messages without having to
 log in to the OpenVMS system as an interactive user.

 A mail account may be established on the OpenVMS server for each user.
 Mail can be sent to this account by other PATHWORKS Mail users as well
 as traditional users of OpenVMS mail software. The mail server then
 routes messages to the appropriate client when the user logs onto the
 server.

 The PATHWORKS for OpenVMS mail server provides the PATHWORKS user with
 folders, distribution lists, and delivery capabilities. Realtime no-
 tification of new messages can be optionally enabled by the client.

 Time and Date Services

                                  6

 

 DOS, Windows, and OS/2 clients can request date and time information
 from the server system and set the local workstation date and time to
 coincide with them.

 PATHWORKS FAT File System

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS includes an alternative to the native Open-
 VMS ODS-2 file system, called PATHWORKS FAT File System. It is based
 on the DOS File Allocation Table (FAT) file system. PC files stored
 in the FAT file system are stored in native DOS format in a container
 file on the server system. Attributes of the PATHWORKS FAT file sys-
 tem include:

 -  multiple readers and writers of the container file

 -  files stored on the server in DOS format are accessible in a wide-
    area network

 -  performance on file and directory operations is better than on the
    OpenVMS ODS-2 file system

 The PATHWORKS FAT file system may be used as a migration path from ex-
 isting PATHWORKS V4.x disk service container files (see Accommodation
 of Retired Features).

 Server Management and Control

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS supports several server management interfaces:

 -  ManageWORKS, a Windows-based utility supplied with the PATHWORKS
    V5 for DOS and Windows client product

 -  A character cell utility called ADMINISTRATE/PATHWORKS which is used
    at the server console

 -  The LAN Manager NET ADMIN command line interface which may be used
    from the server console, or from a PATHWORKS LAN Manager client or
    other LAN Manager client system

 The management utilities can be used to:

 o  Manage file and printer shares, user accounts, and groups

                                  7

 

 o  Display and control server resources currently in use, such as ac-
    tive sessions, connections, services, and server statistics

 o  View context-sensitive Help for each menu item and command

 PATHWORKS Monitor

 The PATHWORKS Monitor utility is a Windows-based application provided
 with the PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS server software. PATHWORKS Monitor
 collects data on server resource utilization and provides a real-time
 graphical display of this information.

 PostScript[R] Printing Capabilities

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS includes the DECprint Supervisor (DCPS) Open
 product, which provides PostScript and DEC ANSI printing to selected
 industry-standard PostScript printers.

 Enhanced Cluster Support

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS includes support for a transport-independent
 PATHWORKS cluster alias name service that allows multiple cluster mem-
 bers to appear as a single server to the connecting clients, provid-
 ing higher availability. The PATHWORKS cluster alias name has a load-
 balancing feature which connects clients to the cluster member that
 is the least loaded at the time of the connection. PATHWORKS V5 for
 OpenVMS also includes a high performance cluster-wide distributed data
 cache. VAX clusters, AXP clusters, and mixed-architecture clusters are
 supported by PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS.

 Enhanced Performance via XQP+

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS includes a special release of the enhanced
 OpenVMS file system, known as XQP+ (eXtended QIO Processor Plus). XQP+
 is separately installable to OpenVMS VAX V5.5-2 and OpenVMS VAX V6.0
 systems. When PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS detects the existence of the
 enhanced file system, it automatically takes advantage of its improved
 concurrency, multi-threading, and directory caching features to pro-
 vide better performance to file system operations.

 Installation Utilities

                                  8

 

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS is installed on the OpenVMS system using the
 standard VMSINSTAL procedure. An Installation Verification Procedure
 (IVP) is also included, which can be used to confirm that the server
 software has been installed properly.

 Digital recommends that a customer's first purchase of this software
 product at each site include Digital installation service. Contact your
 local Digital representative for information on the service options
 available.

 License Management

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS includes license management software which
 provides capabilities for managing both client-based and server-based
 PATHWORKS licenses.

 o  Client-based License Management

 PATHWORKS client licenses are delivered as Product Authorization Keys
 (PAKs) for Digital's standard License Management Facility (LMF). The
 license PAKs must be entered into an LMF database, using standard LMF
 procedures, on a system that will be used as a PATHWORKS License Server
 (see below). The License Server software is provided with PATHWORKS
 V5 for OpenVMS.

 The PATHWORKS V5 software provides important capabilities in support
 of PATHWORKS client license management:

    -  Included with the PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS software is a PATH-
       WORKS License Server capability which, upon request from a client
       workstation, will acquire a client license from the local LMF
       database, provide it to the client, and record the event. This
       PATHWORKS License Server is also used by the client periodically
       to verify that its license is still valid.

    -  The PATHWORKS License Manager provides the system manager with
       the ability to monitor client license usage. The PATHWORKS Li-
       cense Manager can also be used to preallocate licenses to spe-
       cific groups of users and to reclaim a license from a client.

                                  9

 

    -  Another capability in the PATHWORKS V5 server software, the Li-
       cense Registrar, will "handshake" with clients requesting ac-
       cess to server functions. Clients that can successfully "hand-
       shake" with the server and produce a valid client license will
       be allowed access to the services offered by PATHWORKS V5 for
       OpenVMS.

 o  Server-based License Management

 The PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS server is also capable of allowing client
 access based on a local server-based license. If a client requesting
 access to the server fails to produce a valid client license, the Li-
 cense Registrar software will then check the local LMF database for
 the availability of a PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS FPS (File and Print Server)
 license. If one is available, and the number of concurrently-connected
 clients allowed by the license has not been exceeded, the client will
 be allowed access.

 Note that both server-based and client-based license management are
 always active simultaneously on PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS servers. How-
 ever, clients that do have a valid client-based license are already
 licensed to use the server software and, therefore, are not counted
 against the fixed number of clients granted access by the server-based
 FPS license.

 Accommodation of Retired Features

 The following features of PATHWORKS V4.x for OpenVMS are no longer pro-
 vided in PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS:

 o  File services over LAST

 o  Disk services

 o  Remote boot over LAST

 If PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS is installed on a server system which had
 been running V4.x of the product, some aspects of the V4.x environ-
 ment related to the features listed above will be preserved. Disk ser-
 vices will remain intact and available to pre-V5 clients. LAST-based

                                 10

 

 remote boot services will also remain intact and available to pre-V5
 clients.

 SOFTWARE LICENSING

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS can be licensed in two different ways.

 o  Client-based licensing (CCS & FPA licenses)

 This product can be licensed for operation and access on any number
 of supported platforms when appropriate client-based licenses are pur-
 chased for clients using the services of this product.

                                 20

 

 See the attached PATHWORKS license terms and conditions for Combina-
 tion Client Server ("CCS", in section 1) and File and Print Access ("FPA",
 in section 2) licenses for a description of the specific rights granted.
 See below for ordering information.

 o  Server-based licensing (FPS)

 A PATHWORKS File and Print Server (FPS) license for this product per-
 mits its use on a single supported system and allows access by clients
 that do not have a PATHWORKS client-based license.

 See the attached PATHWORKS License terms and conditions for File and
 Print Server ("FPS", in section 4) licenses for a description of the
 specific rights granted. See below for ordering information.

 Note: The licensing options described above are not mutually exclusive.
 Differing levels of service required by a heterogeneous community of
 end-users could suggest the use of both licensing methods, simulta-
 neously, for some environments.

 Clients with client-based licenses for server access do not interfere
 with the access of other clients that rely on server-based licensing
 for access to a particular server. The two licensing methods are de-
 signed to coexist.

 ORDERING INFORMATION

 Client-based Licenses

 Use of the PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS software may be licensed on a per-
 client basis, using the licenses described below.
