 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC Rdb for OpenVMS[1] VAX, Version 4.2 SPD 25.59.15
                Relational Database Management System

 DESCRIPTION

 DEC Rdb for OpenVMS VAX is a full-function, SQL-based relational database
 management system designed for the OpenVMS operating system. It is in-
 tended for general purpose, multi-user, centralized, or distributed
 applications.

 DEC Rdb for OpenVMS VAX supports a complete set of languages, util-
 ities, and precompilers that enable users to maintain and manipulate
 databases. DEC Rdb for OpenVMS VAX implements ANSI/ISO SQL as its stan-
 dard interface to the database, and has validated against the FIPS 127-
 1 SQL Validation test suite with zero nonconformities.

 DEC Rdb for OpenVMS VAX also includes SQL/Services, a client/server
 protocol that provides remote access to DEC Rdb for OpenVMS VAX databases
 from various desktop platforms.

 Features

 Data Definition Language (DDL)

 Users can issue DDL statements through the interactive SQL and RDO util-
 ities, the SQL precompilers, or the SQL module language in order to
 accomplish the following:

 o  Create schemas (database), tables (relations), views, columns (fields),
    domains (global fields), and indexes (both ascending and descend-
    ing)

 o  Create storage areas for tables and indexes

 ____________________

 The   terms VMS and OpenVMS refer to the OpenVMS operating system.

                                  6

 

 Physical Storage Characteristics

 o  Data in the database is kept either in a single file or distributed
    between multiple files across a single or multiple volumes. Each
    database storage area (file) has an accompanying file which can be
    used during read-only "snapshot" operations.

    -  A single file database can span multiple disk volumes when it
       exceeds the storage capacity of a single disk structure.

    -  The multifile database feature allows the database to be dis-
       tributed among multiple volumes on the same node or cluster per
       user specification.

 o  A storage area may be defined as read-only

 o  Table structure

    -  Duplicate rows can be eliminated

    -  No required ordering of columns on storage or retrieval

 o  Storage structure

    -  B-Tree (sorted in ascending or descending order) or hash indexes
       on tables

    -  Periodic reorganization of database is NOT required

 o  Data types

    -  ASCII text (1 to 16383 bytes)

    -  Varying string (1 to 16383 bytes)

    -  Date

    -  Signed byte (1 byte)

    -  Signed word (16-bit) integer

    -  Signed longword (32-bit) integer

    -  Signed quadword (64-bit) integer

    -  Single precision floating point (F_floating)

    -  Double precision floating point (G_floating)

                                  7

 

    -  List cursors (Segmented strings) for storing large amounts of
       unstructured data, such as documents, voice, or graphics

    SQL/Services supports the following data types only:

       ASCIZ - Null terminated ASCII string used to represent all strings,
       numeric values, and dates.
       VARCHAR - Signed word integer followed by an array of 8-bit bytes
       used to store any type of data, including binary. The maximum
       number of bytes in a VARCHAR data item is 16383.
       List cursors (Segmented strings)

 Remote Database Access

 o  Application programs developed to access DEC Rdb databases and run-
    ning under OpenVMS on a given node in a DECnet network can:

    -  Access DEC Rdb databases on the same node

    -  Access DEC Rdb databases on other OpenVMS nodes in the network

 o  SQL/Services provides remote access to DEC Rdb databases. Appli-
    cation programs interface to SQL/Services through an Application
    Programming Interface (API) set of callable routines. These rou-
    tines communicate via DECnet or TCP/IP with the target database through
    the SQL/Services server process residing on the OpenVMS system. The
    OpenVMS server can also work with the RdbAccess data access prod-
    ucts to retrieve data from other systems. Client application pro-
    gramming libraries are provided for OpenVMS, ULTRIX, MS-DOS, MS-
    Windows, Sun[R], OS/2, and Macintosh.

 Data Dictionary

 o  Stores data definitions in the database file itself, in the form
    of tables

 o  Allows online retrieval of data definitions

 o  Allows modification of data definitions using interactive data def-
    inition language

                                  8

 

 o  Allows storage of data definitions in Digital's repository, CDD/Repository.
    The use of CDD/Repository is optional but recommended. Using CDD
    /Repository to store definitions for a DEC Rdb database allows users
    to:

    -  Define fields and relations in the database based on dictionary
       definitions

    -  Share standard definitions among several databases

    -  Analyze the impact of changing shared definitions

    Sharing common dictionary definitions provides consistency of def-
    initions across the database and other software products as users
    develop an application.

 VAXcluster/Local Area VAXcluster

 o  DEC Rdb for OpenVMS VAX supports multiple versions of the RDBMS on
    a single node or cluster (Versions 4.0 and above).

 o  DEC Rdb for OpenVMS VAX allows concurrent, multiple-processor database
    access in a VAXcluster environment. DEC Rdb for OpenVMS VAX auto-
    matically recovers the database if a processor in the VAXcluster
    fails, and provides optional after-image journaling to further pro-
    tect the integrity of the VAXcluster database.

 o  DEC Rdb for OpenVMS VAX uses the OpenVMS distributed lock manager
    to synchronize cluster-wide updates to the database root file, to
    initiate the automatic recovery process when a node fails, and to
    coordinate concurrent updates to the same database from processes
    running on different nodes.

 o  VAXclusters offer higher availability to DEC Rdb for OpenVMS VAX
    databases in a properly configured VAXcluster environment.

 Distributed Database Environment

 Installation of the VAX Data Distributor optional layered product with
 DEC Rdb for OpenVMS provides:

 o  Extraction of entire databases, or parts of them, into target databases
    on remote systems.

                                  9

 

 o  Extraction rollup, which is similar to extraction, with the addi-
    tional capability of extracting relations and fields from multi-
    ple source databases into a single, new target database.

 o  Store and forward replication. Once a target database has been cre-
    ated, updates to the source database are forwarded to the target
    database(s) at scheduled intervals or on demand.

 Limits and Parameters

 o  Maximum number of tables in a database: 8,191

 o  Maximum number of views in a database: 53,247

 o  Maximum number of bytes in a record: 65,535

 o  Maximum number of fields in a relation: 2,000

 o  Maximum index key size: 254 bytes

 o  Maximum length of a database object name: 31 characters

 o  Minimum database page size: 512 bytes

 o  Maximum size of database file: limited by available physical de-
    vices

 o  Maximum number of database attaches: 2,032

 o  Maximum tables in a join: 32
