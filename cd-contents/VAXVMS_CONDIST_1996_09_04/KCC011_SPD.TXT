 PRODUCT NAME:  KAP[TM] for DEC C Version 1.5 for OpenVMS AXP and SPD
 38.51.02                KAP for VAX C Version 1.1

 DESCRIPTION

 This document describes the following two products:

 o  KAP[TM] for DEC C Version 1.5 for OpenVMS AXP

 o  KAP for VAX C Version 1.1

 The KAP for C preprocessors are developed by Kuck and Associates, Inc.
 and distributed under Digital Equipment Corporation's Standard Terms
 and Conditions. The KAP for VAX C version is intended for use with the
 VAX C compiler and OpenVMS VAX systems. The KAP for DEC C version works
 with the DEC C compiler on OpenVMS AXP systems.

 KAP for C is a C-language source-to-source preprocessor that restruc-
 tures code for improved performance. Some of the transformations that
 may be performed include function inlining, loop unrolling, loop fu-
 sion, and loop peeling. KAP also optimizes the use of registers and
 cache memories.

 KAP for C has a set of default transformations selected to provide im-
 proved performance for a wide class of programs. While the default trans-
 formations provide an easy means to get started, KAP provides a large
 set of command qualifiers and in-source directives and assertions that
 the advanced user can use to customize KAP transformations for a par-
 ticular application program.
