 PRODUCT NAME:  PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS                SPD 30.50.18

 DESCRIPTION

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) is an OpenVMS layered appli-
 cation that provides the functions of a Microsoft[R] LAN Manager V2.2
 server in a PC LAN environment with additional features. It is a mem-
 ber of the PATHWORKS family of products, which provides a framework
 for integrating personal computers into an organization's total in-
 formation system, allowing users to share information and network ser-
 vices across the entire organization.

 The PATHWORKS family includes PC LAN server products running on Open-
 VMS, Digital UNIX, ULTRIX, SCO[TM] UNIX[R], and OS/2[R] platforms pro-
 viding industry-standard Network Operating System (NOS) services that
 utilize Novell[R]'s NetWare[TM], Microsoft[R]'s LAN Manager, and Ap-
 ple[R]'s AppleShare[R] protocols. The PATHWORKS family also includes
 client software for these servers, consisting of a multi-NOS manage-
 ment interface called ManageWORKS, enterprisewide support capabili-
 ties such as wide area transports (DECnet and TCP/IP), and applica-
 tions such as Mail and Terminal Emulation, allowing DOS, Windows[TM],
 Windows NT[R], Windows95, Windows for Workgroups, OS/2, and Macintosh[R]

                                                            May 1996

 clients to participate as full peers in a distributed computing en-
 vironment.

 Features

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS adds a new dimension to general purpose Open-
 VMS systems. In addition to providing traditional support for busi-
 ness, scientific, and engineering applications, this product allows
 an OpenVMS system to appear to LAN Manager clients as a Microsoft LAN
 Manager server. PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS is an implementation of industry-
 standard Microsoft LAN Manager V2.2.

 The major features of PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS are described below.

 File Services

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS provides LAN Manager-based clients with a re-
 mote file system that appears as a transparent extension of the client
 system's local computing environment.

 PATHWORKS for OpenVMS file shares are based on Microsoft's LAN Man-
 ager V2.2 SMB (Server Message Block) protocols.

 Each file stored in a file service is stored as an OpenVMS file in RMS
 format. Three types of RMS file/record formats are allowed and sup-
 ported on each volume:

 -  Sequential Stream

 -  Sequential Fixed Length Record (512 bytes/record)

 -  Sequential Undefined

 Files stored in a file service are accessible to PC clients, OpenVMS
 users, and to applications that can interpret the content and orga-
 nization of the file as written by the client application.

 Multiple LAN Manager clients can concurrently access files stored on
 the server's disk through the file access modes and byte range lock-
 ing support provided by the OpenVMS Operating System.

 Print Services

                                  2

 

 PATHWORKS for OpenVMS software allows DOS, Windows, Windows NT, Win-
 dows 95, OS/2, and OpenVMS users to share printers connected to Al-
 pha, VAX, or VAXserver computers and to VMScluster systems, as well
 as network-based printers such as LAT printers and Digital PrintServers.
 Print services are supported in local area and wide area network en-
 vironments. PC clients can print files from the DOS, OS/2, Windows,
 Windows95, and Windows NT operating systems as well as from PC appli-
 cations.

 Multiple print services may be defined for a single printer. For ex-
 ample, separate services may be created for landscape-mode printing
 and portrait-mode printing. Similarly, separate services may be cre-
 ated for Digital mode and IBM[R] ProPrinter[R] mode printing for a sin-
 gle LA75 printer.

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS includes the DECprint Supervisor (DCPS) Open
 product, which provides PostScript and DEC ANSI printing to selected
 industry-standard PostScript printers.

 Sharing of Network Resources By Heterogeneous Users

 Services provided by PATHWORKS for OpenVMS are accessible to PATHWORKS
 LAN Manager-based clients as well as to Microsoft LAN Manager clients.
 All clients using the services of a PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS server
 must be properly licensed. (See the Software Licensing section of this
 SPD.) Files are stored on the server in native OpenVMS Record Manage-
 ment Services (RMS) format. This allows information stored by the PCs
 using PATHWORKS for OpenVMS to be shared with traditional OpenVMS users.
 In addition, this feature allows information to be shared among all
 PATHWORKS clients, including those not based on LAN Manager technol-
 ogy. Concurrent file access by host applications or non-LAN Manager
 clients is not supported.

 Network Transport Support

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS supports DECnet, DECnet/OSI, TCP/IP, and Net-
 BEUI network transport software. One or multiple transport stacks can
 work concurrently on the server.


                                  3

 

 The TCP/IP transport, which is sold as a separate product and avail-
 able from various vendors, must include a PATHWORKS IP (PWIP) driver.

 NetBEUI transport software is included with the PATHWORKS V5 for Open-
 VMS software. Using NetBEUI transport software, LAN Manager clients
 can access the server in the local area network for file and print ser-
 vices.

 See the Software Requirements section of this SPD for information on
 supported network transport software.

 NetBIOS[TM] Interface Support

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS supports the NetBIOS interface in DECnet, TCP
 /IP, and NetBEUI networks. PATHWORKS for OpenVMS utilizes NetBIOS nam-
 ing services and datagram services. A NetBIOS programming interface
 is not provided, however. NetBIOS interface support includes the sup-
 port of multiple transport stacks on a single or different network con-
 trollers. NetBIOS support under TCP/IP includes a b-node RFC 1001/1002
 implementation. This implies that the NetBIOS interface is supported
 under TCP/IP in local area network environments only.

 Flexible Security Models

 The PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS security model accommodates both the LAN
 Manager security model and the OpenVMS security model. The server may
 be configured to use the security implementation best suited to the
 environment. In "LAN Manager Only" mode, the LAN Manager security model
 is enforced. In "LAN Manager and OpenVMS" mode, both the OpenVMS and
 LAN Manager security models are enforced. In "LAN Manager and Creator"
 mode, OpenVMS security is applied to files not created by users of the
 PATHWORKS server.

 Domain Support

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS allows the network to be subdivided into ad-
 ministrative groups of servers and clients called domains. A domain
 is a group of servers and clients on a LAN and is the basic unit of
 network administration. Each server running PATHWORKS for OpenVMS can
 be a member of a single domain. A PATHWORKS for OpenVMS server can be

                                  4

 

 a Primary Domain Controller, Backup Domain Controller, Member Server,
 or a Standalone Server, depending on the environment. Domains are a
 convenient mechanism for controlling user access to the network, and
 for managing large networks.

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS also provides support for wide area domains
 using the LMHosts file. This file's presence on the PATHWORKS for Open-
 VMS (LAN Manager) server allows NET Logons and UAS replication over
 some wide area TCP/IP configurations. The LMHosts file contains a list
 of nodes from geographically disperse sites that are synchronized by
 the primary domain controller and accessible to clients in the server's
 domain. However, use of the LMHosts file for replication over extreme
 distances or in networks with slow transmission speeds is not recom-
 mended.

 Network Logon Services

 The domain capabilities of LAN Manager make it possible for a user to
 issue a single logon request in order to gain access to multiple servers
 in a LAN. Running the netlogon service forces the validation of users'
 logon requests. The logon server that processes the request checks its
 copy of the domain-wide user accounts database for the user name and
 password supplied in the logon request.

 LAN Manager V2.2 API Support

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS supports the LAN Manager V2.2 Application Pro-
 gramming Interfaces, with the exception of Named Pipes and Mailslots.
 Note that LAN Manager APIs are not available to OpenVMS host-based ap-
 plications, but are available to PATHWORKS LAN Manager-based clients,
 non-PATHWORKS LAN Manager clients, and OS/2 LAN Manager servers.

 Remote Boot

 The remote boot service included with PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS allows
 DOS and Windows workstations to start up using information stored on
 the server's hard disk instead of on their own local hard disks. The
 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS remote boot service is based on Microsoft's
 LAN Manager remote boot service, which uses the Remote Program Load

                                  5

 

 (RPL) protocol. Remote boot is supported over NetBEUI on Ethernet net-
 works. PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS supports MOP (Maintenance Operation
 Protocol) as a secondary loader for clients without an RPL ROM.

 Mail Services

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS includes a mail server component that allows
 clients to send and receive electronic mail. The mail server is based
 on the OpenVMS MAIL-11 product and requires DECnet as its communica-
 tions transport. It allows users of PATHWORKS Mail client software to
 send and receive electronic mail messages without having to log in to
 the OpenVMS system as an interactive user.

 A mail account may be established on the OpenVMS server for each user.
 Mail can be sent to this account by other PATHWORKS Mail users as well
 as traditional users of OpenVMS mail software. The mail server then
 routes messages to the appropriate client when the user logs onto the
 server.

 The PATHWORKS for OpenVMS mail server provides the PATHWORKS user with
 folders, distribution lists, and delivery capabilities. Realtime no-
 tification of new messages can be optionally enabled by the client.
 Time and Date Services

 DOS, Windows, and OS/2 clients can request date and time information
 from the server system and set the local workstation date and time to
 coincide with them.

 PATHWORKS FAT File System

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS includes the PATHWORKS FAT file system, which
 is an alternative to, and designed to coexist with the OpenVMS ODS-
 2 file system. It is based on the DOS File Allocation Table (FAT) file
 system. PC files stored in the FAT file system are stored in native
 DOS format in a container file on the server system. Features of the
 PATHWORKS FAT file system include:

 -  support for multiple readers and writers of the container file

 -  wide-area network access to files stored on the server in DOS for-
    mat

                                  6

 

 -  improved performance on file and directory operations over the Open-
    VMS ODS-2 file system

 The PATHWORKS FAT file system may be used as a migration path from ex-
 isting PATHWORKS V4.x disk service container files (see Accommodation
 of Retired Features).

 Server Management and Control

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS supports several server management interfaces:

 -  ManageWORKS, a Windows-based utility supplied with the PATHWORKS
    V5 for DOS and Windows client product

 -  A character cell utility called ADMINISTER/PATHWORKS

 -  The LAN Manager NET ADMIN command line interface which may be ac-
    cessed from a terminal or terminal emulator, or from a LAN Manager
    client, including the PATHWORKS for DOS and Windows client.

 The management utilities can be used to:

 o  Manage file and printer shares, user accounts, and groups

 o  Display and control server resources currently in use, such as ac-
    tive sessions, connections, services, and server statistics

 o  View context-sensitive Help for each menu item and command












                                  7

 

 PATHWORKS Monitor

 The PATHWORKS Monitor utility is a Windows-based application provided
 with the PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS server software. PATHWORKS Monitor
 collects data on server resource utilization and provides a real-time
 graphical display of this information.

 PATHWORKS Configurator

 The PATHWORKS Configurator utility is an OpenVMS-based application that
 allows the user to modify the server's configuration. For example, the
 user can configure the data cache size, the security mode, the num-
 ber of supported clients and more. Any adjustments that need to be made
 to the OpenVMS SYSGEN parameters are automatically performed by the
 Configurator utility.

 Enhanced Cluster Support

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS includes support for a transport-independent
 PATHWORKS cluster alias name service that allows multiple cluster mem-
 bers to appear as a single server to the connecting clients, provid-
 ing higher availability. The PATHWORKS cluster alias name has a load-
 balancing feature which connects clients to the cluster member that
 is the least loaded at the time of the connection. PATHWORKS V5 for
 OpenVMS also includes a high performance cluster-wide distributed data
 cache that provides scalability in a clustered environment. VAX clus-
 ters, Alpha clusters, and mixed-architecture clusters are supported
 by PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS.

 Enhanced Performance via XQP+

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS includes a special release of the enhanced
 OpenVMS file system, known as XQP+ (eXtended QIO Processor Plus). XQP+
 is separately installable to OpenVMS VAX V5.5-2. XQP+ is included with
 OpenVMS VAX and Alpha V6.1 and later. When PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS
 detects the existence of the enhanced file system, it automatically
 takes advantage of its improved concurrency, multi-threading, and di-
 rectory caching features to provide better performance to file sys-
 tem operations.

                                  8

 

 Installation Utilities

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS is installed on the OpenVMS system using the
 standard VMSINSTAL procedure. An Installation Verification Procedure
 (IVP) is also included, which can be used to confirm that the server
 software has been installed properly.

 The installation procedure allows you to install just the LAN Manager
 server, just the NetWare server or both. It also allows you to install
 just the PATHWORKS License Server.

 Digital recommends that a customer's first purchase of this software
 product at each site include Digital installation service. Contact your
 local Digital representative for information on the service options
 available.

 License Management

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS offers several license management capabil-
 ities related to both client-based and server-based licenses.

 -  Client-based License Management

 PATHWORKS client licenses are provided as Product Authorization Keys
 (PAKs) for the OpenVMS or Digital UNIX License Management Facility (LMF).
 These PAKs must be loaded into an LMF database, using standard LMF pro-
 cedures, on an OpenVMS or Digital UNIX system that is acting as a PATH-
 WORKS License Server. [1] A single copy of the PATHWORKS License Server
 software provides and verifies client-based licenses for clients us-
 ing either NetWare or LAN Manager software. NetWare clients use the
 IPX transport to communicate with a PATHWORKS License Server, while
 LAN Manager clients use the DECnet, TCP/IP, or NetBEUI transports.

 The PATHWORKS License Manager, which must execute on the same node as
 the License Server, provides a user interface that allows the system
 manager to monitor client license usage. The PATHWORKS License Man-
 ager is also used to pre-allocate licenses to specific groups of users
 and to reclaim a license from a client.

 The PATHWORKS License Registrar, which executes on the same system as
 the file server, verifies the licenses for clients requesting access
 to the server functions. Clients that can produce a valid client-based
 license are allowed access to the services offered by the PATHWORKS
 V5 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) server.

 -  Server-based License Management

 The PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) server also allows client
 access based on a local server-based license. If a client requesting
 access to the server fails to produce a valid client-based license,
 the PATHWORKS License Registrar software checks the local LMF database
 for the availability of a PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) FPS

 ____________________
 Note   that although the license server can be active on a single node
   in a cluster, if that node goes down for any reason, the license server
   will automatically activate itself on another node in the cluster that

   is still running PATHWORKS.

                                 10

 

 license. If one is available, and the number of concurrently-connected
 clients allowed by the license has not been exceeded, the client is
 allowed access.

 Note that PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) server allows you to
 use both client-based and server-based licenses, simultaneously. How-
 ever, since clients that have a valid client-based license are already
 licensed to use the server software, they are never counted against
 the fixed number of clients granted access by the server-based FPS li-
 cense.

 Accommodation of Retired Features

 The following features of PATHWORKS V4.x for OpenVMS are not provided
 in PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS:

 o  File services over LAST

 o  Disk services

 o  Remote boot over LAST

 If PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS is installed on a server system which had
 been running V4.x of the product, some aspects of the V4.x environ-
 ment related to the features listed above will be preserved. Disk ser-
 vices will remain intact and available to pre-V5 clients. LAST-based
 remote boot services will also remain intact and available to pre-V5
 clients.

 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
 The systems, components, and peripherals specified below are supported
 except as noted.

 Processors Supported

 All VAX and Alpha processors that are supported by the version of the
 OpenVMS operating system in use are also supported by PATHWORKS V5 for
 OpenVMS (LAN Manager) with the following exceptions:


                                 11

 


 MicroVAX  MicroVAX I, MicroVAX II, MicroVAX 2000

 VAXstation VAXstation I, VAXstation II, VAXstation 2000, VAXstation
           8000

 VAX       VAX-11/725, VAX-11/730, VAX 11/750, VAX 11/780, VAX 11
           /782, VAX 11/785

 Memory Requirements

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS requires the following minimum physical mem-
 ory for proper installation, configuration, and execution of the soft-
 ware:

    16 MBytes on VAX systems (24 MBytes if used with DECnet/OSI)

    64 MBytes on Alpha systems

 Note that the memory requirements indicated above are minimum require-
 ments only, and that memory requirements can vary widely according to
 the server CPU, the number of clients using the server and their ac-
 tivities, the number and speed of the server's disks and the other ap-
 plications running on the server.

 For example, a typical configuration supporting a light workload (word
 processing or spreadsheet applications) for 50 PC users requires an
 Alpha system with approximately 64 MB of memory or a VAX system with
 approximately 16 - 24 MB of memory. This assumes that 80% of the sys-
 tem memory and CPU time are dedicated to PATHWORKS, even though some
 work loads may use less.

    o  SPD 42.35.xx for DECnet for OpenVMS on Alpha systems

                                 15

 

    o  SPD 50.45.xx for DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS on Alpha systems

    o  SPD 48.48.xx for DECnet for OpenVMS on VAX systems

    o  SPD 25.03.xx for DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS on VAX systems

 o  For the NetBEUI transport, PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) pro-
    vides the same level of support for Ethernet and FDDI as the Open-
    VMS operating system. For OpenVMS VAX, see SPD 25.01.xx. For Open-
    VMS Alpha, see SPD 41.87.xx. PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager)
    does not support NetBEUI over Token Ring on VAX systems.

 The PATHWORKS for OpenVMS server does not support the DEFZA FDDI con-
 troller.

 CLUSTER ENVIRONMENT

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) supports all VMScluster con-
 figurations. VMScluster configurations for Alpha systems are fully de-
 scribed in the VMScluster Software for OpenVMS Alpha Software Prod-
 uct Description (SPD 42.18.xx). VAXcluster configurations are fully
 described in the VAXcluster Software for OpenVMS VAX Software Prod-
 uct Description (SPD 29.78.xx).

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) supports up to 31 server nodes
 in cluster. In other words, no more than 31 nodes in a cluster can run
 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) concurrently. In a typical sce-
 nario, the server is run on only a few central nodes, to exploit the
 cluster's shared disks and high speed interconnect environment.

 In a cluster, PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) supports simul-
 taneous file access by all nodes running the server. A central event
 log and central LAN Manager accounts and share databases are maintained
 in a cluster. In a LAN Manager domain, the VMScluster represents a sin-
 gle domain member, whether it is acting as the primary domain controller,
 the backup domain controller or a member server.

 When PATHWORKS for OpenVMS is to be used in a TCP/IP environment, OpenVMS-
 based TCP/IP software is required. This software must be purchased sep-
 arately. The following TCP/IP transports support PATHWORKS V5.0D for
 OpenVMS:

 o  Digital's TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS V4.0

 o  TGV's Multinet V3.5 rev A

 o  Process Software Corporation's TCPware for OpenVMS V5.0-4

 o  The Wollongong Group's PathWay V1.1

                                 18

 

 Other PATHWORKS Server Software

 PATHWORKS V5.0D for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) and PATHWORKS V1.0D for Open-
 VMS (NetWare) now share some common components. As a result, only cer-
 tain combinations of PATHWORKS server software can run on the same ma-
 chine at the same time.
 The following PATHWORKS server products can run on the same system as
 PATHWORKS V5.0D for OpenVMS (LAN Manager):

 o  PATHWORKS V1.x for OpenVMS (Macintosh)

 o  PATHWORKS V1.0D for OpenVMS (NetWare)

 The following PATHWORKS server products cannot run on the same sys-
 tem as PATHWORKS V5.0D for OpenVMS (LAN Manager):

 o  PATHWORKS V1.0 for OpenVMS (NetWare).
    If the V1.0 (NetWare) server is installed on a system to which the
    V5.0D (LAN Manager) server is added, the V1.0 (NetWare) server is
    automatically upgraded to the V1.0D (NetWare) server.

 o  PATHWORKS for OpenVMS V4.x.
    The V5.0D server can be installed and configured on a system run-
    ning the V4.x server, but actually running the V5.0D server on a
    system also running the V4.x server is not possible or supported.

 Client Software

 The following versions of client software are supported for use in con-
 junction with PATHWORKS for OpenVMS:

 o  PATHWORKS V6.0 for DOS and Windows (LAN Manager) (SPD 55.07.xx)

 o  PATHWORKS for OS/2[R] V5.1 (SPD 55.24.xx)

 o  LAN Manager V2.2 workstation software for DOS, Windows, and OS/2

 o  Microsoft Windows NT workstation software V3.1 or V3.5

 o  Microsoft Windows for Workgroups V3.11

                                 19

 

 o  Microsoft Windows 95

 The TCP/IP transport is included with the PATHWORKS V5 for DOS and Win-
 dows client. PATHWORKS for DOS V4.x clients operating in a TCP/IP en-
 vironment require the PATHWORKS for DOS (TCP/IP) V2.0 software.

 PATHWORKS for DOS and Windows clients that access the services of a
 PATHWORKS for OpenVMS server via remote methods require PATHWORKS Re-
 mote V5.0 or later.

 GROWTH CONSIDERATIONS

 The minimum hardware and software requirements for any future version
 of this product may be different from the requirements for the cur-
 rent version.

 DISTRIBUTION MEDIA

 o  CD-ROM

 SOFTWARE LICENSING

 PATHWORKS V5 for OpenVMS can be licensed in two different ways.

 o  Client-based licensing (CCS & FPA licenses)

 This product can be licensed for operation and access on any number
 of supported platforms to provide services to clients assigned appro-
 priate client-based licenses.

 See the attached PATHWORKS license terms and conditions for CCS (Sec-
 tion 1) and FPA (Section 2) licenses for a description of the specific
 rights granted. See below for applicable client license types and or-
 dering information.

 o  Server-based licensing (FPS)

 A PATHWORKS FPS license for this product permits its use on a single
 supported platform and allows access by clients that do not have a PATH-
 WORKS client-based license.

                                 20

 

 See the attached PATHWORKS License terms and conditions for FPS (Sec-
 tion 4) licenses for a description of the specific rights granted. See
 below for applicable ordering information.

 Note: Clients with client-based licenses for server access do not in-
 terfere with the access of other clients that rely on server-based li-
 censing for access to a particular server. The two licensing methods
 are designed to coexist.

 your exclusive remedy for Software which does not conform to DIGITAL's
 Limited Warranty shall be, at DIGITAL's option, either (1) repair or

 interrupted or error free.

 This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have
 other rights which vary from state to state. Some states do not al-
 low limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above
 limitation may not apply to you.
