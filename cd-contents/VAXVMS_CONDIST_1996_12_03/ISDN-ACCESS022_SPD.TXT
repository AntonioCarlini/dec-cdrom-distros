 PRODUCT NAME:  VAX ISDN ACCESS, Version 2.2            SPD 31.24.04

 DESCRIPTION

 VAX ISDN ACCESS allows suitably configured DECnet nodes in a DECnet
 network to remotely control connections to an ISDN network at a DEC-
 net node that is physically connected to the ISDN network running the
 VAX ISDN software. This type of node is called an ISDN connector node.

 The ISDN connector node is a DECnet node physically connected to a sup-
 ported ISDN network via a Basic Rate Access (DEC ISDNcontroller 100
 /DIV32) and running both VAX ISDN software and DECnet/OSI for Open-
 VMS VAX (formerly called DECnet-VAX) software.

 This node must be licensed for, and running the VAX ISDN software. Re-
 fer to the VAX ISDN Software Product Description (SPD 31.23.xx) as well
 as the DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS VAX Software Product Description (SPD
 25.03.xx).

 VAX ISDN ACCESS also provides the ability to establish and control ISDN
 connections by the use of OpenVMS DCL commands. Three new DCL commands
 are added to the DCL tables: ISDN CALL, ISDN CLEAR, and ISDN SHOW CALLS.

 Using these commands, any user may request the automatic establish-
 ment of an ISDN connection and clear it without having to know spe-
 cific parameters of the physical unit that will be used. Before hav-
 ing these commands fully operational on the OpenVMS VAX system, the
 system or network manager must configure some tables as described in
 the chapter "Call Management Software" of the Management Guide.

 INSTALLATION

 Digital recommends that a customer's first purchase of this software
 include Digital Installation Services. These services provide for in-
 stallation of the software product by an experienced Digital Software
 Specialist.

 Customer Responsibilities

 Before installation of the software, the customer must:

 o  Previously have installed all prerequisite software and hardware,
    including terminals.

 o  Deinstall any version of the VAX ISDN or VAX ISDN ACCESS software
    previously installed, using the deinstallation procedure provided
    with the kit.

    During installation, the appropriate kit (Phase IV or Phase V) is
    automatically selected from the VAX ISDN distribution media depend-
    ing on the DECnet version running on the system at that time. How-
    ever, if the system is upgraded with DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS VAX Ver-
    sion 5.5, the VAX ISDN kit will have to be re-installed.

 o  Make available for a reasonable period of time, as mutually agreed
    by Digital and the customer, all hardware, communication facili-
    ties, and terminals that are to be used during installation.
