 PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER Archive/Backup Version 2.0   SPD 48.16.04
                for OpenVMS

 DESCRIPTION

 Data center storage administrators face three major storage manage-
 ment problems: system backup and restore complexity, effective file
 archiving and retrieval, and lack of online data storage capacity. POLY-
 CENTER Archive/Backup for OpenVMS (PAB) helps the storage administra-
 tor solve these problems.

 PAB automates backups, provides for system archiving, and makes it easy
 to find files stored on tapes and disks. PAB also provides a client
 backup facility, and is therefore a major component in a "lights out"
 data center environment.

 PAB Version 2.0 now expands these capabilities to include support of
 selected UNIX clients.

 Features

 PAB provides the following important file archiving and backup capa-
 bilities:

 o  Automatic, flexible scheduling of backup and archive operations for
    OpenVMS and selected UNIX platforms.

 o  Support for client backup and archiving operations directly between
    disks and tape drives located on different systems using DECnet[TM]
    network protocol for OpenVMS Clients, and TCP/IP protocol for sup-
    ported UNIX Clients, without staging data on disks.

                                                           July 1996

                                                         AE-QHD6E-TE

 

 o  Online maintenance of information about backed up and archived files,
    disk volumes and databases. This allows for quickly retrieving files
    or restoring disk volumes without the having to know the names of
    the tape volumes on which the data was saved.

 o  Graphical user interface (GUI) that simplifies managing archive and
    backup policies, and finding files, volumes, and databases that have
    been backed up or archived.

 o  Integration with POLYCENTER DECscheduler for advanced and complex
    scheduling of backup and archive operations.

 o  Easily installed and configured, with an out-of-the-box default con-
    figuration.

 o  Layers upon a robust and fully tested media manager called Media
    Device Management Software (MDMS). MDMS was developed from an ex-
    isting archive and backup tool with additional robot manager util-
    ities added to its functionality.

    Through MDMS, PAB provides the following important media and de-
    vice management capabilities:

    -  Good error recovery and reporting capability.

    -  Support for OpenVMS VAX [TM] Version 6.1 and 6.2 software.

    -  Support for OpenVMS Alpha [TM] Version 6.1 and 6.2 software.

    -  Integration with RMU/BACKUP and RMU/RESTORE, allowing backup and
       restore operations of Oracle Rdb[TM] databases using MDMS man-
       aged media.

    -  Effective use of all media capacity by appending multiple save
       sets of backed up or archived files to the same volume or vol-
       ume set.

    -  Direct positioning to the start of each save set file during a
       restore operation using saved information about the tape posi-
       tion of each save set file.

    -  Customization features to meet a variety of operational and site
       requirements.

                                  2

 

    -  Support for unattended backup operations using the TL810/812 and
       TL820/822/826 family of automatic tape cartridge loaders, and
       the RV64 optical jukebox; optional support for the StorageTek[R]
       automated cartridge server.

    -  Support for Tx8n7 and Tx8n5 automatic tape cartridge loaders as
       direct slot robotic devices.

    -  Media life cycle control including maintenance of volume reten-
       tion period, availability status, location, and scheduling dates
       when volumes are to move offsite and return.

    -  Maintenance of counters for each volume noting the number of times
       a volume has been mounted and the number of errors associated
       with the volume. These counters are used to schedule volume clean-
       ing when the counters exceed setable threshold values.

    -  Media allocation control based on customer-defined media pools.

    -  Ability to print external tape labels in a customizable format.

    -  Built-in report generation and custom report generation capa-
       bility.

    -  Security features to prevent unauthorized media or device use.

    -  Round-robin device allocation to distribute drive usage among
       available tape drives.

    -  In a VMScluster[TM] environment, automatic failure recovery from
       the loss of a processor to allow continuous access to the MDMS
       media databases.

 o  Integration with the Remote Device Facility (RDF[TM]).

    The RDF software is distributed within MDMS software and is option-
    ally installed during the MDMS software installation procedure. RDF
    allows MDMS to access a tape or RV60-type optical disks from other
    OpenVMS nodes across the DECnet[TM] network for PAB backup and archive
    operations.

    The MDMS software makes access to remote tape drives transparent
    to PAB backup and archive operations by issuing RDF commands as ap-

                                  3

 

    propriate if a designated tape drive is considered remote. MDMS soft-
    ware also manages volume load requests to remote systems to allow
    unattended backups or to communicate with a console operator. MDMS
    makes no direct use of the remote disk capabilities within RDF.

    RDF includes the following components:

    -  RDF servers that execute tape I/O requests on behalf of a re-
       mote client. Servers are located on systems that have tape drives
       attached or that can access drives through the OpenVMS TMSCP[TM]
       server.

    -  RDF clients that provide the communications interface between
       applications reading or writing data to a tape drive and the RDF
       servers.

 LICENSE OPTIONS

 To support a variety of configuration requirements, the following PAB
 for OpenVMS license options are available:

 o  PAB for OpenVMS VAX or Alpha, SERVER-Included with the respective
    SLS Manager for OpenVMS VAX or Alpha Library Manager kit and uses
    the same license

 o  PAB for OpenVMS VAX or Alpha, CLIENT- Included with the SLS Man-
    ager REMOTE for OpenVMS VAX or Alpha kit and license

 o  PAB for OpenVMS ACS-Included with the SLS ACS for OpenVMS VAX or
    Alpha kit and license (for connection to StorageTek silos)

 o  PAB UNIX, CLIENT-This is a separately purchased option that allows
    you to add UNIX client nodes to your PAB operational environment.

 PAB for OpenVMS, SERVER

 PAB for OpenVMS Server software provides full functionality, as pre-
 viously described, to the nodes or VMScluster on which PAB is execut-
 ing. A node or VMScluster executing PAB for OpenVMS Server software
 provides backup policy management services for itself and for any Open-
 VMS or appropriate UNIX client nodes connected to it. At least one PAB

                                  4

 

 for OpenVMS Server license in the network is required for use of the
 PAB for OpenVMS product.

 PAB for OpenVMS SERVER software manages the catalogs that record in-
 formation about user files backed up or archived under PAB control at
 the local node.

 PAB for OpenVMS, CLIENT

 PAB for OpenVMS Client software provides backup and archiving oper-
 ations for the OpenVMS node or VMScluster on which it is executing,
 and it acts as a client of another node executing PAB for OpenVMS Server
 software when it requires policy information.

 PAB UNIX CLIENT

 A PAB UNIX Client license allows backup scheduling and archiving ser-
 vices for the UNIX client node configured within the PAB policy en-
 vironment.

 An OpenVMS node, VMScluster, or a UNIX client node executing PAB for
 OpenVMS software communicates with another OpenVMS node or VMSclus-
 ter executing PAB for OpenVMS Server software. This provides users with
 the full functionality as previously described.

 The OpenVMS node executing PAB for OpenVMS Client software communi-
 cates using DECnet software to a server node running PAB for OpenVMS
 SERVER software. The server node maintains the PAB policy database that
 contains information about PAB policy objects.

 Each PAB for OpenVMS client node must be connected to a node execut-
 ing the PAB for OpenVMS Server software. Any number of PAB for Open-
 VMS client nodes may be connected to a single PAB for OpenVMS server
 node.

 Like PAB for OpenVMS Server software, PAB for OpenVMS Client software
 maintains PAB catalogs where it records information about user files,
 disk volumes, or Oracle Rdb databases backed up or archived locally
 under its control.

 PAB ACS for OpenVMS

                                  5

 

 PAB ACS for OpenVMS supports the StorageTek 4400 automated cartridge
 server. This license is required in order to interface the StorageTek
 ACS to PAB for OpenVMS software.

 The PAB for OpenVMS ACS license is loaded in the system together with
 either the PAB for OpenVMS Server or PAB for OpenVMS Client licenses.

 Disk Space Required for Media Database and Catalogs

 The MDMS media database should be places only on nodes executing PAB
 for OpenVMS SERVER software (that is, not on nodes executing PAB for
 OpenVMS CLIENT software).

 The disk space required by the PAB for OpenVMS media database depends
 on the number of pieces of media to be managed. During installation,
 the storage administrator may designate the disk on which the MDMS me-
 dia database is to be kept. For enhanced data safety, the MDMS media
 database may be stored on a shadowed disk.

 PAB for OpenVMS catalog files are present on any node executing ei-
 ther PAB for OpenVMS SERVER software or PAB for OpenVMS CLIENT soft-
 ware. The disk space required by a PAB catalogs depends on the num-
 ber of files to be tracked by PAB for OpenVMS software.

 Required Disk Space-PAB for OpenVMS SERVER Software

 Executing the PAB for OpenVMS software requires approximately 42,000
 blocks (the number of blocks occupied by PAB for OpenVMS SERVER), plus
 one block for every piece of media it manages. Each instance of sav-
 ing a file requires less space in the catalog. For example, the first
 five times a file is saved, it requires approximately .73 blocks per
 file. If the file is save 20 times, it requires approximately .45 blocks
 per file.

 Disk Space Required-PAB for OpenVMS CLIENT and PAB for OpenVMS ACS Soft-
 ware

 Execution of PAB for OpenVMS CLIENT software requires approximately
 20,000 blocks (the number of blocks occupied by PAB for OpenVMS CLIENT
 software). Each instance of saving a file requires less space in the
 catalog. For example, the first five times a file is saved, it requires
 approximately .73 blocks per file. If the file is save 20 times, it
 requires approximately .45 blocks per file.
