compilers that aid in the detailed program design phase of software
development.

DECset for OpenVMS VAX Systems Components

DEC Language-Sensitive Editor/Source Code Analyzer for OpenVMS VAX Sys-
tems:

Language-Sensitive Editor

The Language-Sensitive Editor (LSE) is a multilanguage programmer's
editor. Language-specific templates and online language help assist
both new and experienced programmers in developing programs faster.
With LSE, users can efficiently edit, compile, review diagnostic in-
formation from compilations, and correct compile time errors without
exiting the editor. LSE also enables users to customize and extend their
editing environment.

Programmers can perform low-level program designs with LSE by embed-
ding pseudocode in source code. Users can also view source code at var-
ious levels of detail by replacing a sequence of source lines with a
single overview line.

LSE provides an interface via callable routines, as well as through
the LSE command-line interface and the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS
VAX interface.

The following VAX compilers fully support LSE; the language templates
are included with LSE:

   DEC Ada
   DEC BASIC
   DEC C
   DEC C++
   VAX COBOL
   DEC Fortran
   DEC PASCAL
   VAX BLISS-32
   VAX C
   VAX MACRO

                                 2

 

   VAX PL/1

The following VAX products partially support LSE (refer to product SPDs
for more details); the templates are included with the product:

   VAX ACMS
   VAX DATATRIEVE

Note: Certain LSE features are not available when using language pre-
processors, such as those supplied for Oracle Rdb.

LSE works in concert with CMS, SCA, and the VAX Debugger to provide
a highly interactive, online environment that facilitates the NAVIGATE-
EDIT-COMPILE-DEBUG portion of the program development cycle. DECset
users can directly reserve and replace files from CMS while in LSE,
go to the exact source code location in LSE from the SCA, and go to
the exact source code location in LSE from the VAX Debugger.

Source Code Analyzer

The Source Code Analyzer (SCA) aids programmers in understanding the
complexities of software systems. Since it allows users to analyze an
entire system, as opposed to individual modules, and helps users un-
derstand unfamiliar systems, SCA is extremely useful during both the
implementation and maintenance phases of a project.

SCA provides navigation capabilities to assist users in locating and
viewing components of their source code. SCA accomplishes this by stor-
ing compiler-generated information about a set of source files in an
SCA library. SCA then allows users to perform queries about their source
code in the following ways:

o  Using a name browser to locate all items that match a search string.

o  Specifying a cross-reference query to find how and where program
   symbols are used.

o  Specifying a call graph query to graphically display call relation-
   ships between routines.

                                 3

 

o  Specifying a data structure query to graphically display the struc-
   ture of data types in the source code or to find symbols of a given
   type.

After users have a query result, they can use the go-to-source fea-
ture to navigate to locations of interest in their source code.

SCA also provides static analysis capabilities to assist users in check-
ing consistent use of program symbols.

SCA provides an interface via callable routines, as well as through
the SCA command-line interface and the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS
VAX interface. The following VAX compilers generate information to pop-
ulate an SCA library:

   DEC Ada
   DEC BASIC
   DEC C
   VAX COBOL
   DEC Fortran
   DEC PASCAL
   VAX BLISS-32
   VAX MACRO
   VAX PL/1

Note: SCA is not available when using language preprocessors, such as
those supplied for Oracle Rdb.

The following VAX compilers also generate pseudocode and specialized
comment processing information so SCA can produce design reports, cross-
reference and analysis information:

   DEC Ada
   DEC BASIC
   DEC C
   VAX COBOL
   DEC Fortran
   DEC PASCAL
   VAX BLISS-32

                                 4

DEC Language-Sensitive Editor/Source Code Analyzer for OpenVMS VAX Sys-
tems is a component of the DECset for OpenVMS VAX Systems product and
is also available separately. Please refer to the ORDERING INFORMA-
TION section of this SPD.

DEC Test Manager for OpenVMS VAX Systems

The DEC Test Manager for OpenVMS VAX Systems is a regression testing
tool that automates the creation and maintenance of regression tests.
It also automatically compares test run results with expected test re-
sults. The DEC Test Manager provides users with flexibility in orga-
nizing tests, selecting tests for execution, and verifying and review-
ing test results. With the DEC Test Manager users can:

o  Test batch and command-line applications.

o  Test interactive applications that input and output text to character-
   cell terminals (DEC and ANSI CRT) with single display plane.

o  Create and record tests.

o  Group tests into meaningful combinations.

o  Execute specific tests, groups of tests, or combinations of groups
   of tests.

o  Compare the results of the executed tests with benchmark test re-
   sults to determine differences.

o  View test results interactively.

o  Update benchmarks as needed.

o  Filter test results to ignore output that is expected to change for
   each test execution.

The DEC Test Manager enables users to store software test descriptions
and related files in CMS libraries for storage efficiency.

                                 5

 

The DEC Test Manager provides an interface through callable routines,
as well as through the DEC Test Manager command-line interface and the
DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS VAX interface.

The DEC Test Manager for OpenVMS VAX Systems is a component of the DEC-
set for OpenVMS VAX Systems product and is also available separately.
Please refer to the ORDERING INFORMATION section of this SPD.

DEC Performance and Coverage Analyzer for OpenVMS VAX Systems

The DEC Performance and Coverage Analyzer (PCA) for OpenVMS VAX Sys-
tems helps users pinpoint execution bottlenecks in application pro-
grams. PCA can also identify which parts of an application are not ex-
ecuted by a given set of test data. PCA has two components: the Col-
lector, which gathers performance or test coverage data on the run-
ning user program; and the Analyzer, which later processes and dis-
plays the collected data. The Analyzer graphically presents informa-
tion in four types of charts: histograms, tables, annotated source list-
ings, and call trees.

PCA does not analyze operating system performance or aid in hardware
resource planning.

PCA can gather and report on the following types of performance data:

o  Call stacks

o  CPU sampling data

o  Event markers

o  PC sampling data

o  Page fault data

o  System services data

o  Input/Output data

o  Exact execution counts

o  Test coverage data

                                 6

 

o  Ada tasking data

Additional PCA features include the following:

o  Traversing commands to sift through performance data

o  Screen mode to display different types of data in separate windows

o  Multiple data kinds allowing the display of different categories
   of performance data in the same histogram or table

o  Acceptable noncoverage indicating portions of code that are accept-
   ably noncovered to the Analyzer

o  Filtering to analyze only a subset of data

With PCA, users can analyze applications written in any of the fol-
lowing OpenVMS languages:

   DEC Ada
   DEC BASIC
   DEC C
   VAX COBOL
   DEC Fortran
   DEC PASCAL
   VAX BLISS-32
   VAX PL/1

PCA works in concert with LSE and the DEC Test Manager. From the character-
cell version of PCA, users can communicate with LSE and can examine
source code. When used with the DEC Test Manager, PCA can evaluate the
code coverage of a user's test system.

PCA provides a command-line interface and the DECwindows Motif for Open-
VMS VAX interface.

DEC Performance and Coverage Analyzer for OpenVMS VAX Systems is a com-
ponent of the DECset for OpenVMS VAX Systems product and is also avail-
able separately. Please refer to the ORDERING INFORMATION section of
this SPD.

DEC Code Management System for OpenVMS VAX Systems

                                 7

 

The DEC Code Management System (CMS) for OpenVMS VAX Systems provides
an efficient method for storing project files and tracking all changes
to those files. Code management is especially important to projects
that have long life spans or several versions of the software.

CMS stores any kind of RMS file, including documents; plans; speci-
fications; status reports; source code files; object files; executable
images; sixel files; or other records, and keeps these files in project
libraries. CMS also stores history information. As a project evolves,
CMS tracks changes to the library by storing only the changes made to
a file. Not only does this reduce the amount of disk space used for
storing multiple versions of files, but it also allows CMS to recon-
struct any previous version of a file and to identify the changes made
between any two versions. In addition to storing successive changes,
CMS maintains a record of who is currently working on a library el-
ement and a historical record of library access.

With CMS, users can:

o  Support multiple project libraries.

o  Retrieve previous generations (versions).

o  Delete, purge, or collapse generations.

o  Obtain a report of file modifications, including when, why, and by
   whom the modification was made.

o  Determine the origin of each line of a file, either as an annotated
   listing or as comments in the file.

o  Manage concurrent modifications.

o  Merge separately developed modifications.

o  Combine related files together as a class (group).

o  Relate the generation of one element to the corresponding gener-
   ations of other elements for purposes of freezing baselines or re-
   leases and for organizing ongoing development.

o  Interface via callable routines, as well as through the CMS command-
   line interface and the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS VAX interface.

                                 8

 

o  Through the use of CMS access control lists, fine tune security mech-
   anisms applied to CMS libraries, and provide a means of notifica-
   tion about library events.

CMS can act as a project's central repository, by storing and track-
ing source-code files, object code, documentation, and a variety of
files generated by other tools. CMS can store files for MMS and the
DEC Test Manager. LSE and DEC Test Manager users can access CMS el-
ements directly from within LSE and DEC Test Manager.

The DEC Code Management System provides an interface through callable
routines, as well as through the command-line interface and the DECwin-
dows Motif for OpenVMS VAX interface.

DEC Code Management System for OpenVMS VAX Systems is a component of
the DECset for OpenVMS VAX Systems product and is also available sep-
arately. Please refer to the ORDERING INFORMATION section of this SPD.

DEC Module Management System for OpenVMS VAX Systems:

DEC Module Management System (MMS) for OpenVMS VAX Systems automates
and simplifies the building of software applications, whether they are
simple programs of only one or two files or complex programs consist-
ing of many source files, message files, and documentation. MMS can
optimize the build process by rebuilding only those components (and
their dependencies) in a system that have changed since the system was
last built. In this way, MMS eliminates the steps of recompiling and
linking modules that have not changed. MMS can automatically gener-
ate description files. Once users create a description file contain-
ing the rules describing the relationships among the components of their
application and the MMS commands to build the application, MMS can build
both small or large systems with a single command.

MMS provides a command-line interface and the DECwindows Motif for Open-
VMS VAX interface.

DEC Module Management System for OpenVMS VAX Systems is a component
of the DECset for OpenVMS VAX Systems product and is also available
separately. Please refer to the ORDERING INFORMATION section of this
SPD.
