          PRODUCT NAME:  DECram Version 2.2 for OpenVMS[*]       SPD 34.26.04

          DESCRIPTION

          DECram Version 2.2 for OpenVMS supports both the OpenVMS for Alpha and
          OpenVMS for VAX platforms.

          DECram for OpenVMS is a disk device driver that allows an OpenVMS sys-
          tem manager to create pseudo disks (RAMdisks) that reside in main mem-
          ory for the purpose of improving I/O performance. Frequently accessed
          data can be accessed much faster from a DECram device than from a 
	  physical disk device. These RAMdisks can be accessed through the file 
          system just as physical disks are accessed, requiring no change to 
	  the application or the system software.

          The number of DECram units used is quite small, usually one but of-
          ten two or more.

          Because main memory is allocated for the DECram device, a substantial
          amount of extra memory is generally required. The amount of memory 
	  dedicated can be selected. The OpenVMS system manager designates the 
          amount of memory dedicated to the DECram device(s) and the files 
          that will be stored on it.

          Cluster Environment

          DECram Version 2.2 for OpenVMS is fully supported when installed on
          any valid and licensed VAX or Alpha system and in a VAXcluster, VM-
          Scluster or Mixed Architecture Cluster (MAC) configuration without re-
          strictions. DECram devices can be served by mass storage control pro-
          tocol, MSCP, and by members of a shadow set. There are no special hard-
          ware requirements to install DECram Version 2.2.

          User Interface

          The user interface to a DECram device is the same as other disk class
          devices. Note that the response to a SHOW DEVICE /FULL command will
          indicate "device type unknown" in current OpenVMS releases. The de-
          vice type DT$_RAM_DISK is not known by the SHOW DEVICE command in cur-
          rent OpenVMS releases.

          Management Interface

          A DECram device is managed using the same tools used to manage any 
          other OpenVMS supported disk, that is, SYSGEN, INITIALIZE, MOUNT, 
          and so on. However, the standard utilities are used differently to 
          set up a DECram device.

          System Analysis

          Before creating a DECram device, the OpenVMS system manager must de-
          termine its size. Each disk block allocated to a DECram device will
          mean one less page of available memory. The system manager should also
          assess the need for multiple DECram units.

          System Generation

          The OpenVMS system manager must reassess the values for the SYSGEN pa-
          rameters that control paging and swapping behavior.

          Restrictions

          DECram Version 2.2 for OpenVMS currently has the following restric-
          tions:

          o  Data in a DECram device is volatile

          o  DECram device size cannot exceed 524 280 blocks

          DECram for OpenVMS will not support long-term data storage because 
          data in a DECram device is volatile. If a system or hardware failure 
          occurs, data stored in the DECram device is lost and must be 
          re-created.
