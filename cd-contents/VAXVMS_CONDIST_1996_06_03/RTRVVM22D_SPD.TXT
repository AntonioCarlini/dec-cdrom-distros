PRODUCT NAME:  Reliable Transaction Router Version 2.2D  SPD 34.30.07  
               for OpenVMS VAX

DESCRIPTION

Reliable Transaction Router Version 2.2D for OpenVMS VAX can be li-
censed for either full function operation or to work only as a client.
It is a reliable, transparent message routing system that includes both
a transactional and a nontransactional message control system. Reli-
able Transaction Router implements automatic software fault tolerance
and failure recovery on the OpenVMS operating system by adapting to
hardware (CPU), communications, and application software failures. Re-
liable Transaction Router provides users with the ability to easily
partition multiple application programs over DECnet local area net-
works (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs). Ease of development fea-
tures include both a Requester (Client)/Server design environment, with
optional all-or-nothing transaction semantics, as well as a message
broadcasting capability. Reliable Transaction Router implements vir-
tual, rather than physical networks, which provide the application de-
veloper with a "single view" of a distributed client/server environ-
ment. This technique allows the application software to be indepen-
dent of physical hardware (CPU) location, network naming conventions,
and communications protocol.

Reliable Transaction Router Version 2.2D for OpenVMS VAX is fully com-
patible and interoperable with Reliable Transaction Router Version 2.2D
for OpenVMS Alpha. Reliable Transaction Router Version 2.2D applica-
tions developed on OpenVMS VAX can be recompiled for execution on Open-
VMS Alpha. Reliable Transaction Router Version 2.2D applications can
be deployed in networks and VMScluster systems containing a combina-
tion of Alpha and VAX nodes. Reliable Transaction Router Version 2.2D

                                                       January 1996

for OpenVMS VAX is also backward compatible with previous Version 2.x
releases of Reliable Transaction Router for OpenVMS VAX (note: this
does not apply to monitoring of remote nodes).

Reliable Transaction Router is implemented by providing the program-
mer with eight system services to develop distributed applications.
This call interface conforms to the OpenVMS calling standard. The Reliable
Transaction Router call interface functions are also made available
at the Digital Command Language (DCL) level in both their synchronous
and asynchronous forms.

Reliable Transaction Router provides application software fault tol-
erant features such as shadow-server processing, standby-server pro-
cessing, and call-out servers to implement user authentication con-
trol, as well as concurrent servers with dynamic message load balanc-
ing for high performance. The high performance transactional messag-
ing is implemented as a full-duplex, conversational remote procedure
call (RPC) using real-time flow control techniques. These features gen-
erally require no special user application programming logic.

The System Management interface allows the dynamic creation, deletion,
modification, and monitoring of multiple, independent virtual networks
within a network. In addition, the monitoring utility can be invoked
from any system, with suitable privileges, to gather and report dis-
tributed application performance statistics. The Reliable Transaction
Router System Management interface is used to bind the physical hard-
ware (CPU and communications) to a virtual network namespace and is
completely transparent to the application software. Several levels of
physical and logical security can be controlled via the System Man-
agement interface. Additional security is provided at runtime through
the Reliable Transaction Router call interface.

Reliable Transaction Router is both forms/window management systems
and database independent. Application server features allow transaction-
consistent access to Digital and non-Digital database products within
the same networkwide distributed transaction.

Reliable Transaction Router is primarily intended for production sys-
tems in large distributed environments that require frontend forms in-
dependence and backend server database independence (e.g., trading/money
dealing systems, telecommunications systems, and so forth). Reliable
Transaction Router can also be used in general distributed systems that
require reliable messaging and fault tolerant application control over
LANs and/or WANs. Reliable Transaction Router provides the enabling
technology for applications requiring fully distributed client/server
models rather than a distributed database model.

Full Function Features

o  Provides transparent, content-based transaction routing for client
   /server applications in a distributed system.

o  Provides nontransaction based routing (broadcasts) for up to 32 sub-
   scription domains within a virtual network. Subscription is based
   on alphanumeric names within a flexible addressing scheme that in-
   cludes wildcarding.

o  Allows user-defined partitioned data models (content-based rout-
   ing) for improved performance of user applications in a LAN and/or
   WAN.

o  Acts as a layer between the application requesters and servers thus
   decoupling the end-to-end relationship normally required by user
   application control. This provides the application developer with
   a "single" system view of the programming environment over multi-
   ple hardware systems located on a LAN and/or WAN.

o  Ensures atomicity of transactions (all or nothing) by using a two-
   phase commit protocol to guarantee conversational message deliv-
   ery among one or more application servers.

o  Offers at-most-once semantics for valid transactions. This includes
   specially flagged transaction replay to a surviving application server,
   or a later instantiation of that server on the same or a differ-
   ent machine on the virtual network. In addition, DECdtm support is
   provided for use with resource managers supported by DECdtm. When

                                 3

 

   the DECdtm option is invoked by the application program, the ap-
   plication programmer is not required to be aware of transaction re-
   plays, since Reliable Transaction Router coordinates this directly
   through DECdtm and the participating resource managers.

o  Provides disaster protection and recovery (e.g., site failure) au-
   tomatically by mirroring transactions in shadow-server environments.

o  Supports multiple (concurrent) servers as well as multithreaded re-
   questers and/or servers.

o  Maintains near-linear performance scaling over a wide range of con-
   figurations allowing easy horizontal expansion of both hardware sys-
   tems and application software.

o  Enables transparent and automatic failover/failback of application
   servers on multiple backend systems within a VAXcluster while re-
   maining transparent to application requesters executing on remote
   frontend system(s). Reliable Transaction Router can maintain ap-
   plication operation in many instances of single or multiple fail-
   ure modes in a widely distributed software/hardware configuration.

o  Includes system management utilities for online monitoring and sys-
   tem control of virtual networks from any workstation or terminal
   with the appropriate privileges. This feature includes the moni-
   toring of statistics, software and hardware states, requesters/servers,
   and system manager control of distributed Reliable Transaction Router
   applications.

o  Provides a synchronous as well as asynchronous DCL interface to all
   Reliable Transaction Router system services. This feature is in-
   tended to facilitate application prototyping and debugging.

o  Uses DECnet as the underlying transport for the virtual network.

o  Supports the connection of a number of remote client products with
   the remote client handler feature. These remote client products im-
   plement a subset of the Reliable Transaction Router architecture.
   Connection to these types of clients is available using DECnet and
   /or TCP/IP. The remote client handler acts as a gateway between the
   remote client application and the application server on the vir-
   tual network.

Client Features

o  Provides the necessary environment to run Reliable Transaction Router
   client applications under OpenVMS as part of an Reliable Transac-
   tion Router virtual network.

o  Supports full automatic failover to another router in the event of
   a communications link failure.

o  Supports all OpenVMS calling methods (asynchronous and synchronous)
   and DCL interfaces.

o  Supports transactional and nontransactional (broadcast) messages.

o  Supports all Reliable Transaction Router system management oper-
   ations.

o  Uses DECnet as the underlying transport for the virtual network.

o  Supports the remote client handler for DECnet and TCP/IP connec-
   tions.
