           PRODUCT NAME:  VAX KCT32, Version 2.1        SPD 26.04.04

           DESCRIPTION

           VAX KCT32 is a software and firmware package that provides
           users with VMS support for the KCT32 hardware communication
           option. VAX KCT32 software, in conjunction with the KCT32
           firmware and KCT32 hardware, allows users to implement cus-
           tom communication applications.

           Users can program the KCT32 communication lines for bit/byte
           synchronous or asynchronous transmission and reception us-
           ing the standard Digital PDP-11 Instruction Set, as imple-
           mented with the DCT11 chip. This software used with the KCT32
           hardware and user-written communication application allows
           the VMS host processor to perform high speed (two lines at
           64K baud in bit synchronous mode, or one line at 130K baud
           in bit synchronous mode) multi-line communication functions.

           Software Features

           o  VMS General Purpose driver which allows the VMS host ap-
              plication to pass command, control, and message data to
              /from the:

              -  VMS user

              -  KCT32 user-written communication application

              -  Remote end of the communication lines

           o  Down-line loading of the KCT32 user-developed communi-
              cation application

           o  KCT32 status and statistics

           o  Full-duplex Driver operation

           o  UETP (User Environment Test Program)

           o  IVP (Installation Verification Program) for the KCT32 VMS
              driver

           o  Integrated support of the UETP, IVP, and level 2R diag-
              nostic in the VMS driver

           The driver is full-duplex, maintains internal queues and will
           support up to four KCT32s concurrently.

           Firmware Features

           The KCT32 firmware consists of system support modules where
           users can build and debug custom communication applications.

           The support modules consist of:

           o  KCT32 executive for control of modules and application
              interfaces.

           o  Modem control interface.

           o  Baud rate generator interface.

           o  CSR interface.

           o  Timer functions.

           o  KCT32 front-end I/O processor interface. (The KCT32 has
              a second onboard microprocessor for dedicated control of
              the communication lines.)

           o  KCT32 ODT type, Debugger Interface for debugging user ap-
              plications.

           o  DMA interfaces for high throughput to/from the KCT32 VAX
              host and to/from the KCT32 and its onboard I/O proces-
              sor.

           o  Onboard selectable interface for RS422, RS449, RS423, or
              RS232.
