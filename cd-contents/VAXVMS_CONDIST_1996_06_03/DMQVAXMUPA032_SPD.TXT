         PRODUCT NAME: DECmessageQ for OpenVMS,              SPD 46.25.04

                       Version 3.2

         DESCRIPTION

         DECmessageQ for OpenVMS is the OpenVMS (VAX and Alpha) operating sys-
         tem implementation of a generic software message queuing bus that
         provides easy-to-use, efficient task-to-task communications among
         processes using DECmessageQ on OpenVMS, ULTRIX, MS-DOS/2[R], 
         Macintosh[R], HP[R]-UX, AIX[R], 88open[R], and Digital UNIX[R], 
         Windows NT[TM] (Alpha and Intel[R]), and SunOS[R] and Solaris[R].

         A common call interface allows messages to be delivered via high-
         speed global sections for some intra-CPU applications, or via DECnet-
         VMS and Transmission Control Protocol/INTERNET Protocol (TCP/IP) for
         inter-CPU applications. Applications can be designed so client ap-
         plications can be redeployed easily anywhere within the DECmessageQ
         network configuration, whether in a standalone node, a Local Area
         Network (LAN), or a Wide Area Network (WAN).

         The DECmessageQ communication implementation is designed for ease-
         of-use, expandability, and efficiency.

         DECmessageQ for OpenVMS can also be used as an integration tool to
         merge many external events with the Message Queuing Bus. In addi-
         tion to integrating messages from local processes and remote pro-
         cesses, DECmessageQ also provides facilities for the integration of
         other events such as:

         o  Timer settings

         o  Simulated messages

         o  LU6.2 conversations

         DECmessageQ Queues

         DECmessageQ for OpenVMS provides three types of queues. A queue is
         a memory storage location for DECmessageQ messages. Any process can
         insert a message into any queue. These queues are accessed directly
         by DECmessageQ procedures. These procedures are called by user-written
         applications. DECmessageQ queue types are:

         o  Primary Queue (PQ) - Each process that attaches to the message
            queuing bus is assigned a Primary Queue. This queue is used to
            receive messages from processes using DECmessageQ.

         o  Secondary Queue (SQ) - Any process may attach to one or more sec-
            ondary queues. These queues can also be used to receive messages.
            The order in which queues are scanned for messages is defined by
            the DECmessageQ selection rules.

         o  Multi-Reader Queue (MRQ) - A Multi-Reader Queue is a single shared
            queue that can be shared by multiple processes.

         Message Recovery Services (MRS)

         Message Recovery Services for the DECmessageQ Message Queuing Bus
         extend data recovery to the level of pending messages. Using Message
         Recovery Services, the sender is relieved of the responsibility of
         tracking the progress of a message through its next level of pro-
         cessing. This functionality can be used both at the client and server
         sides of the application.

         Message Recovery Services increase the robustness of DECmessageQ by
         providing applications with the ability to recover from message de-
         livery failures due to:

         o  Application program abort

         o  Communication line failure

         o  System crash

         Some of the applications requirements addressed by MRS are:

         o  Sender wishes to insure delivery of messages when the receiving
            process is available but does not wish to monitor the delivery.

         o  Sender wishes to know that a message is recoverable to avoid the
            cost of reconstructing it but does not care when it is finally
            delivered.

         Version 3.2

         o  Receiver wishes to maintain a journal of all messages received
            by it for audit trail or reprocessing.

         Message Recovery Services are primarily implemented by an MRS server,
         a non-privileged program attached to the DECmessageQ Message Bus.
         MRS actions are invoked by standard DECmessageQ send and receive mes-
         sage calls.

         MRS is oriented toward messages, not processes; not all messages sent
         from or directed to a particular process need to be processed by MRS.
         This allows applications to selectively incur the additional pro-
         cessing imposed by MRS for just those messages that are not easily
         recovered. Message recovery characteristics are set by the sending
         process.

         Exchange of recoverable messages with non-OpenVMS systems requires
         a minimum of DECmessageQ V3.0A.

         Selective Broadcast Services (SBS)

         There are two important application requirements handled by this ser-
         vice. The first requirement is the ability to send a message to many
         targets without going through multiple application DECmessageQ send
         message requests. The second requirement is the ability to gener-
         ate broadcast messages without the originator knowing the quantity
         or location of the target process(es).

         Selective Broadcast Services provide a conceptual broadcast stream
         of data. In this broadcast stream any process can insert a message.
         Any process can select messages from this broadcast stream for de-
         livery. Messages may be selected using a set of rules that provide
         relational comparisons against DECmessageQ header information or user's
         message data information. The Selective Broadcast Services operate
         in a single server environment or between cooperating DECmessageQ
         servers. When the SBS is operating between nodes, it can operate us-
         ing DECnet or TCP/IP services, or using direct Ethernet operations.
         In the direct Ethernet operations, the SBS will optimize message traf-
         fic by using Ethernet's multi-casting capabilities.

         Delivery Options

         DECmessageQ for OpenVMS provides the following set of delivery op-
         tions:

         o  Datagram - A non-recoverable attempt is made to deliver a mes-
            sage. If the message cannot be delivered to a target, then an er-
            ror is logged.

         Version 3.2

         o  Blocking and non-blocking enqueue - The sending process will be
            notified when the message is written to the target queue. A re-
            turn status will indicate if the message successfully enqueued
            to the queue.

         o  Blocking and non-blocking dequeue - The sending process will be
            notified when the message is read from the target queue. A re-
            turn status will indicate if the message successfully dequeued
            from the queue.

         o  Blocking and non-blocking Acknowledge - The sending process will
            be notified when the target process confirms the message. A re-
            turn status will indicate if the message was successfully con-
            firmed by the target.

         o  Blocking and non-blocking Recoverable - The sending process will
            be notified when the recovery system has accepted the message.
            A return status will indicate if the message was successfully jour-
            nalled by the recovery system.

         o  Blocking and non-blocking Recoverable Acknowledge - The sending
            process will be notified when the target process has confirmed
            the recoverable message. A return status will indicate if the mes-
            sage was successfully confirmed by the target process.

         DECmessageQ Scripts Facility

         The DECmessageQ scripts facility provides a general capability to
         perform message capture, simulation, and replay.

         o  Capture - DECmessageQ scripts can be used to capture messages sent
            or received from a process. These messages can be displayed on
            the output device or collected in a disk file. The messages are
            displayed in an ASCII file using the DECmessageQ scripts syntax.

         o  Simulation - A disk file containing DECmessageQ scripts commands
            can be used to simulate message traffic to a process. The com-
            mands use the DECmessageQ scripts syntax. The process will re-
            ceive these messages after any DECmessageQ queue is scanned for
            receivable messages.

         o  Replay - A replay is the simulation of messages previously cap-
            tured.

         Version 3.2

         DECmessageQ LU6.2 Services for OpenVMS systems allows user programs
         attached to a DECmessageQ Message Queuing Bus to request, accept,
         and conduct APPC (Advanced Program-to-Program Communications) con-
         versations with programs running under CICS/VS, IMS/VS, and other
         IBM[R] environments over SNA LU6.2 sessions.

           Refer to the DECnet/SNA APPC/LU6.2 Programming Interface for
           OpenVMS Software Product Description (SPD 26.88.xx) for cur-
           rently supported environments.

           ___________________________________________________________

         DECmessageQ LU6.2 Services allows users unfamiliar with SNA commu-
         nications to develop, quickly and easily, applications that oper-
         ate with IBM-based APPC applications. Users are insulated from the
         details of both SNA and APPC. DECmessageQ provides additional in-
         sulation between the two environments by translating transaction pro-
         gram names known to DECmessageQ user programs to names known to the
         IBM system(s) and vice versa.

         DECmessageQ LU6.2 Services for OpenVMS consists of:

         o  An LU6.2 Server image ("Port Server") that provides connection
            management facilities, isolating the end user from details of SNA-
            APPC communications

         o  A library of predefined DECmessageQ message structures for ease
            of program development

         o  Utilities for managing the LU6.2 Server

         o  Tools for developing user-written LU6.2 Servers

         DECmessageQ LU6.2 Services Limits

         DECmessageQ LU6.2 Services for OpenVMS has the following limits:

         Maximum user message  31,982 bytes

         DECmessageQ LU6.2 Services Utilities

         DECmessageQ LU6.2 Services for OpenVMS includes a management util-
         ity that allows a suitably privileged user to start, stop, and con-
         figure DECmessageQ LU6.2 servers and observe their activity (through
         an event monitoring facility).

         Users can develop specialized LU6.2 servers by using the DECmessageQ
         LU6.2 Server tool kit. The tool kit consists of a DECmessageQ for
         OpenVMS User Callback (a "user callback" is a special User Exit mod-
         ule) and 21 predefined DECmessageQ message structures.

         The LU6.2 Server tool kit gives the user a finer degree of control
         over the APPC environment than the standard DECmessageQ LU6.2 Server.
         Functions supported via the tool kit are:

         o  DEFINE_LU

         o  DEFINE_TP

         o  DELETE_LU
