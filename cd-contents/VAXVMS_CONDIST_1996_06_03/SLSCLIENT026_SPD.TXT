 

 DESCRIPTION

 Data center managers face three storage management problems: system
 backup and restore complexity, effective file archiving and retrieval,
 and lack of online data storage capacity. The Storage Library System
 (SLS) for OpenVMS helps the storage administrator solve these prob-
 lems.

 SLS for OpenVMS manages tape volumes through the volume life cycle,
 automates backups, provides for system and user archiving, and makes
 it easy to find files stored on tapes. SLS for OpenVMS also provides
 a remote backup facility, and is therefore a major component in "lights
 out" data center operations.

 Key Features

 SLS for OpenVMS provides the following important file archiving and
 backup capabilities:

 o  Automatic, flexible scheduling of backup operations

 o  Centralized services for user-requested backup and archiving op-
    erations

 o  Support for remote backup and archiving operations directly between
    disks and tape drives located on different systems within a DEC-
    net network without staging data across disks

 o  Online maintenance of information about backed up and archived files
    and volumes; this allows quick retrieval of the files or restora-
    tion of disk volumes without the user having to know the names of
    the tape volumes on which the data was saved

 o  Support for OpenVMS on VAX (Versions 5.5-2 through 6.2) and Alpha
    (Version 6.1 and 6.2) systems in both mixed-interconnect and mixed
    architecture VMSclusters

 o  Integration with RMU/BACKUP and RMU/RESTORE, allowing backup and
    restore of Oracle Rdb[TM] databases using SLS managed media

 o  Effective use of all media capacity by appending multiple sets of
    backed up or archived files to the same volume or volume set

                               DIGITAL                  October 1995

                                                         AE-LB73N-TE

 

 o  Direct positioning to the start of each save set file during a re-
    store operation using saved information about the tape position of
    each save set file

 o  DCL and menu interfaces with online help for users, operators, and
    storage administrators

 o  Customization features to meet a variety of operational and site
    requirements

 SLS for OpenVMS provides the following important media and device man-
 agement capabilities:

 o  Support for unattended backup operations using a variety of auto-
    mated loaders, such as TA90, TA90E, Tx8n7, TL820, the RV64 opti-
    cal jukebox, the StorageTek[R] automated cartridge server (Wolfcreek
    silo); for a complete list, see the device support tables at the
    end of this document.

 o  Support for Tx8n7 and Tx8n5 automatic tape cartridge loaders as ei-
    ther direct slot robotic devices or as gravity loaders (stackers)

 o  Media life cycle control including maintenance of volume retention
    period, availability status, location, and scheduling of dates when
    volumes are to move offsite and return

 o  Maintenance of counters for each volume noting the number of times
    a volume has been mounted and the number of errors associated with
    the volume; these counters are used to schedule volume cleaning when
    the counters exceed threshold values

 o  Control of media allocation based on customer-defined media pools

 o  Ability to print external tape labels in a customizable format

 o  Built-in report generation and custom report generation capabil-
    ity

 o  Security features to prevent unauthorized media or device use

 o  "Round robin" device allocation to distribute drive usage among avail-
    able tape drives

                                  2

 

 o  In a VMScluster environment, automatic failure recovery from the
    loss of a processor to allow continuous access to the SLS for Open-
    VMS media databases

 Supported Media and Devices

 SLS for OpenVMS software manages the media and devices for all OpenVMS-
 supported reel-to-reel and cartridge tape drives, the RV20 write-once
 optical disk drive, and the RV64 optical disk jukebox.

 For a comprehensive list of devices SLS supports, see the device ta-
 bles at the end of this document.

 Remote Device Facility (RDF[TM])

 The Remote Device Facility (RDF) software is distributed within the
 SLS for OpenVMS software. It is optionally installed during the SLS
 software installation procedure. No additional license is needed for
 RDF, when used within the bounds of SLS.

 RDF allows SLS to access a tape or RV60-type optical disks from other
 OpenVMS nodes across the DECnet network for backup and archive oper-
 ations. RDF includes of the following components:

 o  RDF servers that execute tape I/O requests on behalf of a remote
    client. Servers are located on systems that have tape drives at-
    tached or on systems that can access drives through the OpenVMS TM-
    SCP Server.

 o  RDF clients that provide the communications interface between ap-
    plications reading or writing data to a tape drive and to the RDF
    servers.

 SLS for OpenVMS software makes access to remote tape drives transpar-
 ent to SLS backup and archive operations by issuing RDF commands as
 appropriate if a designated tape drive is a remote one. SLS for Open-
 VMS software also manages volume load requests to remote systems to
 allow unattended backups or to communicate with a console operator.
 SLS for OpenVMS makes no direct use of the remote disk capabilities
 inherent in RDF.

 OPTIONS

 To support a variety of configuration requirements, six SLS for Open
 VMS license options are available:

    SLS for OpenVMS VAX
    SLS for OpenVMS Alpha
    SLS for OpenVMS VAX REMOTE
    SLS for OpenVMS Alpha REMOTE
    SLS for OpenVMS VAX ACS
    SLS for OpenVMS Alpha ACS

 SLS for OpenVMS VAX and SLS for OpenVMS Alpha

 SLS for OpenVMS software provides full functionality, as described above,
 to users on the node or VMScluster on which SLS is executing. A node
 or VMScluster executing SLS for OpenVMS software provides media man-
 agement services for itself and for any "client nodes" connected to
 it. At least one SLS for OpenVMS license in the network is required
 for use of the SLS for OpenVMS product.

 SLS for OpenVMS software manages the following:

 o  The "SLS for OpenVMS volume database," an RMS file which describes
    all removable storage media (volumes) known to SLS for OpenVMS soft-
    ware.

 o  "SLS for OpenVMS history files" in which information about user files
    backed up or archived under SLS for OpenVMS control at the local
    node is recorded.

 o  The "SLS for OpenVMS magazine database," an RMS file which describes
    all magazines (Tx8n7, TL820) and the cartridges contained in them.

 SLS for OpenVMS VAX REMOTE and SLS for OpenVMS Alpha REMOTE

 SLS for OpenVMS REMOTE software provides backup scheduling and archiv-
 ing services for the node or VMScluster on which it is executing, and
 acts as a client of another node executing SLS for OpenVMS software
 when it requires media management services.

                                  4

 

 A node or VMScluster executing SLS for OpenVMS REMOTE software in com-
 munication with another node or VMScluster executing SLS for OpenVMS
 software provides users with the full functionality described above.

 Like SLS for OpenVMS software, SLS for OpenVMS REMOTE software main-
 tains "SLS for OpenVMS history files" in which it records information
 about user files backed up or archived locally under its control. The
 node executing SLS for OpenVMS REMOTE software communicates using DEC-
 net software to a "server node" running SLS software. The "server node"
 maintains the SLS for OpenVMS media database. The SLS for OpenVMS me-
 dia database contains information about volume location and pool ac-
 cess authorization.

 Each SLS for OpenVMS REMOTE node must be connected to a server node
 executing SLS software for media management services. Any number of
 SLS for OpenVMS REMOTE nodes may be connected to a single SLS for Open-
 VMS node.

 SLS for OpenVMS VAX ACS and SLS for OpenVMS Alpha ACS

 SLS for OpenVMS ACS supports the StorageTek 4400 automated cartridge
 server. This license is required in order to interface the StorageTek
 ACS to SLS for OpenVMS.

 The SLS ACS license is loaded in the system together with either the
 SLS or SLS REMOTE licenses.

 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

 Disk space required by the SLS for OpenVMS media database and history
 files:

 The SLS for OpenVMS media database is present only on nodes execut-
 ing SLS for OpenVMS software (i.e., not on nodes executing SLS for Open-
 VMS REMOTE software). The disk space required by the SLS for OpenVMS
 media database depends on the number of pieces of media to be managed.
 During installation, the storage administrator may designate the disk
 on which the SLS for OpenVMS media database is to be kept. For enhanced

                                  7

 

 data safety, the SLS for OpenVMS media database may be stored on a shad-
 owed disk.

 SLS for OpenVMS history files are present on any node executing ei-
 ther SLS for OpenVMS software or SLS for OpenVMS REMOTE software. The
 disk space required by a SLS history file depends on the number of files
 to be tracked by SLS for OpenVMS software. During installation, the
 storage administrator may designate the disk on which SLS for Open-
 VMS history files are to be kept. For enhanced data safety, the SLS
 for OpenVMS history files may be stored on a shadowed disk.

 Total Disk Space Requirement for SLS for OpenVMS Software:

 Execution of SLS for OpenVMS software requires approximately 8,400 blocks
 (the number of blocks occupied by SLS for OpenVMS and RDF software)
 plus one block for every piece of media it manages plus one block for
 every six files it tracks.

 Example: Assume that there are 1,500 pieces of media under management
 by SLS for OpenVMS software and that 60,000 files are tracked. The space
 required is:

 SLS for       8,400 blocks
 OpenVMS
 software:

 Media         1,500 blocks
