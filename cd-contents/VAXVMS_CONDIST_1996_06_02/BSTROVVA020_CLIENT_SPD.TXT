PRODUCT NAME:   BASEstar Open Client                   SPD 47.80.01
                Version 2.0

DESCRIPTION

BASEstar Open software facilitates the integration of manufacturing
applications and plant equipment. Accelerated development of integrated
manufacturing systems is assured through an architecture that also en-
courages consistency of application development.

BASEstar Open takes advantage of the client/server computing archi-
tecture. While the server software library supplies all supported ser-
vices, the client software library allows client applications to ac-
cess the same services from any network Node on which BASEstar Client
is installed. Client and server communications within BASEstar Open
are provided through TCP/IP network communications.

For a description of the BASEstar Open Server product, refer to SPD
47.87.01.

The BASEstar Open Client allows applications to have transparent ac-
cess to BASEstar Open objects regardless of their physical location
in the distributed BASEstar Open environment. The Application Program-
ming Interface provided allows applications to:

o  Define, reference, and access Data_Point objects

o  Define, reference, notify, subscribe, and receive event objects

o  Define, reference, and exchange Packet data objects

o  Access the Application Management Services[1]

Features

The following features are those that a BASEstar Open Client can re-
quest from a BASEstar Open Server:

Application Integration

o  Data Management

   BASEstar Open Data Services provide a standard mechanism for defin-
   ing, organizing, and accessing data in a distributed manufactur-
   ing environment from a variety of sources including plant devices
   and area, plant, and work cell applications.

   BASEstar Open defines discrete data elements (Data_Points) to man-
   age manufacturing information. Data_Point definitions can be of var-
   ious types, ranging from scalar data elements to user-defined data
   structures. This maximizes the flexibility of data definition and
   acquisition.

   Since each Data_Point is referenced by name, applications become
   independent of their data sources and, consequently, do not require
   alteration as data sources change. In addition, simple Data_Points
   can have a predefined value specified at startup time. Data Ser-
   vices allow applications to define and manage datapoints.

   Each Data_Point can be associated with one or more Triggers. A Trig-
   ger defines a relationship between a Data_Point, a filter, and an
   event. Each time the value of a triggered Data_Point changes, as-
   sociated filter expressions are evaluated. Whenever the Boolean re-
   sult of an evaluated filter expression is TRUE, the associated Event
   is declared.

   One or more versions of a Data_Point value can be stored. In ad-
   dition to the value, each Data_Point version includes the time when
   the Data_Point value changed and its status at that time.

____________________
 For  BASEstar Open Client on PC, the Configuration Management Services

  are only available via the API, and are subject to limitations.

                                 2

 

   A new version is generated each time the value of a Data_Point changes.
   A user can request the current version, and thus the current value,
   or alternatively the value associated with any cached version.

o  Event Services

   BASEstar Open Event Services allow users to subscribe to one or more
   Events. Events are occurrences that are of interest to an appli-
   cation program-threshold exceeding, alarms, job completion, and so
   on. Users define the occurrence of such Events and specify the con-
   text information that should be passed. This context information
   can also include data and their types.

   To be notified of the occurrence of a specific Event, the appli-
   cation must issue a subscription to the Event.

   When an Event is declared, Event Services create and deliver the
   notifications that can be received by subscribers. A single Event
   declaration can generate many notifications on a one-to-many re-
   lationship, depending on the number of active subscriptions.

o  Packet Services

   BASEstar Open Packet Services allow users to directly exchange Pack-
   ets of information. Two users can establish direct communication
   through a Port to be used to send a Packet, and to which a user can
   connect to receive it.

   A Packet contains a description of information that must be exchanged.
   Each Packet input and output parameter is described by a datatype.

   BASEstar Open delivers a Packet to a Port in a protocol-independent
   manner and also independent of the location of the users and Ports
   involved.

o  Application Services[1]

   BASEstar Open Application Services provide all the functions re-
   quired to manage and coordinate manufacturing applications. These
   applications may be standalone or distributed across the Nodes of
   a network.

                                 3

 

   Application Services allow users to organize application activi-
   ties into hierarchical structures that support the execution startup
   and shutdown of synchronized activities, and user-defined error re-
   covery policies.

   An application Activity can be executed, suspended, resumed, and
   terminated. All Activity states are monitored. If an Activity (or
   Node) fails, several recovery policies can be applied. For instance,
   in case of Node failure, an application can be restarted on an al-
   ternative Node.

o  Application Development Support[1]

   To assist in developing applications, especially when debugging or
   troubleshooting, a Source Trace Tool is provided. This tool is used
   internally by BASEstar Open and is also available to users for mon-
   itoring the execution flow of an application.

   Trace facilities can be dynamically enabled or disabled by spec-
   ifying different granularity levels; it is not required that the
   user stops and restarts the tracing process. The output of the trace
   tool can be routed to several kinds of output devices-memory, files,
   terminals, and so on.

Configuration Management[2]

o  Named Objects

   The BASEstar Open environment is a collection of named objects which
   represent plant devices and Data_Points-alarms, data status, pro-
   duction counts, and so on. Manufacturing applications can there-
   fore access these resources using meaningful functional names, rather
   than in a system-dependent manner which would require, for instance,
   information on physical locations.

   BASEstar Open objects reside in Domains. Domains are hierarchically
   linked to form a BASEstar Open Realm. Several Realms can be active
   at the same time.


                                 4

 

o  Local and Remote Objects Access

   BASEstar Open objects can be directly accessed within a Realm by
   using the object's full pathname. The full pathname includes the
   local name preceded by the relevant Domain names. Alternatively,
   the user can set the default Domain and access objects in that Do-
   main using local names, and objects in lower Domains using partial
   pathnames.

o  System Configuration and Tuning

   BASEstar Open software provides command procedures that can be used
   to tune object configurations. A system manager can use the sug-
   gested values as guidelines in setting parameter values to opti-
   mize the usage of system resources.

o  Logging

   In addition to error and diagnostic information, BASEstar Open al-
   lows the logging of significant Events. For instance, the creation
   of an object definition.

BASEstar Open Interfaces

The BASEstar Open Client provides the following interface:

o  Application Programming Interface (API)

   The BASEstar Open Client API provides callable services for cre-
   ating new applications and integrating existing manufacturing ap-
   plications.

o  Graphic Configuration Utility (GCU)[1]

   The Graphic Configuration Utility can be accessed via the BASEs-
   tar Open Client interface. It is a graphical tool intended for con-
   figuring objects in the Permanent Object Database (PODB). Depend-
   ing on the operating system, it is:

   -  VMS DECwindows Motif-based on OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha

   -  OSF/Motif-based on OSF/1 AXP

Development and Runtime Versions

                                 5

 

Users who intend to develop BASEstar Open applications will need the
BASEstar Open development version. This will allow C language programs
containing BASEstar Open API calls to be compiled and linked with the
BASEstar Open libraries. Users who already have available a compiled
and linked BASEstar Open application only need a runtime version of
BASEstar Open.
