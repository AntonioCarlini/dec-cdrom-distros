         PRODUCT NAME: ObjectBroker for OpenVMS, Version 2.5          SPD

         44.12.02

         DESCRIPTION

         ObjectBroker for OpenVMS (VAX and Alpha) Version 2.5 provides ap-
         plication developers and system integrators with the development tools
         and run-time environments to integrate applications and services dis-
         tributed across UNIX[R] environments (Digital UNIX [TM]), ULTRIX,
         SunOS[TM], Solaris[TM], HP-UX[R], IBM[R] AIX[R]), Microsoft[R], OS/2[R],
         Windows[TM], Macintosh[R], and Windows NT[TM] (Alpha and Intel[TM]).

         ObjectBroker Version 2.5 is Digital's compliant implementation of
         the Object Management Group's (OMG[R]) Common Object Request Broker
         Architecture (CORBA[TM]) V1.2 specification.

         ObjectBroker simplifies distributed application development by pro-
         viding platform-independent, client/server, programming interfaces.
         It offers an object-oriented (O-O) approach to dynamic linking of
         independently developed applications and services. ObjectBroker al-
         lows application processes to transparently invoke, control, and in-
         teract with each other across multiple platforms.

         Features

         o  A single high-level, standards-based application programming in-
            terface (API) across 20 platforms.

         o  Compliant with OMG's CORBA V1.2 specification, protecting users'
            software development investments.

         o  OLE Integration (known as OLE Portal) and DDE Integration (known
            as DDE Listener) provides shrink-wrapped and custom desktop ap-
            plications that comply with the Microsoft OLE and DDE interfaces.
            Developers can use the OLE Portal and DDE Listener features to-
            day to begin moving toward open client/server environments.

                                                             January 1996

         ObjectBroker for OpenVMS, Version 2.5              SPD 44.12.02


         o  Script Servers allow client access to existing applications us-
            ing command line interfaces, with no source changes necessary,
            facilitating the migration to client/server computing.

         o  O-O abstraction provides insulation of clients and servers from
            changes in network topology or application code through the use
            of implementation-independent brokering services.

         ObjectBroker for OpenVMS, Version 2.5 Capabilities

         o  Interface Definition Language (IDL) for describing classes and
            messages

         o  Support for User Defined Types (UDT)

         o  Generation of client-side stubs for operations defined on one or
            more interfaces:

            -  Static interfaces use code skeletons (stubs) containing rou-
               tines that cannot be changed. Stubs provide a linear inter-
               face and reduce the complexity of the method resolution.

            -  Dynamic interfaces use routines that the client defines and
               builds as it is running. The dynamic interface provides client
               with more flexibility to use deferred synchronous operations,
               different method maps, and new interfaces.

         o  Generation of IDL skeletons (dispatchers), registration routines,
            and method routine stubs for servers

         o  Support for the Dynamic Invocation Interface (DII) routines

         Interface Repository

         The interface repository is a storage container for the definitions
         of interfaces, operations, and attributes which a client can use to
         make requests of the Object Request Broker (ORB). The interface repos-
         itory can also contain method maps, which describe the criteria by
         which to select implementations. The interface definitions in the
         Interface Repository are written in CORBA IDL, which is described
         in the CORBA V1.2 specification and in ObjectBroker documentation.

         Context Object

         ObjectBroker for OpenVMS, Version 2.5              SPD 44.12.02


         A context object contains information about a user's preferences which
         are taken into account during the resolution process, and about prop-
         erty values, which are propagated to the server-side during an in-
         vocation request. In addition, applications can store profile in-
         formation in the context object that is not used as resolution cri-
         teria.

         Agent

         The agent is the entity provided as part of ObjectBroker V2.5 which
         performs services on behalf of a user in the context of ObjectBroker.
         An agent must be present on any host which will be supporting ap-
         plications which are providing services using ObjectBroker.

         Script Server

         The Script Server is a special ObjectBroker server process which al-
         lows legacy applications to be encapsulated as object implementa-
         tions. The Script Server allows applications which export a command
         line interface to be used as object implementations. Client appli-
         cations have no knowledge that an object's implementation is actu-
         ally implemented as a script.

         Security Registry

         The Security Registry contains information about a user's authoriza-
         tion to access specific implementations (method servers) and meth-
         ods. The implementations and methods referenced by the Security Registry
         must be implementations and methods which are registered in the Implementation
         Registry. Information about the Agent is the only exception to this
         policy. This is because the Agent and its methods are entities which
         are well known to the ORB.

         A user's authorization information is maintained in the form of an
         Access Control List (ACL). This list contains the information about
         what methods of an implementation a user is allowed to access. Therefore,
         in order for a user to start a server, the user must have access to
         the StartServer method of the Agent; this is the default. Failure
         to have this access restricts a user from starting any new servers.

         Along with authorization information for users, the Security Registry
         also contains information which describes the list of remote users
         that are allowed to access ObjectBroker on the current host. This
         information allows system administrators to specify a mapping be-
         tween a user on a remote host and a local user account. This allows
         for remote users to access server applications on the local hosts
         which are not available to the general populous.

         Advertisement Registry

         Advertisements are the primary source of information to both a client
         application and the ORB Core. A client application can retrieve ini-
         tial objects from the advertisement registry.

         ObjectBroker's advertisement registry stores information about a server,
         where to find them, and what they provide. Advertisements are cre-
         ated when an implementation is installed somewhere on the network.
         The generated advertisement can be distributed at any time to re-
         mote advertisement registries.

         Implementation Registry

         The implementation registry contains information about object im-
         plementations which have been installed on this host. At a minimum,
         the implementation registry contains the unique identifier of the
         implementation, the operating system specific command for starting
         the server process which contains the implementation code, and the
         list of attributes which are defined as environment variables when
         the process that will execute the implementation is started.

         Configuration Registry

         The configuration registry contains information about the config-
         uration of ObjectBroker on a given node. Configuration information
         stored in the configuration registry includes the list of available
         transports, the authentication package to be used, and the location
         of files that contain the various implementations for the transport,
         security, and repository replaceable components. The configuration
         registry includes the list of locations for shared resources such
         as context objects, advertisements, and repositories.

         Digital Extensions to the CORBA specification provide enhanced
         capabilities. These extensions include:

         Languages

         o  The Implementation Language (IML) describes methods and method
            servers that constitute the implementation of an object.

         o  The Method Mapping Language (MML) maps operations to the meth-
            ods that implement them.

         ObjectBroker Utility Graphical User Interface provides a new, fully
         supported, windowed set of utilities that help system integrators
         manage the CORBA environment and programmers develop new distributed
         applications. The utility provides interfaces that:

         o  View and manipulate context objects, repositories, and remote servers

         o  Generate code for programmers

         o  Set up the environment (security, proxies, transport)

         The user interface of each utility is based on CORBA concepts. The
         utility's interface is native to the platform on which it is exe-
         cuting (Motif[R], Windows, Macintosh).

         OLE and DDE

         ObjectBroker Version 2.5 works cooperatively with Microsoft's Object
         Linking and Embedding (OLE) to provide a network "portal" from Microsoft
         Windows platforms to ObjectBroker server platforms. ObjectBroker ap-
         plications on UNIX and OpenVMS systems can be made OLE-aware (by im-
         plementing a set of predefined OLE methods shipped with ObjectBroker)
         and will respond to requests from OLE applications on Microsoft Windows.

         ObjectBroker for OpenVMS, Version 2.5              SPD 44.12.02


         The ObjectBroker-OLE portal processes OLE API calls on the PC and
         maps them to messages. These messages are then sent to an appropri-
         ate ObjectBroker server on the network for resolution. From a user's
         perspective, the mapping process is transparent. Within an OLE ap-
         plication, the OLE Network Portal appears as another local OLE server
         application, which can be expanded to a window to display OLE-aware
         applications/servers on the network. Information from sources across
         the network can be linked or embedded into desktop applications through
         ObjectBroker. The ObjectBroker OLE portal employs OLE Version 2.0
         interfaces and also provides support for OLE Version 1.0 applica-
         tions.

         ObjectBroker extends the Microsoft Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) com-
         munications protocol to allow Microsoft Windows applications on a
         networked PC to interact using DDE with applications running on Solaris,
         SunOS, IBM AIX, HP-UX, ULTRIX, OpenVMS and Digital UNIX. Applications
         can function as DDE clients or servers. DDE support in ObjectBroker
         allows two Microsoft applications to communicate on different PCs.

         Transports

         ObjectBroker supports PATHWORKS TCP/IP, Novell[R] TCP/IP and PATHWORKS
         DECnet IV network transports. In addition, ObjectBroker uses the Winsocket
         Version 1.1.1 interface to PATHWORKS TCP/IP and Novell TCP/IP and
         may work with other Winsocket-compliant TCP/IP transports implemen-
         tations. However, no others have been tested nor are they supported
         at this time.

         Multiple Simultaneous Transports

         ObjectBroker V2.5 supports multiple network transports on a single
         system; each transport can run concurrently on the system. A client
         running TCP/IP and DECnet can communicate with a server that is run-
         ning either TCP/IP, DECnet, or both. The system administrator con-
         trols which transports are available to client and server applica-
         tions on each system. The platforms that support multiple simulta-
         neous transports are OpenVMS systems, Macintosh, Microsoft Windows,
         and Windows NT (Intel and Alpha).

         Network Test Tool

         The network test tool provides the ability to determine whether the
         network is properly configured for use with ObjectBroker. A user can
         specify the target host to test against and the amount of data to
         be sent. This tool also provides detailed error messages when fail-
         ures occur.

         Installations

         New installations on all platforms provide the installer with a sim-
         plified installation.

         Interoperability

         ObjectBroker V2.5 supports the use of the ACA Services Version 2.1,
         ACAS_ routines, and ObjectBroker Version 2.5 CORBA routines. Installation
         of the Objectbroker Version 2.5 and ACA 2.1 compatibility bits must
         be on the same system.

         The CORBA routines are supported on all platforms. The ACA routines
         are supported on platforms released with ACA V2.1, but not on new
         platforms released with ObjectBroker V2.5 such as Windows NT.

         The installation procedure allows the installation of the ObjectBroker
         software and the ACA compatibility software. Installation of the com-
         patibility software is optional. Applications which use the ACAS_
         routines can continue to communicate with applications using the ACA
         Services V2.1 release, but will not be able to communicate with ap-
         plications using the CORBA_routines.

         New features in ObjectBroker V2.5 will not be available from the ACAS_
         routines. Applications which were written against the ORB_ routines
         provided in the ACA Services V2.1 release will need to be migrated
         to the CORBA routines provided in the ObjectBroker V2.5 release. This
         migration will require code modifications, recompilation, and re-
         linking.
