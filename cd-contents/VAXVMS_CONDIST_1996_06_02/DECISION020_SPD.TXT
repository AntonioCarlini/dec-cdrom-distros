           PRODUCT NAME:  DECdecision, Version 2.0                SPD 25.G2.03

           DESCRIPTION

           DECdecision is a product of Touch Technologies, Inc. and licensed un-
           der Digital Equipment Corporation's Standard Terms and Conditions.

           DECdecision is an OpenVMS, workstation-based, decision support appli-
           cation that runs under the DECwindows Desktop Environment.

           DECdecision is comprised of four major software components: Query for
           ad-hoc database queries, Calc for analyzing financial and business data,
           Chart for generating business graphs, and Builder for recording and
           automating repetitive tasks across components.

           DECdecision runs under the DECwindows Motif[R] for OpenVMS environ-
           ment and incorporates its common appearance and operation for pull-
           down menus, dialog boxes, windows, component cut/paste operations, and
           mouse pointing device support. Therefore, DECdecision has a consis-
           tent appearance across the entire product, shared with other appli-
           cation tool set (such as DECwrite) written under DECwindows.

           Features

           DECchart (Graphics)

           Chart is DECdecision's integrated charting component that works di-
           rectly with data from Calc, Query, and external (DECgraph, ASCII, and
           Lotus[R] WK1, WK3) source files. Chart has a Chartbook that presents
           the user with a sequence of predefined charts that can be further cus-
           tomized through legends, grids, titles, etc. Chart offers a wide va-
           riety of 45 chart styles based on the following basic graphics styles:
           Line, Area, Bar, Column, Histogram, Pie, Scatter, High-Low-Close, and
           Combination charts.

           Chart is comprised of:

           o  Graphic annotation - overlay: text, lines, rectangles, and arrow-
              heads anywhere on a chart for emphasis and customization.

           o  Color on-screen support - assign color attributes to: axis, base-
              line, frame, grids, legend, tags, tick marks, column and bar fills,
              and overlay objects.

           o  Easy modification of chart attributes including: axis, baseline,
              data values, frame, grids, legend, tags, tick marks, drop shadows,
              bar spacing, and bar overlap.

           o  File flexibility: save data, chart style, chart overlay, and color
              selections separately or save everything together.

           o  Selectable fill patterns, line patterns, marker types, and color
              attributes.

           o  Easy modification of text attributes - change: font size, family,
              weight, and slant.

           Builder is the cross-application tape recorder of DECdecision. Use Builder
           to record, store, and play back a series of frequently repeated op-
           erations.

           Builder is designed for users familiar with Calc, Query, and DECchart.
           In addition to recording the commands of the DECdecision components,
           users can also add the following to Builder blueprints:

           o  User Tools - other applications (for example, Mail) or command pro-
              cedures that users define for use within a blueprint

           o  External Blueprints - previously recorded and saved blueprints that
              users use within another blueprint

           o  Variables - words or symbols that can take on different values dur-
              ing playback

           o  Flow Control Tools:

              -  Loops - allow users to play back an external blueprint or user
                 tool multiple times

              -  Decisions - allow parts of a blueprint to play back condition-
                 ally, based on a user-defined expression (if-then-else) involv-
                 ing variables

           Users can use Builder in the following ways:

           o  Automatic record mode - to record your actions in a blueprint. Use
              automatic record to record regularly performed tasks that involve
              multiple DECdecision components.

           o  Playback mode - to run a previously recorded blueprint. Users can
              replay a blueprint in interactive or background mode.

           o  Splice mode - to use automatic record and playback modes simulta-
              neously. Users can replay a recorded blueprint, pause the playback,
              then modify the blueprint using automatic record.

           o  Manual edit - to manipulate blueprint objects or blueprint commands
              directly. While manually editing, users can add user tools, loops,
              decisions, external blueprints, integrated applications, data flow

                                            6

 



           DECdecision, Version 2.0                              SPD 25.G2.03


              arrows, and control flow arrows to a blueprint. Or, users can di-
              rectly edit the application commands that Builder recorded in an
              existing blueprint.

           o  Debug mode - to examine the state of the applications by stepping
              through the execution of the blueprint.

           To help users learn about Builder, a set of pre-recorded blueprints
           are provided that show how Builder works and how the DECdecision com-
           ponents work together with Builder. Each guided blueprint contains in-
           formation boxes that appear before each major step of blueprint play-
           back, explaining what is about to happen.

           System-wide Features

           Ease-of-Use

           DECdecision features a control panel for convenient startup of the com-
           ponents, customization for modifying various characteristics of the
           DECdecision environment, and an extensive online Help system. In ad-
           dition, DECdecision incorporates the use of Pop-up windows through-
           out the product for a quick listing of currently available functions,
           and accelerator keys and command line entry for experienced users.

           Documentation

           Most of the product documentation has been placed in the DECwindows
           Motif online Help system. Each DECdecision component has a Help menu
           to provide information about using the component. In addition, all di-
           alog boxes have Help buttons that provide online assistance.

           In addition, the following printed documentation is available:

           Relationship to DECwrite

           DECwrite is a compound document processing application that allows Open-
           VMS users to create and format documents which contain text, graph-
           ics, images, and supported application data.

           Reports generated within Query, Calc, and graphs from DECchart can be
           incorporated into DECwrite through the use of DECwrite's LiveLink util-
           ity. In addition, DECwrite can read DECdecision's Digital Document In-
           terchange Format (DDIF) report files directly.

           HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

           DECdecision V2.0 will run, as client and/or server, on any processor
           currently supported by OpenVMS with the exception being those proces-
           sors specifically listed under Processors Not Supported.

           Processor Restrictions:

           A TK50 Tape Drive is required for standalone MicroVAX 2000 and VAXs-
           tation 2000 systems.

           Processors Not Supported:

           MicroVAX I, VAX 4000 Model 200 Series, VAXstation I, VAXstation 8000,
           VAX-11/725, VAX-11/730, VAX-11/782

           Other Hardware Requirements

           o  Minimum disk required: One RD54 or two RZ23 disks

           Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1):

           Disk space required for     48,000 blocks
           installation:
                                       (24.0M bytes)

           Disk space required for     29,000 blocks
           use (permanent):
                                       (14.5M bytes)

           These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
           sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
           system environment, configuration, and software options.

           Memory Requirements

           The minimum supported memory for this application running in a stan-
           dalone DECwindows environment with both the client and server execut-
           ing on that same system is 16 Mb.

           DECdecision, Version 2.0                              SPD 25.G2.03


           The performance and memory usage of DECwindows applications are par-
           ticularly sensitive to system configuration. Less memory may be re-
           quired on the client system (the system where the software is installed
           and executed) if the server (the component that displays the appli-
           cation) resides on another system. More memory may be required on a
           system with several applications running, or where it may be desir-
           able to improve the performance of an application.

           DECdecision text files can be printed on any Digital text printer.

           DECdecision PostScript[R] files can be printed using any Digital PostScript
           printer (ScriptPrinter LN03R, PrintServer 20, PrintServer 40, or the
           PrintServer 40 Plus laser printer).

           DECdecision produces both monochrome and color PostScript. Monochrome
           PostScript can be printed using any Digital PostScript printer (Script-
           Printer LN03R, PrintServer 20, PrintServer 40, and the PrintServer 40
           Plus Laser Printer). If the DECprint Utility for PostScript to Sixel
           Printing for OpenVMS is installed, then DECdecision PostScript out-
           put (either color or monochrome) can be printed on the Digital LJ250
           Companion Color Printer.

           CLUSTER ENVIRONMENT
