 PRODUCT NAME:  VAX COBOL Version 5.3 for OpenVMS VAX Systems    SPD
 25.04.27

 DESCRIPTION

 VAX COBOL is a high-level language for business data processing that
 operates on the OpenVMS VAX Operating System, taking full advantage
 of the system facilities. VAX COBOL is based upon the 1985 ANSI COBOL
 Standard X3.23-1985 as modified by the X.23a-1989 amendment.

 VAX COBOL includes various industry standard and Digital extensions
 to COBOL, including screen handling at the source language level, file
 sharing and record locking.

 VAX COBOL has been validated at the high level by the National Bureau
 of Standards for conformance to 'FIPS PUB 21-3, Federal Standard COBOL.'

 The Data Manipulation Language (DML), allows users to write programs
 that access DBMS databases using the Oracle DBMS database. Oracle DBMS
 must be installed to use this feature. The COPY FROM DICTIONARY state-
 ment, another Digital COBOL extension, allows access to common record
 definitions stored in the Oracle CDD/Repository. Oracle CDD/Repository
 must be installed to use this feature.

 The following list of Digital extentions to COBOL are implemented in
 VAX COBOL:

 o  Screen handling is implemented using the DISPLAY and ACCEPT state-
    ments. The DISPLAY statement enables the programmer to display in-
    formation or prompts anywhere on a video screen. The ACCEPT state-
    ment takes information typed anywhere on the screen and returns the
    value to a running VAX COBOL program. The DISPLAY statement con-
    verts data from internal numeric format to 'ASCII display format';
    and the ACCEPT WITH CONVERSION statement converts 'ASCII display'
    input characters to internal numeric formats as appropriate. The

                               DIGITAL                September 1995

 

    terminal-type is recognized at run time from information provided
    by the operating system.

 o  RMS-STS and RMS-STV special registers may be examined to assist de-
    bugging. These registers contain status values from the Record Man-
    agement System (OpenVMS RMS).

 o  File sharing and record locking features enable more than one user
    to access data at the same time.

 o  Many file capabilities are available through RMS including exten-
    sions for segmented keys, descending keys, and duplicate primary
    keys.

 o  Conditional compilation serves to make debugging easier.

 o  The /INSTRUCTION_SET qualifier customizes object code generation
    to target the different classes of VAX processors, maximizing spe-
    cific processor features.

 o  Access to Oracle DBMS databases through the CODASYL definition of
    COBOL Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements.

 o  Access to Oracle CDD/Repository record and field definitions.

 o  Source program terminal format recognition.

 VAX COBOL implements several statements and extensions designed to make
 programming easier in the OpenVMS for VAX environment:

 o  CALL statement extensions: BY VALUE, BY DESCRIPTOR, OMITTED, and
    GIVING

 o  VALUE IS EXTERNAL - Access to link time constants

 o  USAGE IS POINTER - Address data type

 o  VALUE IS REFERENCE - Compile time address evaluation

 o  SET TO REFERENCE - Run time address evaluation

 o  SUCCESS/FAILURE - Class conditions

 o  Thirty-one-character user-names

 o  ACCEPT AT END statement

                                  2

 

 o  Single-quote-delimited, non-numeric literals

 o  Hyphen/underscore equivalence in user-names

 o  Non-numeric literal argument passing

 The VAX COBOL compiler produces an object module from a source pro-
 gram. The compiler is capable of producing a source listing with em-
 bedded diagnostics indicating the line and position of a source-code
 error, a machine language listing, a file-name map, a data-name map,
 a procedure-name map, an external program name map, subschema infor-
 mation, and a cross-reference listing. The cross-reference listing and
 maps may be produced in either alphabetical order or in order of dec-
 laration. The cross-reference listing distinguishes destructive ref-
 erences to data from read-only references.

 VAX COBOL provides support for error diagnostics and cross-reference
 information to DEC Language-Sensitive Editor/Source Code Analyzer. Ad-
 ditionally, VAX COBOL provides support for the processing of pseudocode
 and design comments that are used by the DEC Language-Sensitive Ed-
 itor/Source Code Analyzer for low-level program design.

 Object modules produced by the compiler can be linked with other ob-
 ject modules produced by many other languages, including VAX BASIC and
 DEC Fortran. VAX COBOL is supported by both the OpenVMS VAX Common Run
 Time Library (RTL) and the OpenVMS for Symbolic Debugger.

 The VAX COBOL product includes a COBOL compiler and the REFORMAT util-
 ity. The REFORMAT utility converts source programs from Digital ter-
 minal format to ANSI-standard COBOL format and vice versa.
