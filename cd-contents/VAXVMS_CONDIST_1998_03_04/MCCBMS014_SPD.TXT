          DESCRIPTION

          The POLYCENTER Network Manager 200 is a complete, prepackaged
          POLYCENTER Product Family management system for multivendor,
          multi-protocol networks. It provides access to, and management
          functions for, Digital Equipment Corporation's ADVANTAGE-NETWORKS
          (DECnet Phase IV, DECnet/OSI, and TCP/IP) and open network
          environments. The POLYCENTER Network Manager 200 is a modular software
          product that can be extended through the addition of other POLYCENTER
          products, third party, or user-developed software modules.

          Available on the OpenVMS and Ultrix Operating Systems, the POLYCENTER
          Network Manager 200 provides both generic and device-specific 
          management functions including:

          o  Motif Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Command Line User Inter-
             faces that provide consistent views and interactions with the man-
             agement system regardless of the objects managed or the protocols 
             used to manage them.

          o  Configuration Management functions that include automated discov-
             ery and device registration, topology mapping, and user-defined 
             management domains.

          o  Notification and Alarm functions that enable users to define alarm
             rules and set up notification and automated procedures to locate
             existing and potential network problems or events. Enhanced Alarm 
             copy and modify capabilities are present in this release of the 
             product.

          (Formerly DECmcc Basic Management System, BMS)

          o  Historical Data Recording and Data Export functions that allow
             users to define, collect, timestamp, and re-use historical network
             data and export POLYCENTER management information to an external 
             relational data base.

          o  Device-specific Performance Statistics functions for DECnet Phase
             IV and DECnet/OSI nodes; Digital LAN Bridges; and TCP/IP hosts.

          Consistent with the EMA Director Model, of which it is an implemen-
          tation, the POLYCENTER Framework consists of four major elements that
          comprise an extensible management system: Management Modules; an Ex-
          ecutive; an open Applications Program Interface (API); and a Manage-
          ment Information Repository (MIR).

          o  Management Modules provide services to users and to one another.
             There are three types of Management Modules:

             -  Function Modules (FMs) provide services such as object regis-
                tration, statistics generation, fault detection, and notifica-
                tion to users and to one another.

             -  Access Modules (AMs) provide remote protocol support for, and
                management information about, different classes of managed 
                objects.

             -  Presentation Modules (PMs) provide a consistent user interface
                for the direct manipulation of managed objects (through AMs) and
                user access to management operations (through FMs).

          o  The Executive provides system services that enable Management Mod-
             ules to be installed and used independently or in combination.

          o  The Applications Programming Interface (API) defines how Manage-
             ment Modules invoke each other's services. The POLYCENTER Frame-
             work API is open and documented to support Digital, third party,
             or user-developed modules.

          o  The Management Information Repository (MIR) provides a means to
             structure and store management information.

          POLYCENTER Network Manager 200, Version 1.4           SPD 32.48.05
          (Formerly DECmcc Basic Management System, BMS)

          POLYCENTER Network Manager 200 Function Modules

          The POLYCENTER Network Manager 200 includes generic and
          device-specific FMs that provide a variety of management services to
          end users and, in combination, to one another. These services include
          configuration management functions, fault management functions
          including alarm and notification services, historical data recording
          and data export functions, and performance statistics functions.

          Generic FM services provide support for devices accessible through the
          POLYCENTER Network Manager 200 AMs, other Digital-developed AMs, or
          AMs developed and supported by third parties and users.

          Configuration Management Functions

          POLYCENTER Network Manager 200 Configuration Management functions in-
          clude both manual and automatic registration of managed objects, and
          support for user-defined domains (groups of managed objects). These
          functions are provided by the following POLYCENTER Network Manager 200
          FMs and services:

          The Registration FM is a generic FM that enables users to enter and
          manage data identifying each managed object in a network environment.
          Such information includes object instance data such as network names
          and addresses, and reference information such as device location,
          software revision levels, and contact names.

          With the Registration FM, users have the option of selecting a local
          system-level repository, or setting up a network-wide,
          globally-available naming service using Digital's Distributed Name
          Service (DECdns). With DECdns, users and applications can assign names
          to resources (such as nodes, bridges, files, domain names, etc.) and
          then use those resources without having to keep track of physical
          location or network address. The DECdns option also enables multiple
          POLYCENTER Managers to share the same view of managed objects.

          (Formerly DECmcc Basic Management System, BMS)

          The Domain FM is a generic FM that enables users to assign managed ob-
          jects into groups called domains. Domains are subsets of the managed
          object configuration that provide user-defined groups that can be
          based on equipment type (all DECnet nodes, all TCP/IP hosts, all LAN
          Bridges, etc.), geography (all objects within a LAN, building, campus,
          or subnet), personnel levels, or any other user-defined object
          group. Domains can contain or refer to other domains and can be
          hierarchical or overlapping. Individual managed objects can be
          contained within multiple domains.

          Autoconfiguration services automatically locate, register, and map
          managed objects by class. Supported classes include DECnet Phase IV
          nodes,TCP /IP hosts, and Digital FDDI devices and LAN Bridges. Note
          that DECnet OSI support is included with DNS Autotopology mechanism.
          Users can define domains for each class, and set network boundaries.
          The autoconfiguration functions can request network instance data
          from DECnet routers, IP gateways, and Bridge spanning trees. As
          devices are located and management information gathered, the functions
          automatically map them in the appropriate user-defined domains and
          register management data in the MIR.

          Note: This function requires that the appropriate POLYCENTER Access
          Modules be installed on the POLYCENTER Network Manager 200 system to
          register objects. The DECnet Phase IV, DECnet/OSI, and TCP/IP SNMP
          AMs are included in POLYCENTER Network Manager 200. The POLYCENTER ELM
          Access Module must be purchased separately to support LAN Bridge and
          FDDI autoconfiguration topology mapping. Refer to the POLYCENTER ELM
          SPD (31.33.xx) for more information about the POLYCENTER ELM products.

          IP Reachability Poller sends notification to POLYCENTER Network Man-
          ager 200 Notification Services when a specific IP node changes state
          (ie. becomes reachable or unreachable). It provides POLYCENTER Net-
          work Manager 200 an efficient manner to determine if IP nodes are
          reachable or not.

          Alarm and Notification Services

          POLYCENTER Network Manager 200 alarm and notification services are
          provided by a combination of Management Modules. These modules
          enable users to create alarm rules that can detect existing or
          potential network problems, and notification mechanisms for informing
          users when such problems occur or network events happen.

          The Alarms FM provides facilities for users to write rule-based ex-
          pressions (alarm rules) that use polled data or unsolicited event mes-
          sages to trigger alarms. Alarm rules can be written for any managed
          object or entity class for which there is corresponding Access Mod-
          ule protocol support (DECnet Phase IV NICE, SNMP, etc.). Alarm rules
          can be based on state changes, simple arithmetic expressions, or oc-
          currences (unsolicited event messages received through the appropri-
          ate Access Module). Alarm rules can be written for individual managed
          objects or wildcarding can be used to apply rules to all objects in a
          domain for a given object class.

          In addition to the standard POLYCENTER Network Manager 200 notifica-
          tion functions described below, the Alarms FM allows for the execu-
          tion of user-written command procedures. Such command procedures can
          be used to generate terminal broadcast or electronic mail messages,
          or automated procedures that a network manager or operator might im-
          plement when a particular alarm condition occurs.

          In combination with the Network Statistics (also known as the Perfor-
          mance Analysis FM) described below, the alarm functions can be used to
          create threshold alarms based on performance statistics for DECnet
          Nodes, TCP/IP hosts, RMON probes, or Digital LAN Bridges. In this way,
          alarm rules allow users to detect potential problems before they
          become major network faults.

          The Notification FM and PM enable users to define the mechanisms used
          to alert operators when a particular network or system event has oc-
          curred. The functions recognize two types of events: configuration
          events, which are reported by a managed object or POLYCENTER
          Management Module; and alarm events, which are generated by the
          Alarms FM whenever a rule fires or encounters an error (i.e., an
          exception to the rule).

          (Formerly DECmcc Basic Management System, BMS)

          When an event occurs, the Motif/Iconic Map PM displays a color change
          on the appropriate object icon and a message in the Notification win-
          dow. Users can define the severity levels and select colors appropri-
          ate to the problem level. POLYCENTER Notification also enables users
          to customize event collection and storage in the following ways:

          o  Logging: logging can be used to store received events to disk. Log
             files are automatically created and purged based on user-definable
             arguments.

          o  Filter: users can filter received events based on the following
             criteria: managed object, domain, severity level, message text, or
             event /alarm type.

          o  Target: Notifications (icon color changes) can be redirected from
             the object that generates the event to the object that is the sub-
             ject of the event.

          o  Search: users can search received notifications based on the fol-
             lowing criteria: any field, severity level, notification 
             identifier, name or address, text description, time stamp, or 
             domain name.

          o  View: users can display a Real-time Graph of the number of noti-
             fications being displayed, collected and filtered; histogram of all
             notifications grouped by severity level; and the maximum notifi-
             cation buffer size.

          o  Change default start-up: users can assign customized colors to the
             six notification severity levels.

          The Event Collector AM (also known as the Data Collector AM) enables
          users to collect events from objects not directly managed by POLYCEN-
          TER Network Manager. Users can create customized icons for any object
          not directly managed by POLYCENTER Network Manager and include it in
          the Iconic Map.

          The Event Collector AM provides a programming interface and a command
          script interface. The programming interface allows users to include

          POLYCENTER Network Manager 200, Version 1.4           SPD 32.48.05
           (Formerly DECmcc Basic Management System, BMS)

          code in any application program to send events to POLYCENTER Frame-
          work for display in the Iconic Map or Notification window. The com-
          mand script interface enables users to use OpenVMS DCL command pro-
          cedures or Ultrix shell scripts to send events to the POLYCENTER
          Framework for display in the Iconic Map or Notification window. The
          transport mechanisms over which events can be collected have been
          expanded in this version to include both UDP/IP and DECnet.


          Historical Data Collection and Data Export

          Historical Data Collection and Data Export functions are provided by
          the Historian and Exporter FMs. These generic FMs enable users to col-
          lect, time stamp, and store network data for use by other POLYCENTER
          FMs, such as the Performance Analyzer FM, and export data to exter-
          nal relational databases for addition processing and report writing.

          o  The Historian FM enables users to define the type of data to be
             collected, the managed objects or management applications from 
             which the data is to be collected, and the collection interval.

          o  The Exporter FM, when used with a separate external relational data
             base and report writing tools, can be used to create customized 
             network usage reports. The historical data recording and data 
             export functions can also be used in combination with other 
             POLYCENTER FMs to gather statistics, status, and configuration 
             data.

          Note: Use of the Exporter FM requires that Rdb Runtime for OpenVMS
          systems or INGRES[TM] for RISC/Ultrix systems be installed on the
          target system - the system to which the data is to be exported.

          Network Statistics Functions

          Network Statistics FM enables users to access real-time or histori-
          cal performance statistics and reports on DECnet, Digital LAN Bridge,
          and TCP/IP objects (including RMON probes). Sample error, traffic, and
          statistics reports are also provided.

          (Formerly DECmcc Basic Management System, BMS)

          The Performance Analyzer FM provides data normalization and statis-
          tical functions for DECnet nodes, TCP/IP hosts, RMON probes and Dig-
          ital LAN Bridges.

          Note: LAN Bridge statistics require that the POLYCENTER ELM AM and FM
          option be installed on POLYCENTER Network Manager 200. Counters for
          DECnet node and TCP/IP hosts are gathered by the DECnet AMs and TCP
          /IP SNMP AM respectively, which are included with POLYCENTER Network
          Manager 200.

          Assuming that the appropriate Access Modules are installed, the Per-
          formance Analyzer FM supports the following objects/devices:

          o  DECnet Phase IV lines (DDCMP, Ethernet, X.25), circuits (DDCMP, 
             Ethernet, X.25), and nodes (local and remote)

          o  DECnet/OSI end systems, datalinks (DDCMP, CSMACD, and HDLC), in-
             termediate systems (routing systems), routing ports, and routing
             circuits

          o  Bridge lines (LAN100, LAN150, LAN200, DECbridge 500, and DECbridge
             600)

          o  TCP/IP Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), Exterior Gate-
             way Protocol (EGP), Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), IN-
             TERFACE (the network interface such as Ethernet), Internet Proto-
             col (IP), Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User Datagram Pro-
             tocol (UDP), EGP Neighbor table, SNMP child entity, and RMON.

          The Performance Analyzer FM supports the following classes of network
          statistics:

          o  Throughput - the amount of data that is sent between two points in
             a specified unit of time.

          o  Averages - such as Average Outbound Block Size and Average Outbound
             Message Size

          o  Overhead - the amount of control overhead present for circuits and
             lines

          o  Percents - percent of total traffic or resource availability

          (Formerly DECmcc Basic Management System, BMS)

          o  Rates - the counts over a specified period of time

          o  Utilization - ratio of real or rated throughput to the actual
             throughput expressed as a percentage, such as Outbound Utilization
             and Single Destination Utilization

          o  Counts - the normalized value of counters

          These statistics, like all other numeric attributes collected or gen-
          erated by POLYCENTER network management software, can be displayed as
          graphs or histograms in the Graphic Window that is part of the Motif
          GUI Iconic Map interface included with the POLYCENTER Framework, POLY-
          CENTER Network Manager 200, and POLYCENTER Network Manager 400 prod-
          ucts.

          Sample Reports are included with POLYCENTER Network Manager 200 and
          are based on counters and statistics generated by the Performance An-
          alyzer FM.

          Note: Data used for creating the sample reports must be exported to an
          external relational database using the Exporter FM. In addition, gen-
          erating and setting up the sample reports requires the following soft-
          ware products:

          o  For OpenVMS: CDD Repository, DATATRIEVE, and DECgraph

          o  For Ultrix: INGRES Tools for SQL including: INGRES Base Tools (with
             Report-Writer[TM]) and INGRES/Visual-Graphics-Editor (VIGRAPH[TM]).

          o  The sample reports include: traffic, error, traffic summary, er-
             ror summary and bandwidth utilization for DECnet Phase IV, DECnet
             /OSI and TCP/IP SNMP.

          (Formerly DECmcc Basic Management System, BMS)

          POLYCENTER Network Manager 200 Access Modules

          POLYCENTER Network Manager 200 AMs provide access to network and sys-
          tem objects in Digital's ADVANTAGE-NETWORKS and other mixed, multi-
          vendor network environments that use the following management proto-
          cols: DECnet NICE, DECnet/OSI CMIP, SNMP, and IEEE 802.2/Ethernet/MOP.

          o  The DECnet Phase IV AM enables users to manage DECnet Phase IV 
             objects such as nodes, circuits, lines, and adjacencies. With the 
             DECnet Phase IV AM, users can modify DECnet parameters, set charac-
             teristics, collect DECnet events, and poll for management data 
             such as counters or status.

          o  The DECnet/OSI CMIP AM provides management access to DECnet devices
             that use DIGITAL's implementation of the standard Common Management
             Information Protocol (CMIP). This version of CMIP, implemented on
             DECnet/OSI devices, provides management operations and data gath-
             ering functions for DECnet/OSI networks including the ability to 
             sink DECnet events to the POLYCENTER Framework.

          o  The TCP/IP SNMP AM includes support for the following Internet Ad-
             visory Board (IAB) Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) RFCs:
             1155, 1156, 1157, 1212, and 1213. This includes full MIB II  
             support in addition to support for on-site enrollment of 
             vendor-specific Enterprise MIBs including:

             -  A MIB translation utility that automatically checks the syntax
                of the ASN.1 Concise MIB definition (providing error messages
                to help identify syntax problems) and translates the data for
                loading the information into the POLYCENTER Framework's Manage-
                ment Information Repository (MIR). The translation utility au-
                tomatically generates on-line HELP.

             -  An event-logging sink for collecting SNMP generic traps (unso-
                licited TCP/IP event messages) including: coldStart, warmStart,
                linkDown, linkUp, egpNeighborLoss, authentificationFailure, and
                enterpriseSpecific. Vendor Specific Traps are also supported 
                with this release of the product.

             -  Ability to perform GET and SET operations on devices supported
                by SNMP agents.

          POLYCENTER Network Manager 200, Version 1.4           SPD 32.48.05
          (Formerly DECmcc Basic Management System, BMS)

             -  ICMP ECHO_REQUEST (ping) support for verifying the reachabil-
                ity of an SNMP managed object at the IP level.

             Note: DEC TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS (UCX) is required for using
             the TCP/IP SNMP AM on OpenVMS systems.

          o  The IEEE 802.3/Ethernet Station AM enables users to manage at the
             network interface level any 802.3/Ethernet LAN device that supports
             MOP REQID, MOP SYSID, MOP Counters, Ethernet V2 Loopback, 
             IEEE 802.2 XID, or IEEE 802.2 Test.

          o  Circuit AM works as a client of management protocol modules to pro-
             vide management of circuits connecting endpoints compliant with the
             Network Management Forum (NMF) definitions. Compliant endpoints 
             include DECnet Phase IV and DECnet/OSI nodes, and TCP/IP hosts. 
             Tying together circuit, line, link, and other end-point data, 
             this AM can gather status data and store reference information 
             about simple, point-to-point circuits or complex multi-channel 
             circuits.

          o  The Script AM is a generic access module that executes a script (or
             command procedure) and propagates the output data back into POLY-
             CENTER Network Manager 200 as individual attributes. Once 
             integrated, these attributes can take advantage of the alarming, 
             notification, and recording facilities of POLYCENTER Network 
             Manager 200.

          o  The Script AM offers the following advantages:

             -  Allows integration of data into POLYCENTER Network Manager 200
                quickly and easily. No C code is required to write a script.

             -  Allows management of devices which provide only a command line
                interface.

             -  Allows integration of any data into POLYCENTER Network Manager
                200 as attributes whether from a Structured Query Language (SQL)
                command, a system command or running a script on a remote sys-
                tem.

             -  Allows integration of data from an executable for which source
                code is not available.

          POLYCENTER Network Manager 200 Presentation Modules

          The POLYCENTER Network Manager 200 includes two Presentation Modules.
          The Motif Graphical User Interface (GUI) provides an iconic map in-
          terface with pull-down and pop-up command and monitor windows that
          consistently present all managed objects and operations. Consistent
          access is also provided by the Forms and Command Line PM. The LAN
          Autotopology PM is provided as an option.

          The capabilities specific to the Motif GUI presentation style include:

          o  Map windows that display the contents of a managed environment (for
             example, a domain) using icons to represent managed objects and
             their subordinate or child objects. Users can select icons 
             representing managed objects and initiate management operations 
             from a map window. Several map windows can be displayed at one 
             time, each displaying different views of domains of a managed 
             environment.

          o  A Navigation box and ViewPort window that enable users to view an
             entire network configuration map at one time. With the ViewPort 
             feature, users can navigate to, and select a particular portion 
             of, the total network environment to display in detail in the Map 
             window.

          o  Management windows that enable users to select, perform, and view
             the results of management operations. Like map windows, several 
             different management windows can be displayed simultaneously.

          o  Graph windows that enable users to select and display real-time or
             historical numeric attributes, such as counters, graphs or 
             histograms.

          o  A Toolbox window and other customization features that provide
             users with the ability to create, modify, or delete map icons,
             connecting lines, text, or other items in a map window. Users can
             create map icons, add geographic maps or other backdrops, and add
             customized icons to the Toolbox for retrieval and re-use.

          (Formerly DECmcc Basic Management System, BMS)

          o  The POLYCENTER Dictionary Browser lets you examine the management
             objects and their definitions stored in the POLYCENTER Network Man-
             ager 200 dictionary. It provides an easy-to-use graphical alter-
             native to SHOW and DUMP commands available in the Dictionary Ad-
             ministrator Program. Using the Browser, the user can graphically 
             view the types of entities that are configured for a POLYCENTER 
             Network Manager 200.

          Forms and Command Line PM provides character cell access to POLYCEN-
          TER Network Manager function and access capabilities. The interface
          supports two modes, Command Line Mode and Forms Mode.

          Note: The Forms Mode is not available on Ultrix.

          The Command Line mode enables users to create names or mnemonics and
          use special symbols to reduce data entry and eliminate input errors.
          It supports command line recall and editing, abbreviation, online
          help, symbol substitution, use of control key sequences, line
          continuation, and the typeahead function.

          Command Line mode also supports the use of scripts to automate fre-
          quently used POLYCENTER Network Manager command sequences. Users can
          set up initialization files through the Command Line mode for estab-
          lishing defaults and executing startup directives. In addition, users
          can log any command to an output file for storage and review.

          The Forms mode provides the basic features of the Command Line mode
          in addition to a scroll feature that enables users to save up to 500
          lines of output from management directives, scroll through the saved
          output, and create new directives based on previous input. The Forms
          mode also allows printing and logging of entries made to the output
          region.

          Both the Forms mode and the Command Line mode, as well as the Iconic
          Map interface, provide online, context-sensitive help.

          POLYCENTER Network Manager 200 Extensibility

          POLYCENTER Network Manager 200 is an extensible management platform to
          which other POLYCENTER software modules, option packages, third party,
          or user-developed Management Modules can be added. For a list of Dig-
          ital Management Modules that can be added to the POLYCENTER Network
          Manager 200, refer to the OPTIONAL SOFTWARE section.

          Third parties and users can develop software modules for POLYCENTER
          Network Management Family of Products to provide access to and man-
          agement functions for any manageable object. Software and documenta-
          tion for the development of integrated POLYCENTER modules are avail-
          able as part of the POLYCENTER Framework Developer's Toolkit. For more
          information about the Developer's Toolkit, refer to SPD 32.49.xx.

          POLYCENTER Network Manager 200 includes several utilities that enable
          on-site enrollment of Management Modules. Documentation required for
          third party module enrollment must be supplied by the module devel-
          oper.

          (Formerly DECmcc Basic Management System, BMS)

          CLUSTER ENVIRONMENT

          This layered product is fully supported when installed on any valid
          and licensed VAXcluster* configuration without restrictions. The HARD-
          WARE REQUIREMENTS section details any special hardware required by
          this product.

          *  V5.x VAXcluster configurations are fully described in the VAXclus-
             ter Software Product Description (29.78.xx) and include CI, Eth-
             ernet, and Mixed Interconnect configurations.

          IMPORTANT INTEROPERABILITY INFORMATION FOR OPENVMS USERS ONLY

          Interoperability problems may occur when more than one product con-
          taining DECthreads is installed on a system. This occurs because some
          products overwrite the system version of DECthreads. If a product with
          a different version of DECthreads is installed after POLYCENTER Frame-
          work, problems may occur.

          POLYCENTER Framework V1.4 is linked with DECthreads V1.0-422. Later
          versions of DECthreads have a backwards compatible API. Consequently,
          no problem should result from having a more recent version of
          DECthreads on the system.

          Only SSB versions of DECthreads are supported.

          SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS FOR OPENVMS

          For Systems Using Terminals (no DECwindows Motif interface):
