          PRODUCT NAME:  DIGITAL DATATRIEVE Version 7.2 for OpenVMS VAX Systems
          SPD 24.44.31

          DESCRIPTION

          DIGITAL[TM] DATATRIEVE[TM] for OpenVMS[TM] VAX[TM] systems is a query,
          report, and data management tool for the OpenVMS Operating System. It
          provides a uniform access method for data stored by RMS[TM], Oracle Rdb[TM],
          and Oracle CODASYL DBMS[TM] files on OpenVMS and data residing in other
          databases accessible by the Oracle Rdb Transparent Gateway[TM] prod-
          ucts. Using DIGITAL DATATRIEVE, a novice or experienced user can re-
          trieve or modify data without considering the underlying storage method
          or physical location.

          Modes of Operation

          DIGITAL DATATRIEVE presents information in several different formats.
          Information can be displayed using simple defaults or can be reported
          on through a more flexible report writer. Information can be displayed
          on a terminal or workstation, printed on a hard-copy device, or writ-
          ten to a file. Information can also be presented graphically with user-
          defined VAX FMS[TM] and VAX TDMS forms, as well as with DECforms[TM].
          Graphics output is ReGIS[TM]; it can be managed by devices or convert-
          ers accepting ReGIS. DIGITAL DATATRIEVE also provides an efficient way
          to access information stored on other VAX, Alpha or PDP[TM]-11 sys-
          tems linked by DECnet[TM].

          DIGITAL DATATRIEVE can be used interactively to retrieve, modify, store,
          or delete data using a simple set of commands. Frequently used com-
          binations of commands can be stored as named procedures and invoked

                                                                December 1997

                                                                  AE-PVM0E-TE

          by name. Programs written in other DIGITAL languages can call DIGI-
          TAL DATATRIEVE, allowing them to be independent of underlying data stor-
          age methods and physical location.

          A DECwindows[TM] Motif[R] interface to DIGITAL DATATRIEVE is provided.
          This allows the user to perform a subset of the DIGITAL DATATRIEVE func-
          tions using menu bars, scroll bars, pop-up menus, pull-down menus, and
          buttons. The user can also use a navigator to browse through the dic-
          tionary directories, select objects, and execute commands on them di-
          rectly from pop-up menus.

          Data Dictionary

          DIGITAL DATATRIEVE is dictionary driven. DIGITAL DATATRIEVE has re-
          moved the dependencies from Oracle CDD/Repository by supporting a new
          textfile dictionary in addition to Oracle CDD/Repository. DIGITAL DATA-
          TRIEVE provides the following two independent dictionary alternatives:

          o  Data Dictionary using Oracle CDD/Repository for OpenVMS.

          o  DIGITAL DATATRIEVE textfile-based dictionary.

          Data Dictionary using Oracle CDD/Repository for OpenVMS

          Using this dictionary, data descriptions are stored in and retrieved
          from Oracle CDD/Repository for OpenVMS. DIGITAL DATATRIEVE includes
          commands to store, examine, modify, and delete definitions in the dic-
          tionary and can use definitions stored by other layered products, such
          as the Oracle CODASYL DBMS schema definitions or the Oracle Rdb for
          OpenVMS database definitions. DATATRIEVE requires the Oracle/CDD Repos-
          itory in order to manage the Oracle CODASYL DBMS databases.

          DIGITAL DATATRIEVE fully supports CDO format dictionaries, including
          the ability to access shareable fields. Pieces tracking is also sup-
          ported for these entities. DIGITAL DATATRIEVE includes full support
          for DMU format dictionaries as well.

          DIGITAL DATATRIEVE Version 7.2 for OpenVMS VAX SystemsSPD 24.44.31


          Textfile-based Dictionary

          If Oracle CDD/Repository is present on the system, you can select, at
          installation time, whether to link DATATRIEVE with Oracle CDD/Repository
          or not. When Oracle CDD/Repository is linked to DATATRIEVE, its use
          can dynamically be disabled and enabled at run-time by using the SET
          CDD and SET NO CDD commands. When Oracle CDD/Repository is not linked
          to DATATRIEVE, the alternative textfile dictionary is enabled.

          The new textfile dictionary stores the DIGITAL DATATRIEVE object def-
          initions as text in text files.

          Oracle CDD/Repository object definitions can be extracted and rede-
          fined as files in the new dictionary system. Text file definitions can-
          not be shared with compilers and database systems, but can be accessed
          and manipulated by applications and OpenVMS utilities.

          Temporary Definition of Objects

          DIGITAL DATATRIEVE extends the use of the DECLARE command to define
          DIGITAL DATATRIEVE objects. Such objects are temporary (time scope is
          within a DIGITAL DATATRIEVE session) and do not depend on any dictio-
          nary system, as they are stored in memory.

          Protection

          o  Protection with Oracle CDD/Repository

             When DIGITAL DATATRIEVE accesses data through data definitions stored
             by Oracle CDD/Repository for OpenVMS, protection provided by Or-
             acle
             CDD/Repository applies. An Access Control List associated with an
             object definition specifies which types of access are granted to
             the definition itself, and to the defined data. Standard OpenVMS
             Access Elements can be used based on usernames, UICs, and identi-
             fiers. Access rights for terminals can be specified also.

          o  Protection with the DATATRIEVE resident dictionary using text files



                                           3

 



          DIGITAL DATATRIEVE Version 7.2 for OpenVMS VAX SystemsSPD 24.44.31


             Text file definitions are subject to the OpenVMS ACL protections,
             and must be defined and managed by the programmer, using the ap-
             propriate DATATRIEVE or OpenVMS commands.

          o  Protection with in-memory temporary object definitions

             In-memory temporary object definitions do not use any protection
             mechanisms, and bypass those definitions defined by either Oracle
             CDD/Repository or the textfile dictionary.

          Remote Data Access

          DIGITAL DATATRIEVE provides access to data on remote systems in two
          ways as follows:

          o  Takes advantage of the remote data access functionality transpar-
             ently provided by the individual data base management systems (for
             example, RMS remote files, Oracle Rdb remote databases) according
             to their rules.

          o  Requests a DATATRIEVE server to start on the remote system (Open-
             VMS Alpha and VAX systems or PDP-11) to manage the data definitions
             and process data remotely. Most operations are performed on the server
             node and only selected data is exchanged between the requester and
             the server systems. To work in this way, a DATATRIEVE system (DIG-
             ITAL DATATRIEVE or DATATRIEVE-11) must be installed on the server
             node.

          For the Nonprogrammer

          DIGITAL DATATRIEVE provides the novice user with a tutorial mode called
          GUIDE Mode.

          DIGITAL DATATRIEVE offers ADT (Application Design Tool) for the more
          experienced user who wants to define data structures. ADT takes the
          user step-by-step through the definition of a domain based on an RMS
          data file.

          If DIGITAL DATATRIEVE is used on the same information by experienced
          and novice users, the novice user can use the full power of the lan-
          guage by invoking procedures designed by the more experienced user.

          For the Programmer

          DIGITAL DATATRIEVE is a highly structured language that provides au-
          tomatic access optimization, data type conversion, and data valida-
          tion. Looping and control structures, such as IF THEN ELSE, BEGIN END,
          REPEAT, WHILE, CHOICE and FOR (each record) can be combined and nested
          to create complex, powerful procedures.

          DIGITAL DATATRIEVE responds to programming errors with clear, explicit
          error messages. The user can issue an EDIT command to invoke a text
          editor with an erroneous statement as input text, correct the mistake,
          and resubmit the command. This editor can be either EDT, TPU, or DEC
          Language-Sensitive Editor (LSE) and is controlled by a user logical
          name assignment.

          Data Definition

          DIGITAL DATATRIEVE stores the fixed attributes of each record in the
          record definition. In addition to COBOL-like attributes, DIGITAL DATA-
          TRIEVE allows validation criteria, fields whose values are computed
          at run-time, missing value expressions, and default values.

          DIGITAL DATATRIEVE supports most data types used by DIGITAL Fortran[TM],
          COBOL, VAX PL/I, DIGITAL C, and DIGITAL BASIC[TM]. DIGITAL DATATRIEVE
          also supports Varying String and Segmented String data types in Or-
          acle Rdb for OpenVMS databases.

          Views

          A VIEW is an alternative description of data. It can be used to al-
          low a user access to a subset of the data items in a record. It can
          restrict a user by including only some of the data items in a record,
          or it can combine data items from several files. Information can be
          linked through common values (or set linkages in Oracle CODASYL DBMS)
          to produce complex hierarchical structures. Using a predefined VIEW,
          a user can access and display data from several files at once with the
          same commands used on a single file. Data accessed through a VIEW can
          be printed and modified, but data cannot be stored or erased using a
          VIEW.

          Call Interface

          DIGITAL DATATRIEVE provides a client/server API. The DATATRIEVE Client
          libraries for OpenVMS and Windows[TM] systems are supplied with the
          kit of the DATATRIEVE product for OpenVMS systems, and can be copied
          freely to Client systems.

          DIGITAL DATATRIEVE can be accessed from the following programs:

          o  Programs linked with DIGITAL DATATRIEVE, residing on the same node
             and process space where DIGITAL DATATRIEVE resides, and written in
             high-level languages such as DIGITAL Fortran, DIGITAL C, COBOL, DIG-
             ITAL BASIC, DIGITAL Pascal[TM], and VAX PL/I.

          o  Programs linked with a DIGITAL DATATRIEVE client library, resid-
             ing on different nodes or platforms, and written in Visual C++[R],
             Visual Basic[R] or OpenVMS program languages.

          DIGITAL DATATRIEVE automatically converts data from its storage for-
          mat to the format expected by the program.

          DIGITAL DATATRIEVE Client for Windows[TM]

          The DIGITAL DATATRIEVE Client/Server architecture allows existing DIG-
          ITAL DATATRIEVE users to downsize and distribute their applications
          and interactive DIGITAL DATATRIEVE operations.

          The DIGITAL DATATRIEVE Client for Windows, previously a separately or-
          derable package, is now included with the server software.

          The DIGITAL DATATRIEVE Client for Windows offers a graphical user in-
          terface that permits users to:

          o  Browse through the dictionary from a Windows desktop.

          o  Access, modify, and execute their existing DIGITAL DATATRIEVE pro-
             cedures and dictionary objects.

          o  Access the DIGITAL DATATRIEVE language for interactive queries us-
             ing a query editor.

          o  Operate on data: display, modify, and store.

          o  Interoperate (data import/export) with other PC applications.

          DIGITAL DATATRIEVE Client for Windows contains the following features,
          that permit users to:

          o  Use a query-by-example mechanism in the Query Editor. A query can
             be specified by providing constraints on field values and simple
             links between fields, without using the graphical query editor.

          o  Define DIGITAL DATATRIEVE objects using specific dialog boxes that
             guide the creation of the objects themselves.

          o  Use plots. DIGITAL DATATRIEVE Client for Windows PLOT statements
             produce graphic results in the client environment.

          o  Use Client/Server TCP/IP transport in addition to DECnet.

          DIGITAL DATATRIEVE Version 7.2 for OpenVMS VAX SystemsSPD 24.44.31


          Storage Methods

          DIGITAL DATATRIEVE uses a single, consistent syntax to provide full
          access to information stored in RMS for OpenVMS sequential or indexed
          files (RMS relative files are supported for queries only), Oracle CO-
          DASYL DBMS, and Oracle Rdb databases. DIGITAL DATATRIEVE can also pro-
          vide access to information stored in certain IBM[R] mainframe databases
          through the use of Oracle Rdb Transparent Gateway for DB2[TM], as well
          as information stored in ORACLE[R] databases through Oracle Rdb Trans-
          parent Gateway for Oracle7 & 8, and SYBASE[R] databases through Or-
          acle Rdb Transparent Gateway for SYBASE. Data from all these sources
          can be combined into a single VIEW.

          If access to a Oracle CODASYL DBMS database involves explicit set walk-
          ing or if records must be manually connected or disconnected from sets,
          the user can employ DIGITAL DATATRIEVE language features that are spe-
          cific to Oracle CODASYL DBMS access. However, if the user employs VIEWS
          or implicit set walking, DIGITAL DATATRIEVE can access information in
          Oracle CODASYL DBMS databases using the same syntax used for data from
          an RMS file or Oracle Rdb.

          Report Generation

          The DIGITAL DATATRIEVE REPORT statement can produce simple formatted
          reports without formatting statements. It also allows the user to over-
          ride the default format when more complex reports are required. Re-
          ports can either be page-based, printable documents, or table-based
          formatted data that can be input by a spreadsheet.

          Column headers and, in page-based reports, page headers containing ti-
          tle, date, and page numbers are produced automatically. Simple state-
          ments (AT TOP, AT BOTTOM) create page headers and trailers for con-
          trol breaks, page breaks or a report summary. DIGITAL DATATRIEVE pro-
          vides all of its statistical functions and value expressions within
          the REPORT statement.

          DIGITAL DATATRIEVE Version 7.2 for OpenVMS VAX SystemsSPD 24.44.31


          Reports can be output in a variety of output formats: table reports
          are produced in DTIF format, page-based reports are produced in DDIF,
          PostScript[R] and Text formats, and online reports are produced in HTML
          format.

          DIGITAL DATATRIEVE Version 7.2 features a HTML report format that en-
          ables you to generate a HTML file suitable for loading into a stan-
          dard Web browser. HTML is a markup language used to create hypertext
          documents that are portable across platforms.

          Usage of DDIF and PostScript allows a variety of text attributes (size,
          font types, rendition) to be applied to any part of the report to ob-
          tain a boardroom-quality output. These attributes, and other print-
          ing characteristics such as page size and orientation, can be selected
          from DIGITAL DATATRIEVE through simple statements without requiring
          the use of a graphical terminal. Simple character-cell based reports
          are also available, using the Text format. Using the CDA[TM] converter
          library, DTIF and DDIF reports can be converted to a variety of out-
          put formats, allowing interoperability with a number of popular ap-
          plications.

          The CDA converter library is supplied as part of DIGITAL DATATRIEVE
          Version 7.2. This packaging eliminates the requirement for a separate
          installation of CDA software or Motif. You can create PostScript re-
          ports using the DIGITAL DATATRIEVE Report Statement.

          The Report Writer provides two layout tools: a grid printout of the
          CDA report layout with placement of rows and columns, including those
          with varying font types, and graphical printout of the layout page,
          with placement of the different report objects (such as header, footer,
          body).

          Reports can be generated from data stored in RMS files, Oracle CODA-
          SYL DBMS and Oracle Rdb databases. Reports can also be generated from
          other databases accessed through the use of the appropriate Oracle Rdb
          Transparent Gateway or DIGITAL DATATRIEVE VIEWS that combine any of
          these databases without any change in the syntax of the REPORT state-
          ment.

          Graphics

          DIGITAL DATATRIEVE includes a number of predefined plots invoked with
          a single command that takes standard record selection expressions as
          arguments and creates bar, pie, line, and scattered point plots of the
          information selected. Plots can be displayed on Digital Equipment Cor-
          poration Graphics terminals such as the VT340 (refer to the OPTIONAL
          HARDWARE section for a list of specific supported terminals). Hard copy
          can be obtained from terminals by attaching a DIGITAL device which sup-
          ports the SIXEL protocol (for example, LA50, LA75). For users with DECwin-
          dows, graphics can be displayed in DECterm windows.

          The DATATRIEVE Client for Windows can display, process, modify, print
          plots created by the plot statement, and export the plot using the clip-
          board to other applications. Printing to postscript printers is also
          supported.

          Compatibility

          DIGITAL DATATRIEVE for OpenVMS VAX systems and DIGITAL DATATRIEVE for
          OpenVMS Alpha systems are highly compatible, with the exception of the
          support for floating point definitions, typical of the Alpha platform.

          DIGITAL DATATRIEVE is largely upward compatible from DATATRIEVE-11.
          DATATRIEVE-11 provides a utility that extracts the contents of a DATATRIEVE-11
          dictionary in a format to be entered into Oracle CDD/Repository for
          OpenVMS. Some syntactic and semantic differences do exist between DATATRIEVE-11
          and DIGITAL DATATRIEVE. Procedures copied with the EXTRACT utility can
          require modification.

          DIGITAL DATATRIEVE Version 7.2 for OpenVMS VAX SystemsSPD 24.44.31


          Other Hardware Required:

          Mass storage with a minimum of 25,000 disk blocks for DIGITAL DATA-
          TRIEVE system software for VAX Systems.

          Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1)

          Disk space required for      18,000 blocks
          installation:
                                       (15.3 Mbytes)

          Disk space required for      20,000 blocks
          use (permanent):
                                       (10.2 Mbytes)

          These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
          sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
          system environment, configuration, and software options.

          Memory Requirements for DECwindows Support

          The minimum supported memory for this application running in a stan-
          dalone DECwindows environment with both the client and server execut-
          ing on that same system is 8M bytes.

          The performance and memory usage of DECwindows applications are par-
          ticularly sensitive to system configuration. Less memory may be re-
          quired on the client system (the system where the software is installed
          and executed) if the server (the component that displays the appli-
          cation) resides on another system. More memory may be required on a
          system with several applications running, or where it may be desir-
          able to improve the performance of an application.

          OPTIONAL HARDWARE

          Graphics can be displayed on VT125, VT240, VT241, VT330, and VT340 ter-
          minals only. For users with DECwindows, graphics can be displayed in
          DECterm windows.
