 

 DESCRIPTION

 Sequential Media Filesystem (SMF) for OpenVMS is a layered software
 product that provides an advanced tape file system that is integrated
 into OpenVMS. SMF makes using low-cost tape media almost as easy and
 convenient as using disk media.

 Using SMF, users access and manipulate files stored on magnetic tape
 using standard OpenVMS utilities (such as DIRECTORY and COPY) and through
 user-written applications that use RMS or OpenVMS high-level language
 run-time library I/O routines. Data is read directly from and writ-
 ten directly to an SMF device. In other words, access to data stored
 on tape does not need to be staged on disk.

 SMF stores file attributes and directory entry information (metadata)
 in an online Relational Data Base (Rdb) database. The Rdb entries con-
 tain the equivalent of the Files-11 ODS-2 standard OpenVMS directory
 and file header information. By storing directory and file header in-
 formation in an online database, SMF supports operations such as file
 deletion and renaming which modify the file's metadata without need-
 ing to access the data stored on the tape. Furthermore, SMF files can
 be cataloged in hierarchical directories with a full set of disk-like
 file attributes.

 Applications for which SMF is well-suited are characterized by large
 files that are accessed sequentially and situations in which it is not
 cost-effective to store the files on disk. Typical applications where
 SMF allows dramatic reduction in storage costs include:

 o  Scientific applications, such as the analysis of high-energy physics
    data

 o  Industry applications, such as seismic exploration data in the oil
    and gas industry and telemetry data in the aerospace industry

 o  Traditional main-frame business applications, such as payroll

 o  Documentation applications, such as those that use large PostScript
    [R] files or multimedia data files

                                                          April 1997

                                                        AE-QDKUBD-TE

 

 o  Manufacturing applications, such as those that require archiving
    of large, regulated data files

 o  Miscellaneous applications, such as those that access genealogi-
    cal data and other historical data

 SMF uses the media management capabilities in Media and Device Man-
 agement Services for OpenVMS (MDMS) to automatically load and unload
 media. MDMS provides SMF the ability to share media and devices, in-
 cluding robotically-controlled loaders and media pools, with other ap-
 plications, such as Archive/Backup System for OpenVMS (ABS) software.

 Features

 To meet your storage management requirements, SMF for OpenVMS provides
 the following features:

 o  Operates as an integrated part of OpenVMS (Version 6.1, 6.2 or 7.1
    required for VAX; Version 6.2 or 7.1 required for Alpha)

 o  Provides disk-file-like security (UIC-based file ownership, SOGW
    protection masks, ACL's, and auditing) for files stored on tape

 o  Provides rapid access to file header information through an online
    database

 o  Tracks where files are stored on tape

 o  Minimizes tape mounts by doing directory and file-header operations
    with the online database

 o  Allows multiple users to query tape directories and headers simul-
    taneously

 o  Performs the necessary tape mounts and dismounts automatically and
    transparently whenever a user or application reads or writes SMF
    tape file data

 o  Complies with the ANSI X3.27 standard for on-tape format

 o  Provides a mechanism for importing files from legacy ANSI X3.27 tapes

 o  Provides a mechanism for recovering the space occupied by deleted
    tape files

                                  2

 

 o  Provides network file access through the DECnet File Access Lis-
    tener (FAL)

 o  Reduces backup time, because regular backup operations only need
    to save the file header information contained in the online database
    and do not need to save the file contents.

 Software Restrictions

 Because SMF provides direct access to tape devices, the following re-
 strictions apply:

 o  SMF does not allow nonsequential access to files stored on tape.

 o  SMF files must be opened for exclusive access.

 o  Opening an SMF file locks the file, its associated volume, and the
    device.

 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

 SMF supports the VAX and Alpha processors that OpenVMS supports. For
 a detailed list of VAX processors supported by OpenVMS, see the Open-
 VMS VAX Operating System Software Product Description (SPD 25.01.xx).

 OpenVMS Alpha Operating System Software Product Description (SPD 41.87.xx).

 As with OpenVMS, the following processors are not supported:

    MicroVAX I

    VAXstation 8000

 Processor Restrictions

 The MicroVAX 2000 and VAXstation 2000 systems require a TK50[TM] for
 a load device.

 DEVICE SUPPORT TABLES

 SMF supports a large array of storage devices, ranging from single-
 tape drives to automated optical and tape jukeboxes, through the Me-
 dia and Device Management Services (MDMS) software. Tables 1 and 2 list
 the devices SMF supports with the specified adapter/controllers. Items
 marked with a V are supported on VAX systems; those with an A are sup-
 ported on Alpha systems; those with an X are supported on both. Sup-
 port for any particular device and adapter/controller configuration
 is subject to the controller and operating system SPDs. Table 3 de-
 scribes the adapters/controllers.

 The tables identify devices by Digital-known identifiers. If you use
 third-party products that contain Digital drives, those drives are shown
 in the tables under the Digital name.

 If you have devices not identified as supported on the list, SMF may
 still support them. Digital continually tests its software on addi-
 tional devices that may not have been added to this list. If you have
 a question about a particular device, contact Digital customer sup-
 port.
