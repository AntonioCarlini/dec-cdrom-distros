    PRODUCT NAME: TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 OpenVMS Alpha        SPD: 33.75.03
                                and OpenVMS VAX V1.3


    DESCRIPTION

    TeamRoute is an  electronic document initiation,  routing, approval,  and
    tracking system. It works between members of an organization  distributed
    across  wide-area  and/or   local-area  networks.  It   is  designed   to
    accommodate the  primary attributes  of paper-based  document  processing
    systems with the added  flexibility, security, and efficiency  common  to
    electronic processing systems. The design considers the diverse and ever-
    changing needs of an organization's administrative systems.

    TeamRoute uses the  master routing package  as the model  for  gathering,
    disseminating, processing, and presenting information.  It allows an  end
    user to select  a template  from  a  library of  templates, create a  new
    routing package  from that  template,  specify  the routing  list,  enter
    information into applicable fields, attach any relevant information,  and
    route the master routing  package and any attachments  to users or  other
    applications for processing and/or approval/disapproval.

    TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 supports interaction  among a heterogeneous  group
    of clients and  among multiple server  domains. Microsoft‚  Windows‰  and
    Apple‚Macintosh‚ clients are  supported using the  TeamLinks V2.*  client
    software (SPD  55.49 for  Windows and  SPD 39.62  for Macintosh)  or  the
    TeamLinks Office  Package  (SPD  37.36  for  Windows  and  SPD 48.17  for
    Macintosh),  Video  Terminals  (VTs)  are  supported  by  the   TeamRoute
    ALL-IN-1 client hosted by ALL-IN-1. 

    A new Server-only  licensing option enables  the TeamRoute server  to  be
    installed on  any country  specific version  of ALL-IN-1  in  support  of
    TeamLinks  TeamRoute  clients  without  the   need  for  local   language
    translation. TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 V1.3 requires ALL-IN-1 Version 3.1 as
    the minimum version on VAX and Alpha.

    TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 is accessible as a separate subsystem of ALL-IN-1.
    Routing packages are received, filed, and  organized in a separate  inbox
    within the user's File  Cabinet. The VT user  chooses TeamRoute from  the
    ALL-IN-1 main menu to enter the system. TeamLinks users gain access by  a
    button on the button  bar or via the  TeamRoute icon. TeamRoute  utilises
    ALL-IN-1 nicknames if appropriate to the user_s style of working.


                                                                January 1995
                                                                 AE-PKNRD-TK

    TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 OpenVMS Alpha and VAX V1.3   SPD:33.75.03


    TeamRoute allows  routing  of  documents within  departmental  local-area
    networks, and across wide-area,  store-and-forward networks by  utilizing
    Digital's ALL-IN-1 Electronic Mail and MAILbus 1 products such as Message
    Router.

    Features

    API

    A public Application Programming Interface  (API), which allows users  to
    create linkages with new and existing applications, is documented in  the
    TeamRoute Programming Guide.

    Templates

    Master  routing  packages   are  produced  from   modifiable   templates.
    Modifiable templates  and  routing  package  ownership  allows  users  to
    stipulate routing  policies and  receipt  actions  for a  master  routing
    package.

    Sample Applications

    TeamRoute provides several sample applications in the form of pre-defined
    templates. These  sample  applications  demonstrate the  capabilities  of
    TeamRoute and can  be used by  users with or  without modifications.  The
    sample applications  include:  Action  Item,  Document  Review, Read  and
    Acknowledge, Telephone Call Slip, Account Request, Meeting Notice, Ask  a
    Question, and Travel Request.

    Routing Packages

    A routing package  is the object  that is created  by the  initiator  and
    routed to recipients. It is created  by selecting a template and  filling
    out the routing  list, adding attachments,  and signing it.  The  routing
    package at  this  point  becomes  the  "Master"  and  is  stored  in  the
    initiator's File  Cabinet on  the  server.  Routing  copies  are sent  to
    recipients who can  add attachments  or  modify the routing  list  of the
    master copy. Recipients can save their copies in their own personal  File
    Cabinets. The master gets updated throughout the lifecycle of the routing
    package.


    User Roles and Policies

    During the lifecycle of a routing  package, all participants play one  or
    more specified roles. For example, a user may be an approver at one  step
    and a carbon copy (cc:) recipient at another step. Roles are assigned  by
    the routing package initiator or template designer. Roles are defined  by
    a set of rights (what a user can do), requirements (what a user must do),
    and optionally, the name of an application to invoke.

    Routing Package Tracking

    Tracking can be requested for any routing package stored in a user's File
    Cabinet. When tracking is requested, the  Server sends a new carbon  copy
    of the master in its current state.

    A routing package's history is used  to monitor its progress. The  events
    logged in  the  routing  package  history  include:  when  signatures are
    applied, if the  application was  run,  when copies were  sent,  and when
    updates were applied.

    Routing

    Routing is defined by a routing  list. The Server sends routing  packages
    according to  the position  of the  recipients in  the routing  list.  It
    updates the master when it receives a revised copy from a recipient,  and
    then sends a new copy to the next recipient on the list.

    The routing  list is  created by  the routing  package initiator  or  the
    template designer. However, the path a  routing package takes during  its
    lifecycle may differ from the one specified in the original routing  list
    because someone  along the  way may  modify it.  Serial  and  carbon-copy
    parallel routing are both available.

    Attachments

    An attachment is any additional file or document that is routed with  the
    master routing package. When a file  or document is attached, the  server
    marks that attachment with the name of the user adding the attachment, an
    attachment ID, the  date and time  of addition, a  user-provided  subject
    label, attachment,  data  type,  and file  name.  The  date and  time  of
    addition is the local date and time.

    Signatures

    Signatures is  a  password-protected  function that  indicates  approval,
    disapproval, or acknowledgment of a routing package. If an attachment  is
    subsequently removed or a key field value altered, the signature  becomes
    invalid.

    When users sign a  routing package, TeamRoute adds  their name, the  date
    and time, any added remarks, and the approval action. Recipients  viewing
    signatures are shown whether the signature remains valid.

    Help

    Users can  get  help  for TeamRoute  by  using  the Help  facility.  Help
    provides basic information  on how to  perform the function  in  question
    without the user having to reference the documentation.

    Printing

    TeamRoute takes  advantage of  the printing  facilities provided  by  the
    underlying ALL-IN-1 system. The user can specify the printer  destination
    and options.

    Editing

    TeamRoute allows the VT user to specify their editor of choice  supported
    by ALL-IN-1 Electronic Mail.

    TeamLinks users  may specify  their wordprocessor  of choice  from  those
    installed on their PC.

    System Management

    TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 provides a  separate management utility.  Invoking
    these utilities allows  cluster-wide system management  operations to  be
    managed centrally.

    There are no special utilities to  run for File Cabinet maintenance.  One
    or all  user areas  on the  Server can  be backed  up or  restored  using
    standard OpenVMS utilities.

    Internationalization

    TeamRoute is  designed to  support multi-lingual  operations. It  can  be
    deployed  in  a  multi-lingual  network  and  can  support  multi-lingual
    operations on a single server system. For more information, contact  your
    local Digital office.

    Documentation

    Documentation of the  installation, system management,  programming,  and
    user procedures is included with the individual kits.
