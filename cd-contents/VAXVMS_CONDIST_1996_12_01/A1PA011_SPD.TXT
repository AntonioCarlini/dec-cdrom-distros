 PRODUCT NAME:  ALL-IN-1 Personal Assistant, Version 1.1         SPD
 37.53.01

 DESCRIPTION

 ALL-IN-1 Personal Assistant is a product which is layered on top of
 ALL-IN-1 IOS for OpenVMS, V3.0 systems.

 ALL-IN-1 IOS is a customizable, menu-oriented software product that
 provides generic office applications and a facility for integrating
 other business-oriented applications. ALL-IN-1 IOS unifies these ap-
 plications into an easy-to-use, menu-driven information system.

 Through ALL-IN-1 IOS's electronic mail and links into Digital Equip-
 ment Corporation's networking facilities, users can transport or re-
 ceive information that has been created on desktop, departmental, and
 corporate systems.

 ALL-IN-1 Personal Assistant enables users to track new ALL-IN-1 mes-
 sages and file them, using a variety of selection criteria, in fold-
 ers within any of the drawers available to the user in ALL-IN-1 V3.0.
 Use ALL-IN-1 Personal Assistant if receiving large amounts of mail or
 maintaining large numbers of documents.

 The ALL-IN-1 Personal Assistant is an add-on subsystem to the stan-
 dard ALL-IN-1 IOS product. ALL-IN-1 Personal Assistant extends ALL-IN-1
 with a set of additional text searching and filtering functions. Ad-
 ditional forms are provided to assist users in dealing with the new
 capabilities.

 ALL-IN-1 Personal Assistant helps the user deal with information by
 providing three sets of facilities: Standard Operations, Rule Spec-
 ification, and scheduling of the application of rules to file cabi-
 net documents.

 Standard Operations

 A standard part of ALL-IN-1 Personal Assistant provides users a way
 to manipulate messages arriving in the INBOX folder. It allows the user
 to be aware of high-priority messages, messages sent by a provided list
 of managers, and "watch" messages based on user-defined addressees.


 Rule Specification

 The user directs the ALL-IN-1 Personal Assistant to take certain spec-
 ified actions through specifying rules. Rules are simple conditional
 statements. These IF ... THEN statements are entered by the user through
 a set of forms provided as part of ALL-IN-1 Personal Assistant. Nat-
 ural language phrases are provided by the user to direct ALL-IN-1 Per-
 sonal Assistant to act on the various attributes of documents in the
 ALL-IN-1 file cabinet.


 Applying Rules

 The rules are grouped into logical sets called rule sets. ALL-IN-1 Per-
 sonal Assistant then schedules the rule sets to be applied to the var-
 ious folders within the users ALL-IN-1 file cabinet at predetermined
 intervals during the day. The availability of ALL-IN-1 Personal As-
 sistant is determined by the ALL-IN-1 system manager.

 A single rule may be part of several different rule sets. Rule sets
 may be set to inactive and stored for later use. Rule sets can be tested
 before they are used. Tests show what will happen, but do not take any
 action.

 The ALL-IN-1 Personal Assistant provides each user with an activity
 reporting facility which summarizes the user's rule set activities Sys-
 tem Management Section.

 System Management

 The ALL-IN-1 Personal Assistant provides a management facility so the
 ALL-IN-1 system manager can track and manage users' rule sets. The ALL-IN-1
 Personal Assistant allows the ALL-IN-1 system manager to control op-
 erational hours so as not to interfere with the operation of ALL-IN-1
 housekeeping procedures.

 erations. This support is subject to availability of the specific trans-
