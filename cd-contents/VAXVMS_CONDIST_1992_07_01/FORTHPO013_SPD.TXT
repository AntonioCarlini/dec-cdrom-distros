           PRODUCT NAME:  VAX FORTRAN High-Performance Option,   SPD
           32.67.03                Version 1.2

           DESCRIPTION

           The VAX FORTRAN High-Performance Option (HPO) is an optional
           enhancement to the VAX FORTRAN compiler. HPO enables the FOR-
           TRAN compiler to automatically generate vector-processor in-
           structions and to automatically decompose programs to im-
           prove performance on multiple-processor systems.

           HPO adds a new ASSERT statement that provides additional in-
           formation to the compiler about the program. The ASSERT state-
           ment can be used in some programs to achieve a high degree
           of vectorization and/or automatic decomposition. The ASSERT
           statement can optionally generate code to verify the asser-
           tions at run-time, if desired. ASSERT statements can be spec-
           ified in directive form for portability and will be ignored
           by other compilers since they will appear as comments.

           HPO also adds the INIT_DEP_FWD directive to allow vector pro-
           cessing for many loops that would otherwise not qualify due
           to unknown data dependences. As this directive may change
           the meaning of the program, Digital Equipment Corporation
           does not warrant execution results conforming to the FOR-
           TRAN standard when this directive is used.

           Additional Features

           o  Optimized vector code generation for solving dense sys-
              tems of linear equations

           o  The /MATH_LIBRARY qualifier to support performance op-
              timized vector math functions

           Version 1.2

           o  The /CHECK=ALIGNMENT qualifier to suppress vector align-
              ment exceptions at run-time

           o  The NOVECTOR directive to allow the programmer to con-
              trol the presence and level of vectorization in each nest
              of DO-loops

           HPO includes the following enhancements to
           VAX FORTRAN:

           o  Thorough dependence analysis

           o  Automatic transformations for vectorizing difficult con-
              structs

           o  Multi-level vectorization and decomposition

           o  Compile-time performance analysis to choose the best vec-
              torization and/or decomposition method

           o  Integration of vector and scalar optimizations

           o  Generation of diagnostics for vectorization inhibitors

              -  Though some vector inhibition diagnostics will dis-
                 play in the listing and on the termainal, the VAX Language-
                 Sensitive Editor component of the VAX Language-Sensitive
                 Editor/Source Code Analyzer is required to display all
                 the vector inhibition diagnostics generated by the com-
                 piler.

           o  Loop summary listing for viewing optimization results

           HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

           VAX, MicroVAX, VAXstation, or VAXserver configuration as spec-
           ified in the System Support Addendum (SSA 32.67.03-x).
