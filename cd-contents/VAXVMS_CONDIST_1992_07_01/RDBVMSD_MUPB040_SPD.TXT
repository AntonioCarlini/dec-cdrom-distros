 PRODUCT NAME:  VAX Rdb/VMS, Version 4.0                SPD 25.59.13
                Relational Database Management System

 DESCRIPTION

 VAX Rdb/VMS is a full-function, SQL-based relational database manage-
 ment system designed for the VMS Operating System. It is intended for
 general purpose, multi-user, centralized or distributed applications.

 VAX Rdb/VMS supports a complete set of languages, utilities, and pre-
 compilers that enable users to maintain and manipulate databases. VAX
 Rdb/VMS implements ANSI/ISO SQL as its standard interface to the database.

 VAX Rdb/VMS also includes SQL/Services, a client/server protocol that
 provides remote access to VAX Rdb/VMS databases from various desktop
 platforms.

 Features

 Data Definition Language (DDL)

 Users can issue DDL statements through the interactive SQL and RDO util-
 ities, the SQL precompilers, or the SQL module language in order to
 accomplish the following:

 o  Create schemas (database), tables (relations), views, columns (fields),
    domains (global fields), and indexes (both ascending and descend-
    ing)

 o  Create storage areas for tables and indexes

 o  Define constraints in table definitions

 o  Define triggers for table definitions

 o  Grant and revoke access rights to schemas, tables, views and columns

 o  Alter definitions of tables, columns, storage areas, and access rights

                               DIGITAL                 February 1992

                                                         AE-DA11N-TE

 

 o  Delete definitions of tables, views, columns, indexes, constraints,
    triggers, storage areas, and access rights

 o  Restructure schemas on-line, without unload/reload

 o  Add comments to definitions of domains, tables, views, columns, and
    indexes

 o  Define collating sequences for international character sets

 Data Manipulation Language (DML)

 Users can issue DML statements through all interactive, precompiler,
 and module language interfaces to accomplish the following:

 o  Perform standard data manipulation operations: insert, select, up-
    date, and delete

 o  Perform standard relational operations: select, join, union (SQL
    only) and project

 o  Access multiple databases in the same program

 o  Used with DECdtm software, perform coordinated data manipulation
    operations across multiple databases (Two Phase Commit)

 o  Manipulate data using:

    -  Precompiled SQL or RDO DML statements embedded in high-level lan-
       guage programs

    -  Compiled DML statements written in SQL module language and called
       from any 3GL language that complies with the VMS calling stan-
       dards

    -  Dynamically executed SQL statements accepted or generated at pro-
       gram run-time

    -  Interactive SQL or RDO DML statements.

    -  RDO statements called from high-level language programs

 o  Optimize queries automatically, using:

    o  Index selection on one or more columns in a table

                                  2

 

    o  Join order

    o  Join by sort/merge

 o  Perform atomic transactions completed by commit or rollback

 Database Utilities

 o  Logical import/export, for migrating data and/or metadata to an-
    other Rdb database

 o  On-line backup/restore, both incremental and full at the database
    or storage area level

 o  Database verify utility to check and verify integrity of data struc-
    tures in the database

 o  Analysis utility for analyzing database page usage, space usage by
    tables and space usage and number of levels of indexes

 o  Statistical utility for performance monitoring and database dump
    utility for database analysis

 o  Load/unload utility which can operate on each table

 o  ALTER utility for modifying the contents of corrupted database stor-
    age areas. (This function is not recommended or required for nor-
    mal use.)

 Interactive Utilities: SQL and RDO

 o  Support all data manipulation operations: insert, select, update,
    and delete

 o  Provide online help for features, language syntax, and errors

 o  Allow interactive editing of previous commands

 o  Provide SHOW facility to display database and session character-
    istics

 o  RDO statements can be included in programs, using the Callable RDO
    facility

                                  3

 

 o  SQL supports the use of LSE templates to assist in entering syn-
    tactically correct statements

 Concurrency and Integrity Controls

 Concurrency

 o  Full concurrent access (storage, retrieval, update, and deletion)
    in a multi-user environment

 o  Multiple applications can access the same database concurrently

 o  Optional read-only (snapshot) mode for increased concurrency in large
    retrieval and report writing applications. When a read-only trans-
    action is started, the operations do not lock out other users.

 Integrity

 o  Validity checking at the column level

 o  Referential integrity through column constraint checking from one
    or more tables

 o  Rollback of failed transactions, both automatic and program-controlled

 o  Recovery-unit journaling with transaction rollback recovery

 o  After-image journaling with rollforward recovery

 o  Triggers: execution of one or more actions when certain database
    conditions are met

 Security

 o  Database file protected by VMS file protection

 o  Rights to perform database operations are kept in a set of Access
    Control Lists (ACLs) associated with entities in the database. ACLs
    are stored in the database and maintained by the owner of the database.
    ACLs can be updated at any time.

 o  Access Control Lists govern access to:

    -  Tables

                                  4

 

    -  Views

    -  Data definitions

    -  Data manipulation operations

    -  Database utility operations

 o  Logging facility to log all database access requests.

 Languages

 o  Precompiler support - The SQL precompiler supports an optional FIPS
    flagger, allowing the user to identify SQL statements which are not
    in the current ANSI/ISO SQL standard.

 o  Module Language - SQL statements can be grouped into modules and
    linked with any language that uses the VMS calling standard using
    the module language processor. The SQL Module language also sup-
    ports the FIPS flagger option.

 o  Dynamic SQL - Access through the SQL Dynamic Interface for all lan-
    guages that support the VMS calling standard, although only pro-
    grams written in VAX PL/I, VAX Ada and VAX C can use the full power

                                  5

 

    of dynamic SQL, because these languages have built-in dynamic mem-
    ory handling capabilities.

 o  Callable RDO - Access through Callable RDO for all languages that
    support the VMS calling standard.

 o  SQL/Services VMS client applications can be written in any language
    that supports the VMS calling standard. MS-DOS[R] and OS/2[TM] client
    applications can be written in any language that supports the Mi-
    crosoft[R] C calling standard. ULTRIX client applications should be
    written in portable C. Macintosh[TM] client applications can be writ-
    ten in MPW[TM] C.

 Physical Storage Characteristics

 o  Data in the database is kept either in a single file or distributed
    between multiple files across a single or multiple volumes. Each
    database storage area (file) has an accompanying file which may be
    used during read-only "snapshot" operations.

    -  A single file database can span multiple disk volumes when it
       exceeds the storage capacity of a single disk structure.

    -  The multifile database feature allows the database to be dis-
       tributed among multiple volumes on the same node or cluster per
       user specification.

 o  A storage area may be defined as read-only

 o  Table structure

    -  Duplicate rows can be eliminated

    -  No required ordering of columns on storage or retrieval

 o  Storage structure

    -  B-Tree (sorted in ascending or descending order) or hash indexes
       on tables

    -  Periodic reorganization of database is NOT required

 o  Data types

    -  ASCII text (1-32767 bytes)

                                  6

 

    -  Varying string (1-32767 bytes)

    -  Date

    -  Signed byte (1 byte)

    -  Signed word (16-bit) integer

    -  Signed longword (32-bit) integer

    -  Signed quadword (64-bit) integer

    -  Single precision floating point (F_floating)

    -  Double precision floating point (G_floating)

    -  List cursors (Segmented strings) for storing large amounts of
       unstructured data, such as documents, voice, or graphics SQL/Services
       supports the following data types only:

    -  ASCIZ - Null terminated ASCII string used to represent all strings,
       numeric values and dates.

    -  VARCHAR - Signed word integer followed by an array of 8-bit bytes
       used to store any type of data, including binary. The maximum
       number of bytes in a VARCHAR data item is 16383.

    -  List cursors (Segmented strings)

 Remote Database Access

 o  Application programs developed to access VAX Rdb/VMS databases and
    running under VMS on a given node in a DECnet network can:

    -  Access VAX Rdb/VMS databases on the same node

    -  Access VAX Rdb/VMS databases on other nodes in the network

 o  SQL/Services provides remote access to VAX Rdb/VMS databases. Ap-
    plication programs interface to VAX SQL/Services through an Appli-
    cation Programming Interface (API) set of callable routines. These
    routines communicate via DECnet with the target database through
    the VAX SQL/Services server process residing on the VMS system. The

                                  7

 

    VMS server can also work with the RdbAccess data access products
    to retrieve data from other systems.
    Client application programming libraries are provided for VMS, UL-
    TRIX, MS-DOS, OS/2 and Macintosh.

 Data Dictionary

 o  Stores data definitions in the database file itself, in the form
    of tables

 o  Allows on-line retrieval of data definitions

 o  Allows modification of data definitions using interactive data def-
    inition language

 o  Allows storage of data definitions in the VAX Common Data Dictio-
    nary/Plus. The VAX CDD/Plus is optional but recommended. Using VAX CDD/Plus
    to store definitions in a dictionary for an Rdb/VMS database al-
    lows users to:

    -  Define fields and relations in the database based on dictionary
       definitions

    -  Share standard definitions among several databases

    -  Analyze the impact of changing shared definitions
       Sharing common dictionary definitions provides consistency of
       definitions across the database and other software products as
       users develop an application.

 VAXcluster/Local Area VAXcluster

 o  VAX Rdb/VMS in a VAXcluster environment allows concurrent, multiple-
    processor database access. VAX Rdb/VMS automatically recovers the
    database if a processor in the VAXcluster fails and provides op-
    tional after-image journaling to further protect the integrity of
    the VAXcluster database.

 o  VAX Rdb/VMS uses the VMS distributed lock manager to synchronize
    cluster-wide updates to the database root file, to initiate the au-
    tomatic recovery process when a node fails, and to coordinate con-
    current updates to the same database from processes running on dif-
    ferent nodes.

 o  VAXclusters offer higher availability to VAX Rdb/VMS databases in
    a properly configured VAXcluster environment.

 Distributed Database Environment

 Installation of the VAX Data Distributor optional layered product with
 Rdb/VMS provides:

 o  Extraction of entire databases or parts of them, into target databases
    on remote systems.

 o  Extraction rollup, which is similar to extraction, with the addi-
    tional capability of extracting relations and fields from multi-
    ple source databases into a single, new target database.

 o  Store and forward replication. Once a target database has been cre-
    ated, updates to the source database are forwarded to the target
    database(s) at scheduled intervals or on demand.

 Limits and Parameters

 o  Maximum number of relations and views in a database: The recommended
    limit is 4096, however the practical limit will vary according to
    the complexity of the database, especially the number of views, in-
    dices and other logical areas contained in the database. Metadata
    volatility can also affect this limit.

 o  Maximum number of bytes in a record: 65,271

                                  9

 

 o  Maximum number of fields in a relation: 2000

 o  Maximum index key size: 254

 o  Maximum length of a database object name: 31 characters

 o  Minimum database page size: 512 bytes

 o  Maximum size of database file: limited by available physical de-
    vices

 o  Maximum number of database attaches: 2032
