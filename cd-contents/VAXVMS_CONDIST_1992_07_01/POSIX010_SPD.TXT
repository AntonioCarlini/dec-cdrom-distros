 PRODUCT NAME:  VMS POSIX, Version 1.0                  SPD 34.82.00

 DESCRIPTION

 POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface for Computing Environments)
 is a set of standards and draft standards that have been generated by
 the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) and sup-
 ported by organizations such as the International Organization for Stan-
 dardization (ISO). POSIX defines a set of interface standards for var-
 ious parts of an operating system. Because of the consistency they af-
 ford applications at the operating system level, the POSIX standards
 are an essential underpinning of open systems computing environments.

 VMS POSIX is one of Digital Equipment Corporation's responses as a soft-
 ware vendor to the industry POSIX effort, and is a cornerstone of VMS
 open systems capabilities. (Digital's ULTRIX and VAXELN systems also
 offer support for POSIX standards.) VMS POSIX provides the capabil-
 ity on VMS to develop and run applications conforming to the POSIX stan-
 dards.

 VMS POSIX includes support for the standards and draft standards for
 the system application programming interface (POSIX 1003.1), shell and
 utilities (1003.2), and real-time programming (1003.4). POSIX 1003.1
 has been approved as a final standard. POSIX 1003.2 and 1003.4 are ma-
 ture drafts that are currently being considered and evaluated by the
 standards community. (For a listing of the specific standards supported
 by VMS POSIX, refer to the VMS POSIX Supported Standards (Components)
 section.)

 User Environments:

 o  Program Development Environment

    The program development environment for VMS POSIX allows the use
    of tools from both the VMS development environment and the POSIX
    environment. Program developers who choose to work at DCL level can
    use the VMS program development environment tools, including the
    VAX C compiler, the VMS Linker, and VMS Debugger, as well as ap-
    plication building tools included in VAXset. Program developers who
    choose to work at the VMS POSIX shell level can use the POSIX en-
    vironment defined in P1003.2, including "c89" (for linking and com-
    piling programs), "make" (for building applications), and "ar" (for
    archiving library entries).

 o  Interactive User Environment

    The interactive user environment for VMS POSIX provides the user
    with a set of UNIX[R]-like commands and utilities that include func-
    tions similar to DCL (the command "ls" is equivalent to the DCL com-
    mand, "DIRECTORY"), in addition to functions unavailable in the DCL
    environment.

 o  End User Environment (Running POSIX Programs)

    VMS POSIX programs are run from either DCL level or the VMS POSIX
    shell. A captive account can also be created, in which a user who
    accesses the system is limited to running one or more POSIX appli-
    cations.

 POSIX Standards:

 o  POSIX 1003.1

    POSIX 1003.1 is an approved standard, adopted by the IEEE and en-
    dorsed by X/Open, ANSI, and ISO. It is the standard most commonly
    supported by system vendors today.

    POSIX 1003.1 defines a standard for basic system services on an op-
    erating system, and describes how system services can be used by
    POSIX applications. These services allow an application to perform

                                  2

 

    operations such as process creation and execution, file system ac-
    cess, and I/O device management.

 o  POSIX 1003.2

    POSIX 1003.2 is not yet a formal standard, but close to formal ap-
    proval. It provides both a callable and interactive interface to
    shell and utility services.

    The 1003.2-based interactive interface to VMS POSIX is a set of UNIX-
    like commands and utilities. The VMS POSIX command language inter-
    preter (shell) has many of the functions and features of the Korn
    Shell. These commands and utilities include those that provide func-
    tions similar to DCL (the command "ls" is equivalent to the DCL com-
    mand, "DIRECTORY"), in addition to functions unavailable in the DCL
    environment. For example, the VMS POSIX shell supports the func-
    tion of "pipes," which allow the output of one command to become
    the input of a subsequent command. The VMS POSIX interactive in-
    terface also includes a group of complex utilities (such as "lex",
    "yacc", and "awk"), C programming utilities, and a text editor ("vi").

    VMS POSIX 1003.2 support also includes a set of callable interfaces
    for executing shell commands, compiling and executing regular ex-
    pressions, and performing pattern matching.

 o  POSIX 1003.4

    VMS POSIX also implements Draft 9 of the POSIX 1003.4 Standard for
    Real-time Extensions. For applications that have real-time comput-
    ing requirements, these extensions provide support for such func-
    tions as enhanced interprocess communication, scheduling and mem-
    ory management control, and asynchronous I/O operations.

 VMS POSIX Supported Standards (Components):

 The following list summarizes the formal and draft POSIX standards im-
 plemented by VMS POSIX:

 o  POSIX IEEE Std. 1003.1-1988 (NIST, FIPS 151-1)

 o  POSIX IEEE Std. 1003.1-1990 (ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990(E))

                                  3

 

 o  Portions of POSIX 1003.1a, Draft 5 and symbolic links and associ-
    ated functions (symlink, readlink, and so on) from P1003.1a Draft
    4

 o  Callable functions from POSIX 1003.2, Draft 10, Appendix B

 o  Shell and Utilities from POSIX 1003.2, Draft 10 and POSIX 1003.2a,
    Draft 5

 o  POSIX 1003.4, Draft 9, except for direct (non-buffered) I/O, DAT-
    LOCK, and TXTLOCK for memory locking, and executable access to shared
    memory

 VMS POSIX Supported Utilities:

 VMS POSIX includes support for the following POSIX 1003.2 utilities:

 o  All of the "Mandatory" utilities

 o  Software Development Utilities, "make" and "ar"

 o  C Development Utilities, "c89", "yacc", and "lex"

 o  FORTRAN "asa" Development Utility

 o  Shell extensions and some utilities from the User Portability Ex-
    tension (UPE), 1003.2a

 VMS POSIX Support for Draft Standards:

 POSIX is comprised of a number of standards. The only formal standards
 to date are POSIX 1003.1 for basic system interfaces and POSIX 1003.3.1,
 the test assertions a vendor must test to claim conformance to POSIX
 1003.1. Draft standards, such as POSIX 1003.2 and POSIX 1003.4, which
 are implemented in VMS POSIX, are not formal standards. They are work-
 ing documents that will evolve over time before becoming final stan-
 dards.

 VMS POSIX implements the draft standards for POSIX 1003.2 (Draft 10)
 and POSIX 1003.4 (Draft 9) to allow customers to start to use and be-
 come familiar with these standards in advance of formal standards ap-
 proval.

 As VMS POSIX adds support for evolving and final standards, customers
 may want to modify their POSIX applications to conform to the latest
 version of these standards. To assist customers in migrating to fu-
 ture versions, the VMS POSIX documentation will include information
 describing the differences between releases.

 It should be noted that because Draft standards are working documents
 and not formal standards, Digital will support the use of a given draft
 standard only until the functionality provided by that draft is su-
 perseded in a new version of VMS POSIX. Draft standards are contin-
 ually evolving, often in an incompatible way, and are often too un-
 stable for Digital to offer the levels of backward compatibility and
 formal support for older versions to which VMS customers are accus-
 tomed.

 POSIX Conformance and Certification:

 VMS POSIX conforms to both the POSIX 1003.1-1990 standard as speci-
 fied by ISO/IEC 9945-1, and the 1003.1-1988 version of the POSIX stan-
 dard. The POSIX standard requires that suppliers who claim conformance
 provide a conformance document that describes how the supplier imple-
 ments the standard. This is the only proof of conformance required by
 the IEEE.

 POSIX 1003.1 is the only POSIX standard for which any kind of veri-
 fication exists. (Because POSIX 1003.2 and 1003.4 are draft standards,
 there is no formal method of testing conformance.)

 In the United States, the National Institute of Standards and Tech-
 nology (NIST) has developed a test suite, called the POSIX Conformance
 Test Suite or PCTS. The PCTS tests for conformance to NIST's Federal
 Information Processing Standard (FIPS 151-1), which is based on POSIX
 1003.1-1988. VMS POSIX conforms to the POSIX 1003.1-1988 standard as
 required by the FIP 151-1.

 VMS POSIX has been tested and granted a certificate of validation for
 FIPS 151-1 by NIST.
