          PRODUCT NAME:  VAX DEC/Test Manager, Version 3.2    SPD 26.68.09

          DESCRIPTION

          VAX DEC/Test Manager automates regression testing by executing
          user-supplied tests and automatically comparing the results with
          the expected test results. VAX DEC/Test Manager gives the soft-
          ware engineer flexibility in organizing tests, selecting tests
          for execution, and verifying and reviewing test results. Batch
          applications and interactive applications which input and output
          text to character cell terminals or DECwindows applications on
          VMS can be tested using VAX DEC/Test Manager.

          VAX DEC/Test Manager supports the DECwindows software envi-
          ronment and provides either a DECwindows or command line user
          interface. VAX DEC/Test Manager is included in the VAXset Soft-
          ware Engineering Tools Package. This package provides simplified
          ordering and maintenance of various tools. Refer to the VAXset
          Package Software Product Description (SPD 27.07.xx) for more
          information on VAXset.

          VAX DEC/Test Manager allows the user to create a library area
          for test result storage. It allows users to:

          o  Access DEC/Test Manager functions via command line interface,
             VMS DECwindows interface or software callable interface.

          o  Create descriptions of their software tests and store related
             files in VMS directories or CMS libraries. Such directo-
             ries or CMS libraries may be local to the VMS cluster or
             distributed on remote VMS nodes accessible via DFS.

          o  Group these test descriptions into meaningful combinations
             for later runs.

          o  Display and modify the test descriptions or groups of test
             descriptions.

          o  Specify command files as test templates to exercise software
             in noninteractive tests.

          o  Record and replay interactive terminal and interactive
             DECwindows sessions.

          o  Edit interactive terminal sessions and interactive DECwindows
             sessions to alter the tests exercise of an application.

          o  Execute specific tests, groups of tests or combinations of
             groups of tests.

          o  Save application output from test recording or execution
             as benchmarks against which result output from later test
             execution will be compared.

          o  Filter test results from non-interactive and interactive
             terminal tests to replace run-dependent information such as
             dates, times and file specifications.

          o  Compare the results of the executed tests with benchmark test
             results, providing formatted differences output for review.

          o  Mask screen output results for DECwindows tests to ignore
             areas of screens when results of executed tests are compared
             against benchmark tests results.

          o  View test results and differences interactively, providing
             screen by screen differences review for interactive tests and
             review of differences reports for noninteractive tests.

          o  Update benchmarks as needed.

          VAX DEC/Test Manager runs on VMS and is targeted for use by
          software engineers working on a wide range of software projects
          that can be tested interactively or in batch.

          Features

          o  CREATE - Allows for the creation of a new Test Manager Li-
             brary, creation of test descriptions and groups, definition
             of pointers to related files, and inclusion of information to
             be used during the selection or execution of tests.

          o  COPY - Allows the copying of a test description to be stored
             under another name where it can be modified without affecting
             the original test description.

          o  MODIFY - Changes the value of fields in an existing test
             description or variable definition as supplied by the user.
             (Variables are VMS logicals or symbols.)

          o  INSERT - Puts a test description into a group thus allow-
             ing association of related tests. It may also be used to
             associate groups with other groups of tests.

          o  SUBMIT - Runs selected tests in a specified batch queue.

          o  COMPARE - Compares the results of test executions with cor-
             responding benchmark files. VAX DEC/Test Manager allows the
             user to establish benchmark files for test results determined
             to be correct. It also allows the user see any differences
             between a test's benchmark file and the results of subsequent
             test runs.

          o  REVIEW - Provides a structured interactive means for examin-
             ing test run results. It operates as a subsystem with a full
             set of commands to iterate over a collection of test results.

          o  VERIFY - Performs consistency checks on the library and re-
             covers from a malfunction by nullifying a partially completed
             transaction.

          o  SHOW - Displays the values of various objects of the cur-
             rent VAX DEC/Test Manager session. Users can display the
             directory spec of the Test Manager Library, field values of
             test descriptions, variables, groups and tests collected for
             execution.

          o  STOP - Stops and deletes a collection that has been submitted
             to a batch queue.
