           PRODUCT NAME:  VAXcluster Software, Version 5.5       SPD
           29.78.05

           DESCRIPTION

           VAXcluster Software is a VMS System Integrated Product (SIP).
           It provides a highly integrated VMS computing environment
           distributed over multiple VAX, VAX Workstation, and MicroVAX CPUs.
           This environment is called a VAXcluster system.

           CPUs in a VAXcluster system can share processing, mass stor-
           age, and other resources under a single VMS security and man-
           agement domain. Within this highly integrated environment,
           CPUs retain their independence because they use local, memory-
           resident copies of the VMS Operating System. Thus, VAXclus-
           ter CPUs can boot and shut down independently while bene-
           fiting from common resources.

           Applications running on one or more CPUs in a VAXcluster sys-
           tem access shared resources in a coordinated manner. VAX-
           cluster Software components synchronize access to shared re-
           sources, preventing multiple processes on any CPU in the VAX-
           cluster from interfering with each other when updating data.
           This coordination ensures data integrity during multiple con-
           current update transactions.

           Because resources are shared, VAXcluster systems offer higher
           availability than standalone CPUs. Properly configured VAX-
           cluster systems can withstand the shut down or failure of
           various components. For example, if one CPU in a VAXclus-
           ter is shut down, users can log on to another CPU to cre-
           ate a new process and continue working; since mass storage

           is shared VAXcluster-wide, the new process is able to ac-
           cess the original data. Applications can be designed to sur-
           vive these events automatically.

           All VAXcluster systems have the following software features
           in common:

           o  Shared file system - The VMS Operating System and VAX-
              cluster software allows all CPUs to share read and write
              access to disk files in a fully coordinated environment.
              Application programs can specify the level of VAXcluster-
              wide file sharing that is required; access is then co-
              ordinated by the VMS Extended QIO Processor (XQP) and Record
              Management Services (RMS).

           o  Shared batch and print queues are accessible from any CPU
              in the VAXcluster system. The VMS queue manager controls
              VAXcluster-wide batch and print queues, which can be ac-
              cessed by any CPU. Batch jobs submitted to VAXcluster-
              wide queues are routed to any available CPU so the batch
              load is shared.

           o  The VMS Lock Manager System Services operate in a VAXcluster-
              wide manner. These services enable reliable coordinated
              access to any resource and provide signaling mechanisms,
              at the system and process level, across the whole VAX-
              cluster system.

           o  All disks and TMSCP tapes in a VAXcluster system can be
              made accessible to all CPUs.

           o  Process information and control services are available
              VAXcluster-wide to application programs and system util-
              ities.

           o  An automated configuration command procedure assists in
              adding and removing CPUs and in modifying their config-
              uration characteristics.

           o  The dynamic Show Cluster Utility displays the status of
              VAXcluster hardware components and communication links.

           o  Standard VMS system and security features work in a VAXcluster-
              wide manner such that the entire VAXcluster system op-
              erates as a single security domain.

           o  The VAXcluster software dynamically balances the inter-
              connect I/O load in VAXcluster configurations that in-
              clude multiple interconnects.

           o  Multiple VAXcluster systems can be configured on a sin-
              gle Local Area Network (LAN).

           Definitions:

           The following terms are used throughout this SPD:

           o  CPU (Central Processing Unit) - A VAX-family computer that
              includes one or more processors. A CPU operates as a VAX-
              cluster node. A VAXcluster node can be referred to as VAX-
              cluster member.

           o  Disk server - A CPU that makes disks to which it has di-
              rect access available to other CPUs in the VAXcluster sys-
              tem, using the VMS MSCP Server.

           o  Maintenance Operations Protocol (MOP) server - A CPU that
              services satellite boot requests, using DECnet-VAX soft-
              ware, to provide the initial Local Area Network (LAN) down-
              line load sequence of the VMS Operating System and VAX-
              cluster software. At the end of the initial down-line load
              sequence, the satellite uses a disk server to perform the
              remainder of the VMS booting process.

           o  Satellite - A CPU that is booted over a LAN using a MOP
              server and disk server.

           o  Tape server - A CPU that makes TMSCP tapes to which it
              has direct access available to other CPUs in the VAXclus-
              ter system, using the VMS TMSCP Server.

           o  Mixed Interconnect VAXcluster System - A VAXcluster sys-
              tem that uses more than one type of interconnect for VAX-
              cluster communication.

           Interconnects:

           VAXcluster systems are configured by connecting multiple CPUs
           with a communication media, referred to as an interconnect.
           VAXcluster nodes communicate with each other using the most
           appropriate interconnect available. Whenever possible, in
           the event of interconnect failure, VAXcluster software will
           automatically use an alternate interconnect. VAXcluster Soft-
           ware supports any combination of the following interconnects:

           o  Computer Interconnect (CI)

           o  Ethernet (NI)

           o  Digital Storage System Interconnect (DSSI)[*]

           o  Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI)

           Ethernet and FDDI are industry-standard general purpose com-
           munications interconnects that can be used to implement a
           Local Area Network (LAN). Except where noted, VAXcluster sup-
           port for both of these LAN types is identical.

           Configuration Rules:

           The following configuration rules apply to VAXcluster sys-
           tems:

           o  The maximum number of CPUs supported in a VAXcluster sys-
              tem is 96.

           o  Every VAXcluster node must have a direct communication
              path to every other VAXcluster node via any of the sup-
              ported interconnects.

           _________________
         [*] The DSSI is not used as a VAXcluster interconnect when ac-
             cessed via a KFQSA Q-bus adapter.  The KFQSA adapter only

             supports access to DSSI mass storage devices.

           o  VAX 11/7xx, 6000, 8xxx, and 9000-series CPUs require a
              system disk that is accessed via a local controller or
              through a local CI or DSSI connection. VAXcluster satel-
              lite booting is not supported for these systems.

           o  A Star Coupler is a common connection point for CI con-
              nected CPUs and HSC subsystems. All CPUs connected to a
              Star Coupler must be configured as VAXcluster members.
              A VAXcluster system can include any number of Star Cou-
              plers. The number of CI adapters supported by different
              CPUs can be found in Table 2 in this SPD; the number of
              Star Couplers that a CPU can be connected to is limited
              by the number of adapters it is configured with.

           o  The maximum number of CPUs that can be connected to a Star
              Coupler is 16, regardless of Star Coupler size.

           o  The RA-series disks and TA-series tapes can be dual pathed
              between pairs of HSC subsystems on the same Star Coupler,
              or between two local controllers. Such dual pathing pro-
              vides enhanced data availability using a VMS automatic
              recovery capability called failover. Failover is the abil-
              ity to use an alternate hardware path from a CPU to a stor-
              age device when a failure occurs on the current path. The
              failover process is transparent to applications. Dual pathing
              between an HSC and a local controller is not permitted.
              When two local controllers are used for dual pathing, each
              controller must be located on a separate CPU.

           o  When multiple CPUs are connected to a common DSSI they
              must all be configured as VAXcluster members. Since the
              KFQSA Q-bus-to-DSSI adapter does not support VAXcluster
              communication to other CPUs on the DSSI, CPUs using this
              adapter must include another interconnect for VAXclus-
              ter communication.

           VAXcluster Software, Version 5.5            SPD 29.78.05


           o  VAX 6000-series CPUs can be connected to a DSSI bus us-
              ing the KFMSA XMI-DSSI adapter. Any mix of VAX 6000-series
              and VAX 4000-series systems (excluding the VAX 4000 Model
              200) can be configured on a common DSSI bus, up to a max-
              imum of three CPUs.

           o  A maximum of three VAX 4000 series, Q-bus-based MicroVAX
              3000 series, and MicroVAX II systems can be configured
              on a common DSSI bus. In triple CPU configurations, the
              middle CPU must be a VAX 4000 Model 300, or higher, sys-
              tem.

           o  VAXcluster systems support 4 LAN adapters per CPU for VAX-
              cluster communications. LAN segments can be bridged to
              form an extended LAN.

           o  CPUs that use an Ethernet for VAXcluster communications
              can concurrently use it for other network protocols that
              conform to the applicable Ethernet standards, such as Eth-
              ernet V2.0, IEEE 802.2, and IEEE 802.3.

           o  CPUs that use an FDDI for VAXcluster communications can
              concurrently use it for other network protocols that con-
              form to the applicable FDDI standards, such as ANSI X3.139-
              1987, ANSI X3.148-1988, and ANSI X3.166-1990

           o  All LAN bridges must provide a low-latency data path, with
              approximately 10 megabits per second throughput for Eth-
              ernet and 100 megabits per second throughput for FDDI.
              Translating bridges must be used when connecting VAXclus-
              ter nodes on an Ethernet to those on an FDDI.

           o  The maximum number of VAXcluster members that can be di-
              rectly connected to the FDDI, via the DEC FDDIcontroller
              400 (DEMFA), is 16.

           o  A DECnet-VAX communication path must exist between all
              nodes in a VAXcluster system.

           o  A single time zone setting must be used by all CPUs in
              a VAXcluster system.

           VAXcluster Software, Version 5.5            SPD 29.78.05


           o  A VAXcluster system can be configured with a maximum of
              one Quorum Disk. A Quorum Disk cannot be a member of a
              shadow, volume, or stripe set.

           Recommendations:

           The optimal VAXcluster system configuration for any comput-
           ing environment is based on requirements of cost, function-
           ality, performance, capacity, and availability. Factors that
           impact these requirements include:

           o  Applications in use

           o  Number of users

           o  Number and model of CPUs

           o  Interconnects and adapter types

           o  Disk and tape I/O capacity and access time

           o  Number of disks and tapes being served

           o  Interconnect utilization

           Digital recommends VAXcluster system configurations based
           on its experience with the VAXcluster Software Product. The
           customer should evaluate specific application dependencies
           and performance requirements to determine an appropriate con-
           figuration for the desired computing environment.

           When planning a VAXcluster system, consider the following
           recommendations:

           o  While VAXcluster systems can include any number of sys-
              tem disks, performance and disk space should be consid-
              ered in determining their number and location. It is im-
              portant to recognize that system management efforts in-
              crease in proportion to the number of system disks.

           VAXcluster Software, Version 5.5            SPD 29.78.05


           o  VAXcluster CPUs should be configured using interconnects
              that provide appropriate performance for the required sys-
              tem usage. In general, use the highest performance in-
              terconnect possible. CI, DSSI, and FDDI are the preferred
              interconnects between powerful VAX CPUs.

           o  Data availability and I/O performance is enhanced when
              multiple VAXcluster nodes have direct access to shared
              storage; whenever possible, configure systems to allow
              direct access to shared storage in favor of VMS MSCP Served
              access. Multi-access DSSI- and HSC-based storage provide
              higher data availability and I/O performance than singly
              accessed, local controller-based storage. Additionally,
              dual pathing of DSA disks between local or HSC storage
              controllers enhances data availability in the event of
              controller failure.

           o  VAXcluster systems can provide enhanced availability by
              utilizing redundant components. For example, additional
              CPUs, storage controllers, and disks and tapes can be con-
              figured. Extra peripheral options such as printers and
              terminals can be included to further enhance availabil-
              ity. Multiple instances of all the VAXcluster intercon-
              nects (CI, DSSI, Ethernet, and FDDI) are supported.

           o  If possible, LAN-based and Mixed Interconnect VAXclus-
              ter systems should include multiple MOP and disk servers
              to enhance availability. When a server fails in config-
              urations that include multiple servers, satellite access
              to disks fails over to another server. Disk servers should
              be the most powerful CPUs in the VAXcluster and should
              use the highest bandwidth LAN adapters available.

           o  When a LAN-based VAXcluster system is configured with high
              performance nodes, multiple LAN adapters and intercon-
              nects can be used to increase total communication band-
              width.

           VAXcluster Software, Version 5.5            SPD 29.78.05


           o  Maintenance of complex LAN-based VAXcluster configura-
              tions can be simplified with the aid of the VMS LAVC$FAILURE_
              ANALYSIS program, which is available in the SYS$EXAMPLES
              directory.

           o  VAXclusters are sensitive to the LAN traffic levels. The
              average LAN segment utilization should not exceed 60 per-
              cent for any 10 second interval. Nodes can leave the clus-
              ter if they cannot properly exchange the HELLO messages
              every three seconds. LAN bridges can be used to local-
              ize VAXcluster system traffic should the overall level
              of network traffic be a concern. Also, it is possible for
              VAXcluster nodes to exist on both sides of a LAN bridge.

           o  The performance of an FDDI LAN will vary with each con-
              figuration. When an FDDI is used for VAXcluster commu-
              nications, the ring latency when the FDDI ring is idle
              should not exceed 400 microseconds.

           o  When under heavy network load, bridges are subject to packet
              loss and retransmission, due to congestion. This is es-
              pecially true of Ethernet to FDDI bridges. In a VAXclus-
              ter environment, heavy network loads can result when many
              satellite nodes are booted simultaneously. It may be nec-
              essary to minimize simultaneous booting, or limit the num-
              ber of nodes that utilize these LAN bridges.

           o  The VAXcluster Multi-Datacenter Facility is specifically
              designed to allow successful implementation and manage-
              ment of disaster-tolerant configurations and to deliver
              predictable recovery from site failures.

              For more information, refer to the VAXcluster Multi-Datacenter
              Facility Software Product Description (SPD 35.05.xx).

           o  The optional VMS Volume Shadowing System Integrated Prod-
              uct provides the following advantages:

              -  Enhanced data availability in the event of disk fail-
                 ure

                 disks

              Software Product Description (SPD 27.29.xx.).

           HARDWARE SUPPORT

           Supported CPUs:

           VAXcluster Software, Version 5.5            SPD 29.78.05


           Supported Peripheral Options:

           VAXcluster systems can use all peripheral options supported
           by the VMS SPD. Refer to the VMS Software Product Descrip-
           tion (SPD 25.01.xx) for further information.

           Memory Requirements:

           All VAXcluster CPUs must have a minimum of 4 megabytes of
           physical memory.

           Star Coupler Expander:

           A Computer Interconnect Star Coupler Expander (CISCE) can
           be added to any Star Coupler to increase its connection ca-
           pacity to 32 ports. The maximum number of CPUs that can be
           connected to a Star Coupler is 16, regardless of size.

           HSC Subsystems:

           VAXcluster software supports all models of the HSC family
           of intelligent mass storage controllers. These controllers
           include many features:

           o  The ability to provide high data throughput and I/O rates

           o  Implementation of many mass storage performance optimiza-
              tion techniques

           o  Multi-CPU access to disk and tape units

           o  The ability to configure multiple disk and tape units

           o  Optional HSC-based disk caching (for the HSC60 and HSC90)

           o  HSC resident maintenance and backup facilities

           The following rules apply for HSC subsystems:

           o  HSC Software, Version 6.0, at a minimum, is required for
              the HSC40, HSC60, HSC70, and HSC90. HSC Software, Ver-
              sion 4.1, at a minimum, is required for the HSC50.

           o  Each HSC40 supports a maximum of 12 ports.

                                      12

 



           VAXcluster Software, Version 5.5            SPD 29.78.05


           o  Each HSC50 supports a maximum of 24 ports.

           o  Each HSC60 supports a maximum of 20 ports.

           o  Each HSC70 supports a maximum of 32 ports.

           o  Each HSC90 supports a maximum of 48 ports.

           o  All ports can be used for disk storage. The maximum num-
              ber of ports that can be used for tapes is 24 for the HSC70
              and HSC90, and 12 for the HSC40, HSC50, and HSC60.

           SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

           o  VMS Operating System

              VAXcluster Software, Version 5.5 is a VMS System Inte-
              grated Product that requires VMS, Version 5.5.

              Refer to the VMS Software Product Description (SPD 25.01.xx)
              for further information.

              VMS, Version 5.4, and all its sub-versions (for example
              V5.4-1, and V5.4-2), can coexist in a VAXcluster with VMS,
              Version 5.5 (and all its sub-versions). Only one version
              of VMS can exist on each system disk. In configurations
              with multiple system disks, a rolling upgrade can be per-
              formed so that continuous VAXcluster system operation is
              maintained during the upgrade process. During a rolling
              upgrade, a separate system disk is required for each ver-
              sion. Rolling upgrades occur in a series of phases dur-
              ing which all VAXcluster nodes are brought up to the lat-
              est VMS version.

              During a rolling upgrade from Version 5.4 to Version 5.5,
              V5.4 Batch and Print functionality is maintained. Once
              the VAXcluster system is fully upgraded to Version 5.5,
              the new V5.5 Batch and Print functionality becomes avail-
              able. Once the new V5.5 Batch and Print facility is op-
              erational, booting V5.4 CPUs into the VAXcluster system
              is only permitted if they do not use any Batch and Print

              operations (i.e., START/QUEUE/MANAGER). Coexistence of
              the V5.4 and V5.5 Batch and Print facilities is not sup-
              ported.

              Digital recommends that all VAX systems in a VAXcluster
              run the latest version of VMS.

           o  DECnet-VAX Software

              All VAXcluster CPUs require either an End Node or Full
              Function DECnet-VAX license.

              Refer to the DECnet-VAX Software Product Description (SPD
              25.03.xx) for further information.

           OPTIONAL SOFTWARE

           For information on VAXcluster support for optional software
           products, refer to the VAXcluster Support section of the Soft-
           ware Product Description (SPD) documents for those products.

           Optional products that are particularly useful in VAXclus-
           ter systems include:

           o  VMS Volume Shadowing (SPD 27.29.xx)

           o  VAX Performance Advisor (SPD 27.71.xx)
