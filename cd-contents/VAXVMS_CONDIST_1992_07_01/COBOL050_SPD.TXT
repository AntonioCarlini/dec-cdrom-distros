 PRODUCT NAME:  VAX COBOL, Version 5.0                  SPD 25.04.24

 DESCRIPTION

 VAX COBOL is a high-level language for business data processing that
 operates under the VMS Operating System, taking full advantage of the
 system facilities and the VAX Information Architecture. It is based
 upon the 1985 ANSI COBOL Standard X3.23-1985 as modified by the X.23a-
 1989 amendment.

 VAX COBOL is integrated with the VAX Information Architecture and in-
 cludes various Digital extensions to COBOL, including screen handling
 at the source language level.

 VAX COBOL has been validated by the National Bureau of Standards for
 conformance to "FIPS PUB 21-3, Federal Standard COBOL", at the high
 level.

 Two features provide access to the VAX Information Architecture from
 VAX COBOL. The Data Manipulation Language (DML) allows users to ac-
 cess DBMS databases with VAX DBMS. VAX DBMS must be installed to use
 this feature. The COPY FROM DICTIONARY statement, a Digital COBOL ex-
 tension, allows access to common record definitions stored in CDD/Repository
 (formerly VAX CDD/Plus). CDD/Repository must be installed to use this
 feature.

 The following partial list of Digital extensions to COBOL are imple-
 mented in VAX COBOL:

 o  Screen handling is implemented using the DISPLAY and ACCEPT state-
    ments. The DISPLAY statement enables the programmer to display in-
    formation or prompts anywhere on a video screen. The ACCEPT state-
    ment takes information typed anywhere on the screen and returns the

                               DIGITAL                     JUNE 1992

                                                         AE-J847Z-TE

 

    value to a running VAX COBOL program. The DISPLAY statement con-
    verts data from internal numeric format to "ASCII display format";
    and the ACCEPT WITH CONVERSION statement converts "ASCII display"
    input characters to internal numeric formats as appropriate. The
    terminal-type is recognized at runtime from information provided
    by the operating system.

 o  RMS-STS and RMS-STV special registers may be examined to assist de-
    bugging. These registers contain status values from the Record Man-
    agement System (VAX RMS).

 o  File sharing and record locking features enable more than one user
    to access data at the same time.

 o  Many file capabilities are available through VAX RMS including ex-
    tensions for descending keys and duplicate primary keys.

 o  Conditional compilation serves to make debugging easier.

 o  The /INSTRUCTION_SET qualifier customizes object code generation
    to target the different classes of VAX processors, maximizing spe-
    cific processor features.

 o  Access to VAX DBMS databases through CODASYL's definition of Data
    COBOL Manipulation Language (DML) statements.

 o  Access to CDD/Repository record and field definitions.

 o  Source program terminal format recognition.

 VAX COBOL implements several statements designed to make programming
 easier in the VMS environment:

 o  CALL statement extensions: BY VALUE, BY DESCRIPTOR, OMITTED and GIV-
    ING

 o  VALUE IS EXTERNAL - Access to link time constants

 o  USAGE IS POINTER - Address data type

 o  VALUE IS REFERENCE - Compile time address evaluation

 o  SET TO REFERENCE - Runtime address evaluation

                                  2

 

 o  SUCCESS/FAILURE - Class conditions

 Other extensions include:

 o  Thirty-one character user-names

 o  ACCEPT AT END statement

 o  Single-quote-delimited, non-numeric literals

 o  Hyphen/underscore equivalence in user-names

 o  Non-numeric literal argument passing

 The VAX COBOL compiler produces an object module from a source pro-
 gram. The compiler is capable of producing a source listing with em-
 bedded diagnostics indicating the line and position of a source-code
 error, a machine language listing, a file-name map, a data-name map,
 a procedure-name map, an external program name map, subschema infor-
 mation and a cross-reference listing. The cross-reference listing and
 maps may be produced in either alphabetical order or in order of dec-
 laration. The cross-reference listing distinguishes destructive ref-
 erences to data from read-only references.

 VAX COBOL provides support for error diagnostics and cross-reference
 information to VAX Language-Sensitive Editor/Source Code Analyzer. Ad-
 ditionally, VAX COBOL provides support for the processing of pseudocode
 and design comments which are used by VAX Language-Sensitive Editor
 /Source Code Analyzer for low-level program design.

 Object modules produced by the compiler can be linked with other ob-
 ject modules produced by many other languages, including VAX BASIC and
 VAX FORTRAN. VAX COBOL is supported by both the VAX Common Run Time
 Library (VAX RTL) and the VAX Symbolic Debugger.

 The VAX COBOL product includes a COBOL compiler and the REFORMAT util-
 ity. The REFORMAT utility converts source programs from Digital ter-
 minal format to ANSI-standard COBOL format and vice versa.
