          PRODUCT NAME:  VIDA for DB2[TM], Version 1.0        SPD 25.E7.02
                         (DEC RdbAccess for DB2)

          1  DESCRIPTION

          DEC RdbAccess is a family of database interoperability products
          that provide direct, transparent access from VAX Rdb/VMS appli-
          cations to non-VAX Rdb/VMS databases and files. DEC RdbAccess
          servers are specialized VAX Rdb/VMS runtime systems that can
          be accessed by most applications and tools that work with VAX
          Rdb/VMS.

          VIDA for DB2, a member of the DEC RdbAccess product family,
          is a database interoperability product that permits access to
          IBM[R] DATABASE 2[TM] (DB2) databases resident on IBM main-
          frame systems. VIDA for DB2 (also known as DEC RdbAccess for
          DB2) provides direct, transparent, read-only access to DB2
          databases residing on IBM MVS/XA[TM] or MVS/ESA[TM] systems
          from applications developed using products such as VAX RALLY,
          VAX DATATRIEVE, VAX TEAMDATA, and DECdecision. VIDA for DB2
          also supports access from the VAX Rdb/VMS utilities, includ-
          ing interactive SQL and RDO, from pre-compiled 3GL applications
          with embedded SQL or RDML, and from desktop applications using
          SQL/Services. VAX Data Distributor can be used to extract data
          from DB2 and replicate the information across the network in VAX
          Rdb/VMS.

          VIDA for DB2 is engineered using a client/server architecture.
          It consists of two component products and uses Digital's DEC-
          net/SNA interconnect products. VIDA Client for DB2 (hereafter
          referred to as VIDA Client) is a VAX-resident product that ac-
          cepts requests for DB2 data from VAX applications. VIDA Client
          converts the requests into DB2 SQL and passes the requests to
          the IBM-based component, VIDA Server for DB2 (hereafter referred

                                       DIGITAL               February 1991

                                                               AE-MH79C-TE

          to as VIDA Server). VIDA Client and VIDA Server communicate us-
          ing a DECnet/SNA Gateway or VMS/SNA (hereafter referred to as
          a gateway) and the DECnet/SNA VMS APPC/LU6.2 Programming In-
          terface (hereafter referred to as APPC/LU6.2 PI). VIDA Server
          submits each request to DB2 using the dynamic SQL interface.
          Data obtained from DB2 is passed back to VIDA Client through the
          gateway, and VIDA Client returns the data to the requesting ap-
          plication. The application can use the accessed data as it would
          any locally accessed data. For example, the data can be stored
          in a VAX database or VAX RMS file, or it could be displayed on a
          screen or printed.

          VIDA Client runs under VMS on VAX, MicroVAX, VAXstation, and
          VAXserver systems. VIDA Server runs as a CICS transaction on IBM
          System/370 mainframe systems running the IBM MVS/XA or MVS/ESA
          Operating Systems.

          2  Features

          o  VIDA for DB2 provides direct database access to IBM-based DB2
             tables and views. The user application accesses DB2 data the
             same way it would access Rdb/VMS data.

          o  VIDA for DB2 does not require users to create a copy of the
             IBM database on a VAX system. Creating VAX-resident extracts
             of IBM data is a matter of user preference and convenience.

          o  Applications can be developed to retrieve data directly from
             the DB2 database. Data retrieved from the mainframe database
             can be displayed at a user's terminal, printed, or copied to
             VAX Rdb/VMS and VAX DBMS databases or to VAX RMS files.

          o  VIDA for DB2 is layered within the VAX Rdb/VMS runtime sys-
             tem. All requests for DB2 data are processed by the VAX
             Rdb/VMS runtime system. A user or programmer makes requests
             to DB2 using exactly the same commands as would be used to
             access VAX Rdb/VMS.

          o  VIDA for DB2 supports many of the same user interfaces that
             can be used with VAX Rdb/VMS.

          o  DB2 data can be accessed interactively using VAX Rdb/VMS
             interactive SQL or RDO.

          o  DB2 data can be extracted and stored in Rdb/VMS tables using
             VAX Data Distributor.

          o  DB2 data can be accessed directly from third generation lan-
             guage (3GL) programs using embedded SQL, SQL module language,
             dynamic SQL, callable RDO, or Data Manipulation Language
             (DML). These data access sublanguages are the same sublan-
             guages used to access VAX Rdb/VMS data tables and views. The
             VAX Rdb/VMS development option is required to develop 3GL
             applications that use VIDA for DB2. VAX Rdb/VMS provides SQL
             pre-compiler support for languages such as Ada, C, COBOL,
             FORTRAN, and PL/I. VAX Rdb/VMS provides DML pre-compiler
             support for languages such as BASIC, C, COBOL, FORTRAN, and
             Pascal. SQL module language or callable RDO can be used with
             any language that supports the VMS calling standard. Refer to
             the VAX Rdb/VMS (SPD 25.59.xx) for a complete description of
             programming language support.

          o  When VIDA for DB2 is used with VAX DATATRIEVE, users can
             generate DATATRIEVE queries and reports that include data
             from DB2 tables or views.

          o  When VIDA for DB2 is used with VAX TEAMDATA, end users can
             access DB2 data tables and views directly, join them with
             TEAMDATA tables, store the results in TEAMDATA folders,
             etc. for use in decision support and other personal and
             departmental applications.

          o  When VIDA for DB2 is used with VAX RALLY, online applications
             can retrieve information directly from DB2 at application
             execution time.

          o  When a request is made for DB2 data, the VAX Rdb/VMS runtime
             system passes the request to VIDA Client. VIDA Client con-
             verts the request into DB2 SQL and sends the request to VIDA
             Server on the target IBM system. The request is sent through
             a gateway using the APPC/LU6.2 PI.

          o  VIDA Server accepts the SQL request from VIDA Client and sub-
             mits it to DB2 using the dynamic SQL interface. The results
             of the request are passed back through the gateway to VIDA
             Client.

          o  VIDA Client performs automatic EBCDIC/ASCII translation
             and passes the results to the calling program. EBCDIC/ASCII
             translation is performed using a default translation table.
             An alternate user-defined translation table can be used if
             the default is not appropriate.

          o  VIDA Server runs as a CICS transaction. Sites can apply CICS
             tuning techniques to the VIDA Server CICS transaction just as
             they can to other CICS transactions.

          o  VIDA Server works in conjunction with existing security
             products in IBM environments, for example ACF2[TM], RACF,
             and default CICS security. VIDA users require an IBM account
             and must be properly authorized within CICS and DB2 to access
             DB2 data.

          o  VIDA Server uses a view to retrieve metadata from the DB2
             catalog. The view can be redirected at installation time to
             access user-defined data tables that contain catalog data.
             When a VMS user attaches to the DB2 database, the metadata
             is automatically passed to VIDA Client, which converts the
             definitions into Digital relational data definitions.

          o  The Digital relational data definitions created by VIDA
             Client can be stored in CDD/Plus using RDO or SQL INTE-
             GRATE commands. 3GL programs can be compiled against data
             definitions in CDD/Plus.

          o  VIDA for DB2 uses Digital DECnet/SNA interconnect software
             and hardware, including the DECnet/SNA Gateways, VMS/SNA, and
             the DECnet/SNA VMS APPC/LU6.2 Programming Interface to make
             the VAX to IBM communications link.

          o  VIDA for DB2 uses LU6.2 communications protocols to achieve
             fast and efficient data transfer.

          o  VIDA Client on one VMS system can provide DB2 data access
             to local or remote users in the same DECnet network provided
             that users on the remote systems have access to VAX Rdb/VMS
             remote data access capabilities.

          o  VIDA for DB2 provides a logging facility that can trace com-
             munications activity, log errors, and help isolate problems.

          Limitations

          VIDA for DB2 provides read-only access.
