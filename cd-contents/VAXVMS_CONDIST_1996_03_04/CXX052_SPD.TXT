       PRODUCT NAME:  DEC C++ Version 5.2 for OpenVMS VAX     SPD 37.39.05
		      DEC C++ Version 5.2 for OpenVMS Alpha

       DESCRIPTION

       DEC C++ for OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha Operating Systems is a na-
       tive programming language product that supports the C++ programming
       language. It includes:

       o  A C++ compiler that implements C++ as defined by The Annotated C++
	  Reference Manual, Ellis & Stroustrup, as reprinted with corrections
	  in May 1991. The compiler implementation includes templates but ex-
	  cludes exception handling. DEC C++ directly generates optimized ob-
	  ject code. No intermediate translation to C is employed.

       o  A DEC C++ Class Library that consists of the following class li-
	  brary packages: iostream, complex, generic, Objection, Stopwatch,
	  String, task, Messages, and vector.

       o  ANSI/ISO C header files enhanced for use with the DEC C++ compiler.
	  These headers are currently packaged with DEC C++ to make them avail-
	  able for use with DEC C++. Packaging of the headers is subject to
	  change as they become available in subsequent releases of related
	  products.

       The available documentation provides comprehensive reference and us-
       age information for all product components. Included only as part of
       the hardcopy documentation is a copy of an authoritative book on C++,
       The C++ Programming Language, 2nd edition, by Bjarne Stroustrup.

       DEC C++ Version 5.2 for OpenVMS VAX                   SPD 37.39.05
       DEC C++ Version 5.2 for OpenVMS Alpha

       The documentation is provided in both online and hardcopy formats. The
       online documentation consists of Help files included on the media kit,
       and Bookreader documents included on the OpenVMS Online Documentation
       CD-ROM.

       Features

       o  Fast compilation and increased code optimization by directly trans-
	  lating C++ source programs to OpenVMS VAX and Alpha object files

       o  Extensive global and local optimizations of generated code for in-
	  creased performance under OpenVMS

       o  Option for running only the preprocessor phase of compilation

       o  Pragmas to control compiler options

	  -  Pragmas to control extern models, sharing of data between con-
	     current processes, and structure member alignment

       o  Separate and combined compilation capabilities

       o  Compiler generated listing file including optional:

	  -  Machine code

	  -  Macro expansion

	  -  Compilation statistics

       o  Data types for numeric, nonnumeric, and systems programming:

	  -  DEC C++ OpenVMS supports 8, 16, 32-bit signed and unsigned in-
	     tegers. DEC C++ OpenVMS Alpha supports 64-bit signed and unsigned
	     integers.

	  -  DEC C++ supports the following data types: 32 and 64-bit IEEE
	     floating point on Alpha

	  -  DEC C++ on VAX and Alpha: 32-bit and 64-bit VAX floating-point
	     data types. The VAX floating-point formats include D-float and
	     G-float and are user selectable.

       DEC C++ Version 5.2 for OpenVMS Alpha

       o  Integration into the Program Development Environment:

	  -  Generation of complete debug and traceback records for OpenVMS
	     VAX and Alpha symbolic debugger support

	  -  Conforms to the OpenVMS VAX and Alpha calling standard

	  -  Access to the OpenVMS Run-time Library for general purpose rou-
	     tines and support of multi-language environments

	  -  Access to the data management facilities of OpenVMS RMS (Record
	     Management Services)

	  -  Ability to package C++ code as shareable libraries

	  -  Ability to use additional class libraries. The DEC C++ compiler
	     supports logical name search lists in conjunction with the pre-
	     processor directive #include.

	  -  Support for DEC Language-Sensitive Editor to provide error di-
	     agnostics to the Editor

       Run-Time Library for C applications

       With the exception of OpenVMS VAX Operating System prior to Version
       6.1, the complete DEC C Run-Time Library that is needed for use with
       DEC C++ is distributed with both OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha Oper-
       ating Systems. The DEC C Run-Time Library provides shareable routines
       to perform input/output, character and string handling, mathematical
       computations, memory allocation, and emulation of selected UNIX[R] fea-
       tures.

       DEC C++ Class Library

       With the exception of OpenVMS VAX Operating System prior to Version
       6.1, the DEC C++ Class-Library Run-Time components are distributed with
       OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha Operating Systems. The DEC C++ Class Li-
       brary provides the following packages: iostream, complex, generic, ob-
       jection, stopwatch, string, task, message and vector.

       For OpenVMS VAX Operating V5.5-2 - Version 6.0, the DEC C++ VAX kit
       includes a separately packaged saveset that contains all the run-time
       library components needed to execute programs developed with the DEC
       C++ compiler and class libraries. (These components are included with
       the OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha Operating Systems Versions 6.1 and
       6.2).

       These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
       sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
       system environment, configuration, and software options. The Debug kit
       saveset installation is not used on OpenVMS V6.0 systems, and the Run-
       Time Kit saveset installation uses greatly reduced space on OpenVMS
       V6.0 systems.

       Note: A version update represents a complete distribution media replace-
       ment for the previous release of DEC C++. Product changes and func-
       tional enhancements in a version update may require the recompilation
       and relinking of all modules in an application built with a prior ver-
       sion of DEC C++ to provide for proper operation with the new release
