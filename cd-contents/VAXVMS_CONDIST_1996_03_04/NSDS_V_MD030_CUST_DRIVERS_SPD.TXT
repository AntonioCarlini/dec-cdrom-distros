   PRODUCT NAME:  DEC DB Integrator Gateway               SPD 45.40.05
                  for Custom Drivers, Version 3.0D, for Open-
                  VMS

   DESCRIPTION

   DEC DB Integrator Gateway for Custom Drivers for OpenVMS (Custom Drivers
   Gateway) enables the implementation of gateways that provide relational
   access to non-relational data sources. These gateways provide appli-
   cations and tools with direct read/write access to these data sources
   through the gateway's interactive SQL or dynamic SQL interfaces. Client
   /server access is supported through the SQL/Services facility and a
   driver for Microsoft[R] Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) clients. Op-
   tional support for embedded SQL and SQL module language programming
   is available.

   When used in conjunction with DEC DB Integrator (DBI) and other DBI
   gateways, the Custom Drivers Gateway enables the integration of cus-
   tom and proprietary data sources with other relational and non-relational
   data sources including: SYBASE[R] Informix[R], ORACLE7[R], IBM[R] DB2[TM],
   Oracle Rdb, Oracle CODASYL DBMS and DSM databases as well as OpenVMS
   RMS files and IBM MVS and VM/CMS data sets.

   The Custom Drivers Gateway runs under the OpenVMS operating system on
   Digital Alpha and VAX systems, servers, and workstations.

   DEC DB Integrator Gateway                             SPD 45.40.05
   for Custom Drivers, Version 3.0D, for OpenVMS

   The Non-SQL Data Server is the component that brings data and their
   definitions (metadata) together and makes them appear relational. The
   Non-SQL (Data Server enables applications to access this non-relational
   data in a relational manner. The Non-SQL Data Server plans, optimizes,
   and executes read and write operations.

   Custom Driver Interfaces

   The Custom Drivers Gateway provides two published interfaces, which
   developers may use to write data, and metadata drivers which can work
   with the Non-SQL Data Server to provide customized SQL access to their
   data source.

   A Driver Development Guide as well as source code for sample data and
   metadata drivers are provided for instructional purposes. Some SQL fea-
   tures require specific capabilities in the source data management sys-
   tem.

   Features

   Relational Access to Non-Relational Data
   The Custom Drivers Gateway allows applications to read and write to
   non-relational data sources using standard SQL syntax and programming
   interfaces.

   Standard DEC SQL Programming Interfaces

   The Custom Drivers Gateway includes DEC SQL interactive and dynamic
   SQL interfaces. The included SQL/Services facility supports the client
   /server implementation style.

   o  The interactive SQL interface provides SQL data manipulation lan-
      guage (DML) support for insert, select, update, delete, join, project
      and order operations.

   for Custom Drivers, Version 3.0D, for OpenVMS

   o  The dynamic SQL interface compiles and executes SQL requests passed
      through its call interface. This programming approach is highly ef-
      fective in applications such as ad-hoc query where the exact pa-
      rameters of requests are not known until runtime. It is compati-
      ble with any programming language that supports the OpenVMS call-
      ing standard. The dynamic memory handling capabilities of Ada, PL/I
      and C enable these languages to take full advantage of the power
      and flexibility of this approach.

   o  The Custom Drivers Gateway performs data format translations for
      supported VMS datatypes as part of processing requests to read or
      update data.

   Desktop Connectivity

   Microsoft Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) applications can read from,
   and write to, Custom Drivers Gateway data sources using the DEC ODBC
   Driver for MS[R] Windows. This driver provides access to SQL/Services
   servers over DECnet or TCP/IP network transports. This driver also pro-
   vides these applications with access to, DB Integrator and the other
   DB Integrator Gateways.

   Distributed Data Access

   The Custom Drivers Gateway supports access from remote clients and to
   remote Custom Driver databases.

   Integration with DEC SQL Applications

   The Custom Drivers Gateway makes data residing in Custom Drivers data sources
   accessible to Digital information management and end-user access tools.

   o  DEC Data Distributor can maintain extracts and rollups of Custom
      Drivers Gateway tables and views.

   o  DATATRIEVE queries, reports, and updates can combine data from Cus-
      tom Drivers Gateways, other DBI gateways and DEC Rdb databases.

   Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1)

   Disk space required for     47,000 blocks
   installation:
                               (23 MB)

   Disk space required for     46,000 blocks
   use (permanent):
                               (23 MB)

   Approximately 39,000 blocks (20 MB) of the permanent requirement is
   for software components common to DEC DB Integrator (DBI) and the DBI
   family of gateways. If one of these products has already been installed
   on a system, the additional disk space required by this product will
   be reduced by approximately that (20 MB) amount.

   These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
   sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
   system environment, configuration, and software options selected.

   Additional space must be allowed for programs, logs, and temporary database
   cache files, and user interface software.

   SERVER SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

   This section lists the software required to install and operate the
   Custom Drivers Gateway.

   Operating System Software


   DB Integrator Gateway for Custom Drivers requires one of the follow-
   ing operating system versions depending upon the hardware platform.

   Server to Server Network Transport Options

   DB Integrator Gateway for Custom Drivers provides read/write access
   to local custom, proprietary, and non-standard data sources. DB In-
   tegrator Gateway for custom drivers does not contain a protocol to ac-
   cess data on a remote node. If that capability is required it would
   have to be built into the Custom Driver Gateway's Data Driver.


   Client to Server Network Transport Options

   The Custom Drivers Gateway for the OpenVMS requires one or more of the
   following network software products installed on the server to sup-
   port direct access to custom, non-standard, and proprietary data sources
   by client applications.

   o  DECnet transport

      -  DECnet for OpenVMS Alpha, V6.1 - V6.2

      -  DECnet for OpenVMS VAX, V5.4 V6.2

   o  TCP/IP transport

      -  DEC TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS (Alpha and VAX) V2.0 - V3.1

   o  Novell NetWare - SQL/Services and DEC ODBC Driver client applica-
      tions communicating via Novell NetWare[R] require a Novell IPX/SPX
      transport - InterConnections Leverage for NetWare File Sharing Ser-
      vices (FSS), V2.0
