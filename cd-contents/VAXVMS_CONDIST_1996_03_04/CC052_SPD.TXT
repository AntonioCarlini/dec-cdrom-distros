          PRODUCT NAME:  DEC C for OpenVMS VAX Version 5.2       SPD 25.38.21
                         DEC C for OpenVMS Alpha Version 5.2

          DESCRIPTION

          DEC C is an ANSI-compliant implementation of the C programming 
          language with Digital extensions. The DEC C compiler runs under the 
          OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha Operating Systems and generates 
          optimized and position-independent code.

          DEC C is a native-mode language product, and is integrated into the
          OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha Common Language Environments. All 
          OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha system services are available to 
          programs written in DEC C. DEC C programs can invoke, as functions, 
          modules written in other VAX and Alpha languages.

          DEC C supports OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha Record Management 
          Services (RMS) for sequential file organizations and associated access
          methods. DEC C also supports stream file-access methods common among
          many C implementations.

          DEC C provides extensive ANSI C conformance checking, and supports the
          lint-like features of the DEC Source Code Analyzer. The DEC Source 
          Code Analyzer allows the programmer to check for consistent function 
          usage throughout a program environment. DEC C also generates complete
          debug and traceback records for use with OpenVMS Debug. Debug allows
          the C programmer to set breakpoints, examine and modify the contents
          of user variables, and selectively halt or continue program execution.

          DEC C on OpenVMS Alpha provides IEEE support as defined by, and is 
          conformant to, the ANSI/IEEE Standard 754.


                                                                November 1995

 



          DEC C for OpenVMS VAX Version 5.2                     SPD 25.38.21
          DEC C for OpenVMS Alpha Version 5.2

          Features

          o  Separate modes of compilation to support each of four C dialects:


             -  A strict ANSI mode that compiles according to the ANSI standard

             -  A relaxed ANSI mode that compiles according to the ANSI 
                standard but accepts additional Digital extensions

             -  A VAX C mode that supports VAX C extensions

             -  A common mode that supports many common usage C constructs as
                implemented on UNIX[R] systems including Digital UNIX (also 
                called "K&R" C or "pcc" mode)

          In addition, the features specified by Addendum 1 to the ISO C 
          standard adopted by ISO in November of 1994 (digraphs and the 
          __STDC_VERSION__ predefined macro) can be added to each of these 
          dialects except for VAX C mode.

          o  Data types for numeric, nonnumeric, and systems programming:

             -  DEC C supports, 8, 16, and 32-bit signed and unsigned integers.
                DEC C OpenVMS Alpha also supports 64-bit signed and unsigned 
                integers.

             -  DEC C supports 32-bit float and 64-bit double floating-point 
                datatypes. The VAX floating-point formats include D-float and 
                G-float and are user selectable.

             -  DEC C OpenVMS Alpha also supports IEEE format and offers user
                selectable 64-bit or 128-bit precision for the long double data
                type.

             -  DEC C supports passing numeric constants by reference in 
                function calls.

             -  DEC C supports the multibyte and wide character types and 
                features of XPG4, with the locale support available in OpenVMS 
                V6.2 and subsequent versions.

          DEC C for OpenVMS VAX Version 5.2                     SPD 25.38.21
          DEC C for OpenVMS Alpha Version 5.2

             -  DEC C OpenVMS Alpha, on OpenVMS Version 7.0 and later, supports
                user-controlled features to specify the use of 64-bit pointers
                that allow applications to exploit the increased address space
                capabilities of the Alpha architecture and OpenVMS Alpha 
                Version 7.0 services. These features include command line
                qualifiers, #pragma directives, and run-time library 
                specifications that allow the programmer to allocate and 
                access data at run time that is to be beyond the range of 
                addressing afforded by 32-bit pointers. By default programs 
                compiled by earlier versions of the compiler or on earlier 
                versions of OpenVMS continue to behave as before, strictly 
                within 32-bit address space. Explicit use of the new compiler 
                features allow such programs to be extended to exploit the 
                extended address space with minimal changes to the source code.

          o  Storage allocation using:

             -  Reserved words (globalref, globaldef, and globalvalue) for 
                sharing data among program modules

             -  Reserved words (readonly, noshare, and psect name specification)
                for control of data attributes and data placement

             -  Reserved words (_align and __unaligned)  for specifying the 
                alignment boundaries of data objects

             -  Pragmas to control extern models and structure member alignment
                and base structure alignment

          o  Option for running only the preprocessor phase of compilation

          o  Option for generating include file dependency information to aid
             in construction of files for the DEC Module Management System

          o  Pragmas to control compiler options

          o  Compilation options allowing a choice between fast turnaround and
             optimization across compilation units

          o  Compiler generated listing file including optional:

             -  Source Code

             -  Include file contents

          DEC C for OpenVMS VAX Version 5.2                     SPD 25.38.21
          DEC C for OpenVMS Alpha Version 5.2

          o  Installation kit cooperates with DEC C++ for OpenVMS VAX and 
             OpenVMS Alpha systems

          Compatibility with Other C Implementations

          DEC C is a conforming hosted implementation of ANSI X3.159-1989 
          Programming Language C (ISO 9899:1990[1992]). It can operate in four 
          different modes: strict ANSI compatibility, relaxed ANSI compatibility
          (ANSI plus Digital extensions), VAX C compatibility mode, and common
          C (pcc) compatibility mode. The VAX C and common C modes provide many
          features to ease porting from other environments.

          While many programs written in C for other compilers can be 
          successfully recompiled under DEC C, some incompatibilities among 
          implementations exist.

          Run-Time Library for C Applications

          With the exception of OpenVMS VAX Operating Systems prior to V6.1, the
          complete DEC C Run-Time Library that is needed for use with DEC C is
          distributed with the OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha Operating Systems.
          The DEC C Run-Time Library provides shareable routines to perform 
          input/output, character and string handling, mathematical 
          computations, memory allocation, and emulation of selected UNIX 
          features.

          Run-time Library Redistribution for Older OpenVMS VAX Operating 
          Systems

          For OpenVMS VAX Operating Systems V5.5-2 - V6.0, the DEC C VAX kit
          includes a separately packaged save set that contains all the run-time
          components needed to execute programs developed with the DEC C 
          compiler and class libraries. (These components are included with the 
          OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha Operating Systems Versions 6.1 and 
          subsequent).

          Digital grants you a nonexclusive, royalty-free, world right to 
          reproduce and distribute this save-set portion of the DEC C kit 
          designated as AACRT060.A (the "RTL") provided that you:

          o  distribute the entire RTL save set and copies of its accompanying
             installation documentation;

          should be run on configurations with the appropriate hardware 
          support for the floating-point data types being used. Consult the 
          base operating system Software Product Description (SPD) for the 
          appropriate floating-point accelerator or other floating-point 
          hardware appropriate for your configuration.
