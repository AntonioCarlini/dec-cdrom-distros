 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC BASIC for OpenVMS                   SPD 25.36.26

 This Software Product Description describes the following two prod-
 ucts:

 o  DEC BASIC Version 1.1 for OpenVMS Alpha Systems

 o  VAX BASIC Version 3.7 for OpenVMS VAX Systems

 DESCRIPTION

 BASIC is a shareable language processor for the OpenVMS Operating Sys-
 tem. It can be invoked as a compiler and the resulting modules can be
 linked and run using standard OpenVMS commands. BASIC provides high-
 performance for application development by generating inline native
 mode instructions. BASIC is also integrated with various programming
 productivity tools such as the OpenVMS Symbolic Debugger, DEC Language-
 Sensitive Editor (LSE), DEC Source Code Analyzer (SCA) and the Per-
 formance and Coverage Analyzer.

 BASIC is integrated into the Common Language Environment. This inte-
 gration provides BASIC users with:

 o  support for OpenVMS interlanguage calling standard

 o  access to all OpenVMS system services

 o  access to the facilities of the OpenVMS Symbolic Debugger

 o  Callable interfaces to the OpenVMS Common Run-Time Library

 o  Support for the Language-Sensitive Editor

 o  Structured Programming Constructs

    -  Line numbers completely optional.

       DIMENSION, EXTERNAL, FUNCTION, MAP, RECORD and SUB statements.

    -  Default data allocation rules can be specified with DCL qual-
       ifiers, BASIC commands, or by the OPTION statement in program
       text.

    -  By default all declarations are implicit, however, the OPTION
       TYPE = EXPLICIT can be used to require explicit declaration of
