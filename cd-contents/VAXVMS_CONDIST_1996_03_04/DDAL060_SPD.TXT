 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC Data Distributor Version 6.0        SPD 27.76.09
                for OpenVMS VAX

 DESCRIPTION

 DEC Data Distributor manages the distribution of relational data. Op-
 erations called transfers define what data and data definitions are
 to be moved (the source) and where they are to be moved to (the tar-
 get). The target need not be on the same system or be the same data
 management system as the source.

 Distributing data in this way has several benefits, particularly when
 the target is on a different system from the source:

 o  Users can query a database local to them rather than having to ac-
    cess a remote database. This provides faster and more regular ac-
    cess.

 o  Congestion on the source database is reduced as a result of the use
    of the target.

 Data Sources, Targets and Gateway Dependencies

 The following table lists the DEC Data Distributor sources and tar-
 gets and the DEC DB Integrator (DBI) gateways, if any, required to ac-
 cess them.

 Methods of Data Distribution

 There are three transfer types: extraction, extraction rollup, and repli-
 cation. For each type of transfer, the source can be all the table def-
 initions and data within the source database or databases, or a sub-
 set of those definitions and data.

 Extraction

 ____________________
 The   use of a particular database or file system as a source or a tar-
   get depends on the version of the DBI gateway used.  Refer to the OP-
   TIONAL SOFTWARE section of this SPD for the DBI gateway products and

   versions required to achieve the capabilities listed here.
 DEC   DB Gateway for Custom Drivers provides tools that enable access

   to data sources that lack turn-key DBI Gateway solutions.
 Note   that transfer of data to a DEC DB Integrator target database is
   contingent upon the capabilities of the underlying link databases and
   the gateways that access them.  For example, if the DEC DB Integra-
   tor logical database is linked to an IBM DB2 database, which can be
   a target of Data Distributor transfers, then the transfer to the DEC
   DB Integrator database can succeed.  By contrast, if for example the
   logical database is based on links to RMS or VSAM files, which can-
   not be the target of Data Distributor transfers, the transfer to the

   DEC DB Integrator database would fail.

                                  2

 

 The target can be a set of tables in any of the target databases iden-
 tified in Table 1. Each time the transfer executes, the existing data
 in these tables is deleted and replaced with current data from the source.

 Optionally, the target may be a DEC Rdb database, as opposed to ta-
 bles in a DEC Rdb database. In this case a new version of the database
 is created every time the transfer executes.

 Users can update any of the target tables, provided that they have ac-
 cess privilege to do so. If Data Distributor recreates the database
 files when the transfer next executes, the user updates will not ap-
 pear in the target database. If the transfer does not create new database
 files but the user updates were to transferred tables, the user up-
 dates will not appear when the table data is refreshed. User updates
 are preserved when they are to tables not targeted by Data Distrib-
 utor transfers and the target files are not recreated with each sub-
 sequent transfer execution.

 Extraction Rollup

 The extraction rollup function has the same range of source databases
 as the extraction function. However, an extraction rollup has more than
 one source database. The source databases can be of different types,
 for example, one DEC Rdb database and one DB2 database.

 The target must be a DEC Rdb database. A new version of the target database
 is created every time the transfer executes. The result of an extrac-
 tion rollup, like that of an extraction, can be updated by users, but
 those updates will not be reflected in the new database created when
 the next transfer executes.

 Replication

 A replication transfer initially moves all source data to the target.
 Subsequent executions of a replication transfer post only the changes
 made to the source database since the last transfer was executed. Data
 rows deleted on the source database may be deleted on the target or
 flagged as archived data. The source of a replication transfer must


                                  3

 

 be a DEC Rdb database. The target can be any of the targets identi-
 fied in Table 1. If necessary, the target can be rebuilt by reinitial-
 izing the transfer.

 Tables that are targets of replication transfers should not be updated.

 Other Features

 Schedules

 Each transfer may have a schedule that specifies the times and inter-
 vals at which a transfer will execute. A transfer may also be executed
 anytime on demand, whether or not a transfer schedule is defined.

 Pre- and Post-Transfer Command Procedures

 A transfer can have associated with it DCL command procedures that ex-
 ecute before and/or after a transfer executes. Potential uses of such
 procedures include:

 o  Making the network between the source and target systems available

 o  Notifying users by electronic mail that the transfer has completed
    and reporting on completion status

 o  Creating indexes on tables in the target database

 Multiple Transfers

 A database can be the source for more than one transfer. For example,
 a DEC Rdb database could be the source for a replication of some ta-
 bles, an extraction of some columns from other tables, and also one
 of the source databases for an extraction rollup including yet another
 subset of the data.

 Because the target of an extraction or replication can be a set of ta-
 bles in an existing database, such a database can be the target of more
 than one transfer. However, it cannot be the target of an extraction
 rollup, and no table within the database can be the target of more than
 one transfer.

                                  4

 

 A database can be both a source and a target database. For example,
 a database may be the target of a replication transfer, and may also
 be the source of other replications.

 Centralized Storage of DEC Data Distributor Information

 Transfer and schedule definitions and the status of every transfer are
 consolidated in a DEC Rdb database known as the transfer database.

 VMScluster systems may contain both VAX and AXP processors. In a sin-
 gle VMScluster system, VAX computers running DEC Data Distributor and
 AXP computer systems running DEC Data Distributor share a single cluster-
 wide transfer database. They also share in the scheduling and execu-
 tion of transfers.

 Syntax

 DEC SQL includes DEC Data Distributor statements, such as:

 o  CREATE TRANSFER, in which the source and target are specified. Spec-
    ification of the source includes selecting the tables, and the rows
    and columns of those tables, to be transferred.

 o  CREATE SCHEDULE, in which the frequency of execution is specified.

 o  SHOW TRANSFER, which displays the definition of the transfer and
    that of the associated schedule if there is one, and the status of
    the transfer, including the date and time at which it last executed.

 Security

 To create a transfer, it is necessary to have SELECT access to the source
 database and to the tables transferred. To create a replication trans-
 fer, it is also necessary to have CREATE privilege on the source database.

 If the target database is created by DEC Data Distributor, it is cre-
 ated with the DEC Rdb default protection. If it is necessary to be more
 restrictive for an extraction or replication, the database can be cre-
 ated in advance and the target specified as tables within it. Tables
 are always created with the default protection of the target database
 system. This can be altered in a posttransfer DCL command procedure.

                                  5

 

 The data in the transfer database is protected from direct access by
 users lacking the required privileges.

 Portability and Interoperability

 DEC Data Distributor is available on both OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS AXP
 system platforms. DEC Rdb databases, DB Integrator and the DB Inte-
 grator gateways on both of these platforms provide a wide range of tar-
 gets and sources for extraction and targets for replication transfers.

 Relationships with Other Products

 DEC Data Distributor requires DEC Rdb. It can be used with any one of
 the three DEC Rdb packaging options. Sites may use the DEC SQL inter-
 face to tailor target databases by creating indexes etc.

 Because DEC SQL can perform operations on remote as well as local databases,
 the operations can be performed from another node on the network to
 nodes that only have a Run-Time license for the target product.

 If CDD/Repository is present on the target system, data definitions
 from DEC Rdb target databases can be placed in the dictionary by us-
 ing the INTEGRATE statement of the DEC SQL utility.

 DEC Data Distributor for OpenVMS VAX can schedule and execute trans-
 fers between DEC DB Integrator, DEC DB Integrator gateways or DEC Rdb
 servers running on OpenVMS VAX or OpenVMS AXP systems.

 Where to Install DEC Data Distributor

 It is not necessary to install DEC Data Distributor on every system
 involved in a transfer. It must be installed on:

 o  The source system of a replication transfer

 o  Either the source or the target system of an extraction or extrac-
    tion rollup transfer. (It may be installed on both.)

 Limitations

                                  6

 

 Because DEC Data Distributor uses a cluster-wide transfer database,
 only one version of DEC Data Distributor is allowed in a VMScluster
 or VAXcluster system.

 Row selection, conditional and value expressions available in a trans-
 fer definition are a subset of those supported by the source database
 management system.

 Indexes, constraints, triggers, collating sequences, stored procedures,
 external functions and access privileges are not copied from source
 to target databases.

 DEC Data Distributor does not provide commit-time replication of changes.
 That is, updates to the source are transferred to the target when a
 replication transfer executes, not whenever an update transaction is
 committed on the source database.

 DEC Data Distributor does not support DEC SERdb for Security-Enhanced
 VMS.

 CONFORMANCE TO STANDARDS

 DEC Data Distributor extends the functions of DEC SQL to cover the sched-
 uled transfer of data between databases. These functions are not ad-
 dressed by the current ANSI/ISO standards for SQL.
