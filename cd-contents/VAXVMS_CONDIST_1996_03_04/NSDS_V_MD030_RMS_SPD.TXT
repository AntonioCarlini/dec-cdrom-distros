   PRODUCT NAME:  DEC DB Integrator Gateway for RMS       SPD 32.88.07
                  Version 3.0D for OpenVMS

   DESCRIPTION

   DEC DB Integrator Gateway for RMS for OpenVMS (RMS Gateway) provides
   applications and tools with direct read/write access to local Open-
   VMS Record Management Services (RMS) files and read/only access re-
   mote RMS files and IBM[R] MVS and VM/CMS data sets. These data sources
   may be accessed through either the gateway's interactive or dynamic
   SQL interfaces. Client/server access is supported through the SQL/Services
   facility and a driver for Microsoft[R] Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
   clients. Optional support for embedded SQL and SQL module language pro-
   gramming is available.

   The RMS Gateway stores the metadata used to describe the RMS files in
   either as CDD/Repository objects or in ASCII text files (in CDD for-
   mat). When metadata is stored as ASCII text files the RMS Gateway ac-
   cesses those files directly, without requiring the use of CDD/Repository.

   When used in conjunction with DEC DB Integrator (DBI) and other DBI
   gateways, the RMS Gateway enables the integration of RMS files and IBM
   MVS and VM/CMS data sets, with data from other relational and non-relational
   data sources including: SYBASE[R], ORACLE7[R], Informix[R], IBM DB2[TM],
   Oracle Rdb, DEC DBMS and DEC DSM databases.

   The RMS Gateway runs under the OpenVMS operating system on Digital Al-
   pha and VAX systems, servers and workstations.

   Version 3.0D for OpenVMS

   Components

   Non-SQL Data Server

   The Non-SQL Data Server is the component that brings data and their
   definitions (metadata) together and makes them appear relational. The
   Non-SQL Data Server enables applications to access this non-relational
   data in a relational manner. The Non-SQL Data Server plans, optimizes,
   and executes read and write operations.

   RMS Driver

   The RMS driver contains the code specific to accessing RMS files and
   IBM MVS data sets. It utilizes RMS indexes in accessing the data when
   appropriate.

   Metadata Drivers

   The CDD/Repository for VMS driver contains the code specific to ac-
   cessing metadata in a CDD/Repository.

   The CDO source file driver contains the code specific to accessing meta-
   data directly from CDO statements in text files.

   Features

   Relational Access to Non-Relational Data
   The RMS Gateway allows applications to read and write to local RMS files
   using standard SQL syntax and programming interfaces. Transaction sup-
   port is provided by using DECdtm and RMS Journaling. The SQL "reserv-
   ing" option can be used when starting transactions to specify file ac-
   cess modes. Access to remote RMS files is limited to read-only.

   The RMS Gateway supports relational access to indexed, sequential and
   relative RMS files with fixed length records or with variable length
   records with fixed length control. Support for variable length and stream
   record formats is limited to the fixed portion of those records as de-
   fined in CDD/Repository or CDO statements in text files.

   Version 3.0D for OpenVMS

   Read-only only access to IBM MVS and VM/CMS data sets (including VSAM)
   is provided through the DECnet/SNA Data Transfer Facility (DTF). For
   more information regarding file access using DTF, refer to the DEC-
   net/SNA Data Transfer Facility Software Product Description (SPD 27.85.xx).

   SQL Programming Interfaces

   The RMS Gateway includes interactive and dynamic SQL interfaces. The
   included SQL/Services facility supports the client/server implemen-
   tation style.

   o  The interactive SQL interface provides SQL data manipulation lan-
      guage (DML) support for insert, select, update, delete, join, project
      and order operations.

   o  The dynamic SQL interface compiles and executes SQL requests passed
      through its call interface. This programming approach is highly ef-
      fective in applications such as ad-hoc query where the exact pa-
      rameters of requests are not known until runtime. It is compati-
      ble with any programming language that supports the OpenVMS call-
      ing standard. The dynamic memory handling capabilities of Ada, PL/I
      and C enable these languages to take full advantage of the power
      and flexibility of this approach.

   o  The RMS Gateway performs data format translations for supported VMS
      data types as part of processing requests to read or update data.

   Desktop Connectivity

   Microsoft Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) applications can read from,
   and write to, RMS files and VM/CMS data sets using the DEC ODBC Driver
   for MS[R] Windows[TM]. This driver provides access to SQL/Services servers
   over DECnet or TCP/IP network transports. This driver also provides
   these applications with access to DB Integrator and the other DB In-
   tegrator Gateways.

   Distributed Data Access

   The RMS Gateway supports access from remote clients and to remote RMS
   databases.

   Integration with DEC SQL Applications

   RMS Gateway data sources are accessible by Digital information man-
   agement and end-user data access tools.

   o  DEC Data Distributor can maintain extracts and rollups of RMS Gate-
      way tables and views.

   o  DATATRIEVE queries, reports, and updates can combine data from RMS
      Gateways, DB Integrator, and other DB Integrator Gateways.

   Data Dictionary Support

   The optional use of Oracle's CDD/Repository with the RMS Gateway en-
   courages consolidated maintenance of data definitions in a repository
   where they can be shared by all applications, databases and program-
   ming tools that use them.

   Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1)

   Disk space required for     45,000 blocks
   installation:
                               (22 MB)

   Disk space required for     32,000 blocks
   use (permanent):
                               (16 MB)

   Approximately 28,000 blocks (14 MB) of the permanent requirement is
   for software components common to DEC DB Integrator (DBI) and the DBI
   family of gateways. If one of these products has already been installed
   on a system, the additional disk space required by this product will
   be reduced by approximately that (14 MB) amount.

   These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
   sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
   system environment, configuration, and software options selected.
