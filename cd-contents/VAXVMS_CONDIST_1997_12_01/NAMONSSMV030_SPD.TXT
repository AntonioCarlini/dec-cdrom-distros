PRODUCT NAME:  DIGITAL Enterprise Mail Monitor, Version 3.0
SPD 64.80.00

DESCRIPTION

DIGITAL[TM] Enterprise Mail Monitor is a management software appli-
cation that allows network management staff to monitor and manage mes-
saging systems and network applications across local and wide-area net-
works from a central location. The application is based on the client/server
model and runs on OpenVMS[TM] VAX[TM], OpenVMS Alpha, DIGITAL UNIX[R],
and Windows NT[TM] Intel[R] and Alpha.

An easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) provides a color-coded
real-time display of the current status of the systems and applica-
tions. Operators can quickly pinpoint and fix potential or existing
problems before they impact network performance and before users even
notice that there is a problem.

DIGITAL Enterprise Mail Monitor includes the following components:

o  A client, which connects to one or more servers to obtain monitor-
   ing information, and displays the results to the user via the GUI.

o  A server, which handles client requests for information. The server
   triggers entity scanning activities and returns the results to each
   client that requested information about an entity.

o  Scanning modules, which monitor entities under the control of a server
   and return the information obtained.


                                                          July 1997

DIGITAL Enterprise Mail Monitor, Version 3.0           SPD 64.80.00


FEATURES

A Wide Range of Scanning Modules

Scanning modules are provided for DIGITAL MAILbus products and many
of DIGITAL's network applications. Operators can define scanning in-
tervals to determine how frequently products are monitored and can also
choose to monitor an entity continuously.

In addition, a Software Developer's Kit (SDK) is optionally available
to allow users to easily create and integrate new scanning modules.

A Wide Range of Events Can be Monitored

DIGITAL Enterprise Mail Monitor can monitor the following types of event:

o  Message queue congestion, message trace details, and the existence
   of bad-message files

o  Message Traffic

o  Logical names and devices

o  Missing files and database records

o  Application counters and logs

o  Processes and batch jobs

o  DECnet-Plus event logging

o  Event logging and Performance Counter on Windows NT.

Problems Can be Fixed Before Users are Affected

An alarm module ensures that problems can be pinpointed before users
are affected and action can be taken to fix the problems.

Management Scanning Module

The following Scanning Modules are included in the Server and are par-
ticularly useful in an IP environment:

o  PING - Check host reachability; measure system performance.

o  ISM - Check subnet consistencies.

o  DNS - Check DEC[TM] Distributed Naming Service.

o  CONTROL - Manages remote applications.

Graphical User Interface

A GUI allows operators to easily and quickly configure DIGITAL Enter-
prise Mail Monitor. When configured, operators use the GUI to deter-
mine problem areas at a glance. The display can be customized using
filters. Color-coding and alarms highlight problems. Histograms show
the number of problems and the severity of each problem. Detailed re-
ports can be displayed on the screen.

Detailed Reports

Detailed reports provide a snapshot of the performance and volume of
traffic on each Message Transfer System. The operator can control the
severity level of information displayed.

Secure Remote Management

DIGITAL Enterprise Mail Monitor Management Module provides secure re-
mote execution of commands on the servers, for example, it allows you
to start and stop monitored products.

Interface to Manager on NetView

Interface to Manager on NetView[R] is possible by redirecting client
output into a file. The output can be processed by a script which con-
tains SNMP-TRAP commands.
