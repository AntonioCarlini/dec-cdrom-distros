DESCRIPTION

PrintServer Software is a layered product that enables one or both of
the following:

o  Suitably configured systems to communicate in an Ethernet network
   to a PrintServer 17, PrintServer 17/600, PrintServer 20, turbo PrintServer
   20, PrintServer 32, PrintServer 32 plus, or PrintServer 40 plus printer.
   Users in an Ethernet network can communicate with, print to, mon-
   itor, and gather accounting information from any of these PrintServer
   printers. These are called the supporting host services.

o  Suitably configured systems in an Ethernet local area network (LAN)
   to initialize (boot) and provide support functions for the PrintServer
   17, PrintServer 17/600, PrintServer 20, turbo PrintServer 20, PrintServer
   32, PrintServer 32 plus, and PrintServer 40 plus. Users in an Eth-
   ernet LAN can initialize (boot) and provide print client services
   to any of these PrintServer printers.

In general, there are two primary components included in PrintServer
Software: print client software and supporting host software.

Print Client Software

Print client software consists of the following components:

o  Print filters or interface programs to process requests from one
   or more printer queues.

o  Network software to transmit print requests and associated data over
   the Ethernet network to a remote PrintServer printer. OpenVMS, UL-
   TRIX, and Windows NT clients support both DECnet and TCP/IP pro-
   tocols. All other UNIX and NetWare clients support only TCP/IP.

o  Translators that automatically convert file formats into the PostScript[R]
   page description language.

                                 2

 

o  Event logging that captures error and status information and de-
   livers it to specified users and/or operators.

o  Print client and local accounting for tracking printer usage.

o  Online help or manual pages providing help for the user.

o  Installation scripts and/or instructions.

The print client software must reside on each system or file server
that prints directly or provides distributed printing services for other
systems (remote spooling) to Digital's PrintServer printers. A sys-
tem running the print client software can transmit print requests to
any suitably configured PrintServer printer defined in the system's
network database.

The maximum number of print clients that can be connected to a PrintServer
is as follows.

o  PrintServer 20 series - 16 simultaneous client connections

o  PrintServer 32 series - 16 simultaneous client connections

o  PrintServer 40 plus - 16 simultaneous client connections

o  PrintServer 17 series - depends on amount of memory in the printer

Supporting Host Software

Supporting host software consists of the following components:

o  PostScript and PCL interpreters.

o  Printer Status Manager (PRISM).

o  A primary boot system image file that is downloaded into the PrintServer
   printer when the printer is powered on or remotely triggered.

o  A management client that loads the secondary boot files and printer
   configuration files and provides for the capture and storage of cen-
   tralized accounting and event log information from the printer.

                                 3

 

o  A remote management utility that allows remote monitoring and man-
   aging of a PrintServer printer from a terminal, workstation, or PC
   on either a print client or supporting host system (except for Win-
   dows NT).

o  PrintServer system software that provides communications services,
   remote management services, and PostScript and PCL interpreters.
   The interpreters process PostScript and PCL commands and generate
   imaging data for the printer controller.

If multiple PrintServer printers reside on the same LAN, one or more
supporting hosts can be used to load and/or manage them. A single sup-
porting host can service any number of PrintServer printers; conversely,
a number of supporting hosts can service a single printer to provide
a high degree of fault tolerance.

Print Client Features

The print client features described in this SPD are available for the
following platforms: HP-UX, IBM-AIX, NetWare, OSF/1, SCO UNIX, SCO UNIX
/DECadvantage, Silicon Graphics IRIX, Solaris, SunOS, ULTRIX, and Win-
dows NT.
In a NetWare operating environment, the print client requires bindery
emulation to be enabled for all NetWare 4.nn servers that are to be
used with this software. Bindery emulation is enabled by default in
some 4.nn installations.

In an OpenVMS operating environment, the print client software is pro-
vided through DECprint Supervisor for OpenVMS. The media and documen-
tation for DECprint Supervisor for OpenVMS are bundled with the PrintServer
Software for OpenVMS (and available separately). Refer to the Soft-
ware Product Description (SPD 44.15.nn) for more information on DECprint
Supervisor for OpenVMS.

In an ULTRIX operating environment, the print client software is pro-
vided through the ULTRIX operating system. The license to use this soft-
ware is bundled with the ULTRIX operating system.

Printer Interface

                                 4

 

PrintServer Software provides an interface to your operating system.
The interface transmits print requests over the Ethernet network to
the printer and relays system messages from the printer to the spool-
ing system and/or requesting user.

PrintServer Software allows users to print non-PostScript documents
(with the exception of PCL5) by translating the text into PostScript.
Translation can be requested explicitly on the command line or per-
formed automatically when the document is printed. PCL5 files are sent
directly to the PrintServer 17 family of printers, turbo PrintServer
20, and PrintServer 32 plus printers without translation. ASCII trans-
lation is provided for all operating environments. ANSI translation
is provided for the OpenVMS, OSF/1, and ULTRIX operating environments.

In a Windows NT operating environment and in applications, transla-
tion occurs automatically when your application submits a print job
to the spooling system. The spooling system provides the printer with
all the fonts required to print the job successfully.

The NetWare operating environment provides a PrintServer-specific Printer
Description File (PDF) containing modes and functions to select var-
ious PrintServer features and options.

Print drivers for Macintosh[TM] systems and Microsoft[R] Windows[TM]
3.1 are also provided. The drivers allow you to:

o  Print PostScript and PCL jobs faster

o  Use two or more paper trays, print duplex (two-sided), and incor-
   porate print enhancement technologies

o  Save PostScript and PCL files in a variety of portable formats

o  Maintain separate printer settings for each PostScript printer, mak-
   ing it easy to use two or more PostScript printers with the same
   computer

o  Use PostScript Level 1 and Level 2


                                 5

 

In a SCO UNIX/DECadvantage operating environment, an interface pro-
gram allows users to print images (CCITT Group 3 and Group 4) at near
engine speed on the PostScript Level 1 versions of the following print-
ers: PrintServer 17, turbo PrintServer 20, and PrintServer 32 print-
ers.

In an ULTRIX/VAX operating environment, ANSI, TEKTRONIX[R], and ReGIS
translators are also provided. Refer to the Software Product Descrip-
tion (SPD 26.40.nn) for more information.

Many of the options above are supported through applications with na-
tive support in some operating systems.

In UNIX environments, the output can be directed not only to a print
queue, but also to a file for printing later on a Digital PostScript
printer.

Supporting Host Features

The supporting host features are described below:

PostScript

PostScript is a device-independent, page description language that de-
scribes the appearance of text, images, and graphic material on the
printed page.

The PostScript language's page description capabilities include the
following features, which can be used in any combination:

o  Arbitrary shapes constructed from straight lines, arcs, and cubic
   curves. Such shapes can self-intersect and contain disconnected sec-
   tions and holes.


                                 7

 

o  Painting primitives that permit a shape to be outlined with lines
   of any thickness, filled with any gray shade, or used as a clip-
   ping path to crop any other graphics.

o  Text fully integrated with graphics. Text characters are treated
   as graphical shapes that can be operated on by any PostScript graph-
   ics operator.

o  Sampled images derived from natural sources or generated synthet-
   ically. The PostScript graphics model allows sampled images at any
   resolution and with a variety of dynamic ranges, and it provides
   a number of facilities to control the rendering of images on the
   PrintServer printer.

o  A general coordinate system facility that supports all combinations
   of linear transformations including translation, scaling, rotation,
   reflection, and skewing. These transformations apply uniformly to
   all elements of a page description, including text, graphical shapes,
   and sampled images.

o  A rendering algorithm, DECimage Plus, that enhances the quality of
   natural (halftone) images when printed on laser printers.

PostScript Level 2 extends the functional range of the PostScript lan-
guage by adding new features designed to more conveniently and effi-
ciently describe the appearance of the page. PostScript Level 2 fea-
tures include:

o  Form and pattern caching, which drastically reduces print times where
   repetitive elements, such as corporate logos or accent bars, are
   printed on successive pages.

o  ATM font rendering, which provides higher quality and is notably
   faster than the rendering mechanism in PostScript Level 1.

o  Data-compression and decompression filters for several industry-
   standard formats (i.e. CCITT Group 3 and Group 4), which enable much
   faster data transmission times and reduces storage requirements for
   PostScript files.

                                 8

 

o  Improved printer-based memory management, which facilitates the print-
   ing of complex pages in less time.

PostScript Level 2 is provided for the PrintServer 17 family of print-
ers, turbo PrintServer 20 (with firmware version 3.7 and a minimum of
16 MB of memory), and PrintServer 32 plus printers. (PostScript Level
2 is provided for the turbo PrintServer 20 and the PrintServer 32 plus
printers for those platforms that offer the V5.1 version of PrintServer
software). PostScript Level 1 is provided for all other Digital PrintServer
printers.

PCL5

PCL5 interpretation is provided for the PrintServer 17 (with at least
12 MB memory), PrintServer 17/600, turbo PrintServer 20, and PrintServer
32 plus printers in HP-UX, IBM-AIX, NetWare, OpenVMS, OSF/1, Silicon
Graphics IRIX, Solaris, SunOS, and Windows NT operating environments.
[Note: PrintServer 17/600 PostScript Level 2 printers that use SNMP
and PCL5 require 20 MB memory.]

The PCL5 interpreter supports HP LaserJet IIIsi emulation as described
in the HP PCL5 Printer Language Technical Reference Manual and as im-
plemented in the HP LaserJet IIIsi printer. PCL5 files are passed di-
rectly to the PCL5 interpreter in the printer and processed for print-
ing (versus being translated on the host system). PCL5 supports in-
terpretation and the printing of both 300 and 600 dpi files.

PrintServer Software allows users to print PCL5 documents on PrintServer
17, PrintServer 17/600, turbo PrintServer 20, and PrintServer 32 plus
printers. Interpretation is performed in the printer (versus being trans-
lated on the host system) when the document is printed.

Resident scaleable typefaces include:

o  Univers[R] Medium

o  Univers Medium Italic

o  Univers Bold

o  Univers Bold Italic

                                 9

o  Times Bold

o  Times Bold Italic

o  Univers Condensed[R]

o  Univers Condensed Italic

o  Univers Condensed Bold

o  ITC Zapf Dingbats[R]

Bitmap font support includes:

o  Courier[R] 10 pitch 12 point (italic, bold)

o  Courier 12 pitch 10 point (italic, bold)

o  Line Printer 16.66 pitch 8.5 point (landscape, portrait)

Image Printing

An image PDL is provided for the turbo PrintServer 20 and PrintServer
32 printers in an OpenVMS operating environment and for the PrintServer
17, turbo PrintServer 20, and PrintServer 32 printers in the SCO UNIX
/DECadvantage operating environment. (Image printing for PostScript
Level 2 printers is handled by the PostScript Level 2 interpreter.)
The image PDL greatly reduces the printing time on PostScript Level
1 printers for Digital Document Interchange Format (DDIF) compressed
bitonal image files, such as those created by certain scanning devices.
The use of the image PDL passes files directly to the image decompres-
sion chip in the printer, bypassing and eliminating conversion to PostScript.

The image PDL provides the following features:

o  Uses the printer's hardware decompression capability for faster print-
   ing

                                10

 

o  Automatically rotates and crops images to fit paper size and ori-
   entation

o  Automatically scales 200 dpi A-size images to 300 dpi A-size im-
   ages

o  Supports CCITT compression standards: CCITT G42D, CCITT G31D, and
   CCITT G32D

o  Supports different media sizes, depending on the PrintServer printer

Remote Management Services

A management facility enables the remote management and monitoring of
the PrintServer printers. There are two levels of command:

o  Unprivileged - Anyone may use these commands.

o  Privileged - You must enter a password to use these commands.

Unprivileged commands include:

reboot________Remotely_reboots_the_PrintServer_printer_____________

The remote management facility is available in the following styles:

o  GUI interface for Motif platforms

o  A command-line interface for character-cell terminals

o  A Windows interface for PC platforms (monitoring only for PC plat-
   forms)

The PrintServer 17, PrintServer 17/600, PrintServer 20, turbo PrintServer
20, PrintServer 32, and PrintServer 32 plus printers have front pan-
els with a 2 x 24 character LCD display that provides system status
information. Front panel status messages can be displayed in English,
French, German, Dutch, Swedish, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, or Nor-
wegian. (The remote console is not available for Windows NT.)

PRISM

The Printer Status Manager (PRISM) allows you to monitor all supported
PrintServer printers on your network. PRISM displays the current sta-
tus of the printers, such as printing, processing, out of paper, or
jammed. This saves you from having to check the front panel of each
printer or the remote console facility for printer status. PRISM en-
ables you to:

                                12

 

o  Select the printers you wish to monitor

o  Group the printers by floor, building, printer type, etc.

o  Identify problems at a glance using colors to indicate problem sever-
   ity

o  Determine printer status

Simple Network Management Protocol

SNMP allows network managers to integrate PrintServer printers into
SNMP-based network management programs. PrintServer Software supports
an SNMP agent for all PrintServer printers, except the PrintServer 40
series, PrintServer 20, and Printserver 17 with 8 MB of memory. The
agent supports MIB-II.

Centralized Event Logging

PrintServer Software logs events ranging from successful completion
of jobs to hardware errors. Events can be recorded in an event log file
on a management client system. Management clients on multiple systems
can simultaneously receive event logging data from a single PrintServer
printer. These events are also displayed on remote management termi-
nals and the PrintServer 40 local console. A subset of event messages
is displayed on the remote console and front panel of the PrintServer
17, PrintServer 17/600, PrintServer 20, turbo PrintServer 20, PrintServer
32, and PrintServer 32 plus printers. The command to display logging
information on the remote console is a privileged command in a Win-
dows environment.

Centralized Accounting

Similar to event logging, accounting information is sent to any man-
agement client that requests accounting data upon connecting to a PrintServer
printer. PrintServer Software contains its own accounting utility, pro-
viding the system manager with a convenient way to analyze and report
printer usage or cross-charge users and departments for printer us-
age.

                                13

 

The accounting utility prepares usage reports for a specific PrintServer
printer on a per-user and per-host basis. Accounting information in-
cludes user name, originating host, total number of sheets and sides
printed, sheet size, and printer CPU time. The utility allows the sys-
tem manager to assign cost to the number of sheets printed, the num-
ber of sides printed, and/or CPU time used. The utility also allows
for reporting to begin from a specific date. In addition, data is stored
in a specific format to allow third-party applications to read and/or
manipulate information.

The accounting utility is not available in an AT&T Unison operating
environment because the Unison operating system controls accounting.

Controlled Access to a PrintServer Printer

PrintServer Software provides a convenient way to control network ac-
cess to a PrintServer printer. Access to the printer is specified in
the printer configuration file by either "allowing" or "denying" ac-
cess by a client host. The "allow" option allows specified DECnet area
numbers or node addresses and Internet host addresses, networks, or
subnetwork numbers to communicate with the PrintServer printer. The
"deny" option prohibits nodes, areas, hosts, networks, and subnetworks
from communicating with the printer.

Downloading the PrintServer Image

A PrintServer printer is booted in two phases: the primary boot and
the secondary boot. During the primary boot, a supporting host down-
loads the system image upon receipt of a MOP, bootp, or uniboot pro-
tocol load request by the printer. If multiple supporting hosts are
designated to boot the printer, the first system to respond to the printer
load request provides the primary boot. Once the primary boot has been
completed, a management client connects to the printer to perform the
secondary boot.

The secondary boot involves downloading configuration and setup files
and system process image files.



                                14

 

PrintServer 40 plus printers require the MOP protocol to boot. MOP is
available on Digital's ULTRIX and OpenVMS operating systems. All other
PrintServer printers accept MOP or bootp.

turbo PrintServer 20 printers require controller firmware V3.1 or higher
when booted by HP-UX, IBM-AIX, SCO UNIX, SCO UNIX/DECadvantage, Sil-
icon Graphics IRIX, and Solaris systems, or if the printer is booted
by bootp and accessed by DECnet systems.

PrintServer 20 printers must be booted by an OpenVMS, OSF/1, SunOS,
or ULTRIX system.

In a NetWare or Windows NT operating environment, turbo PrintServer
20 and PrintServer 32 series printers with PostScript Level 1 require
boot firmware V3.6 or higher. PrintServer 17 printers require boot firmware
V2.1 or higher. turbo PrintServer 20 and PrintServer 32 series print-
ers with PostScript Level 2 and the memory option board require boot
firmware V3.7. Firmware upgrade kits are available.

PrintServer System and Imaging Components

PrintServer Software and process image components are the software el-
ements that are downloaded to, and run within, a PrintServer printer.
This software consists of the following parts:

o  Communications software that accepts print and/or control data from
   Internet or DECnet client hosts and passes print data to the imag-
   ing software (PostScript or PCL5 interpreters). This software also
   passes system messages from the imaging software to the appropri-
   ate print client and/or management client and provides remote man-
   agement services.

o  Imaging software that interprets data from the communications soft-
   ware, builds the corresponding bitmaps, and sends those bitmaps to
   the print engine to be converted to printed output.

The imaging software also passes any system messages from the print
engine or interpreter to the communications software, which passes these
messages to the appropriate print, remote management, and/or manage-
ment clients running on client hosts.

                                15

 

The imaging software includes an interpreter based on the Adobe[R] PostScript
Page Description Language and resident typefaces. The PostScript Level
1 interpreter includes 29 resident typefaces. The PostScript Level 2
interpreter includes either 29 or 43 resident typefaces, depending on
the memory configuration of the printer. PostScript Level 2 support
is provided for the PrintServer 17 family of printers, turbo PrintServer
20, and PrintServer 32 plus printers in HP-UX, IBM-AIX, NetWare, Win-
dows NT, OpenVMS, OSF/1, Silicon Graphics IRIX, Solaris, SunOS, and
ULTRIX operating environments at this time. The resident typefaces are
documented below.

Typefaces for PostScript Level 1 printers include:

o  Courier (regular, Bold, Oblique, Bold Oblique)

o  Helvetica[R] (regular, Bold, Oblique, Bold Oblique)

o  ITC Avant Garde Gothic[R] (Book, Book Oblique, Demi, Demi Oblique)

o  ITC Lubalin Graph[R] (Book, Book Oblique, Demi, Demi Oblique)

o  ITC Souvenir[R] (Demi, Demi Italic, Light, Light Italic)

o  New Century Schoolbook (Roman, Bold, Italic, Bold Italic)

o  Times[R] (Roman, Bold, Italic, Bold Italic)

o  Symbol

The PrintServer 17 with 12 MB memory, the PrintServer 17/600 with 16
MB of memory, the turbo PrintServer 20 (with at least 16 MB of mem-
ory), and the PrintServer 32 plus (with at least 16 MB of memory) also
include the following PostScript Level 2 typefaces:

o  ITC Bookman[R] (Demi, Demi Italic, Light, Light Italic)

o  Helvetica Narrow (Regular, Bold, Oblique, Bold Oblique)

o  Palatino[R] (Roman, Bold, Italic, Bold Italic)

o  ITC Zapf[R] Chancery Medium Italic

o  Zapf Dingbats

                                16

 

PostScript Compatibility Module

At boot time, a PostScript compatibility module is automatically loaded
into the PrintServer printer. This file allows the correct emulation
and printing of PostScript extensions found in other PostScript de-
vices (e.g. Apple[R] LaserWriter[R]).

L. The following processors are supported in the Unison operating
   environment (for PrintServer Software, V5.0):

               Sun-4 systems
               Sun SPARCstation
               Sun SPARCserver

M. Processors supported in a Windows NT operating environment in-
   clude all Windows NT supported processors except IBM Power PC.
   A list of supported Windows NT platforms is in the Microsoft
   Windows NT Hardware Compatibility List.

PrintServer Software can be installed on those processors listed
above that meet the following criteria:

o  Ethernet controller interface

o  TK50 or TK70 tape drive, CD-ROM drive, QIC cartridge tape
   drive, DAT tape drive, or 3.5" floppy drive

o  System disk

The PrintServer Software requires a minimum of one PrintServer
printer (PrintServer 17, PrintServer 17/600, PrintServer 20,
turbo PrintServer 20, PrintServer 32, PrintServer 32 plus, or
PrintServer 40 plus) to be connected to the Ethernet physical
channel.

PrintServer 20, turbo PrintServer 20, PrintServer 32, PrintServer
32 plus, and PrintServer 40 plus printers require a transceiver
cable and an Ethernet transceiver (H4005), Local Network Intercon-
nect (DELNI), or ThinWire Ethernet Station Adapter (DECXM-AA).

PrintServer 17 and PrintServer 17/600 printers allow for direct
connection to ThickWire and ThinWire Ethernet interfaces. With the
optional communications card, the PrintServer 17 and PrintServer
17/600 printers can be connected directly to ThinWire or Twisted
Pair (10baseT) Ethernet. Please note that although both Ethernet
cards (Thick/ThinWire and Thin/Twisted Pair) have two interfaces,
only one is active at a time.
