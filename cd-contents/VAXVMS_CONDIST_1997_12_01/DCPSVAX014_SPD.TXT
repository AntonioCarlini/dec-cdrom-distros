PRODUCT NAME:  DECprint Supervisor (DCPS) for OpenVMS, SPD 44.15.06
               Version 1.4

DESCRIPTION

DECprint Supervisor (DCPS) for OpenVMS is a family of layered prod-
ucts that run on OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha systems to provide ac-
cess to selected PostScript [R] Level 1 and Level 2 printers.

The DECprint Supervisor family consists of the following products:

o  DECprint Supervisor for OpenVMS, Base (DCPS-Base)-DCPS-Base drives
   DIGITAL PostScript printers, and supports files formatted in PostScript
   and ANSI-Compliant DIGITAL Printing Protocol Level 3(DEC PPL3). It
   also supports these printers' special features, such as tray se-
   lection, two sided printing, and mailbox options for the DIGITAL
   PrintServer 32 and LN17ps printers. DCPS-Base also allows files for-
   matted in Hewlett-Packard PCL[R] 5 and PCL 5e Printer Languages (PCL
   5/5e) to be printed on DIGITAL PostScript printers that have a na-
   tive (built-in) PCL 5 or PCL 5e interpreter. See the Other Hard-
   ware Required section of the SPD for specific models. The license
   rights to this product are included with the OpenVMS operating sys-
   tem.

o  DECprint Supervisor for OpenVMS, Open (DCPS-Open)-DCPS-Open drives
   selected third party PostScript printers, and supports files for-
   matted in PostScript and ANSI (DEC PPL3). It also supports these
   printers' special features, such as tray selection and two sided
   printing. DCPS-Open allows files formatted in PCL 5 or PCL 5e to
   be printed on certain PostScript printers that have a native PCL
   5 or PCL 5e interpreter. See the Other Hardware Required section

                                                          June 1997

                                                        AE-PUM0G-TE

 

   of the SPD for specific models. You purchase the license rights for
   this product separately.

o  DECprint Supervisor for OpenVMS, Plus (DCPS-Plus)-DCPS-Plus includes
   value added features, such as number-up, layup, automatic data type
   detection, and high speed image printing, plus the full range of
   translators for the most popular printer languages. You purchase
   the license rights for this product separately. In order to use these
   advanced printing features with third-party printers, you also need
   a DCPS-Open license.

DECprint Supervisor software consists of the following components:

o  A print symbiont that processes print requests for the host on which
   it resides.

o  Software to transmit the request and associated data over the fol-
   lowing protocols:

   -  Ethernet to a PrintServer printer via DECnet or TCP/IP using Com-
      mon Printer Access Protocol (CPAP)

   -  Ethernet via TCP/IP to a printer with a network interface card
      (NIC) that supports the bi-directional raw TCP/IP socket pro-
      tocol

   -  Ethernet via TCP/IP to a printer connected to a print server or
      a terminal server that supports the bi-directional raw TCP/IP
      socket protocol

   -  AppleTalk[R] over Ethernet or LocalTalk[R]

   -  Local Area Terminal (LAT)

   -  Serial line

o  Translators to convert various non-PostScript files into the PostScript
   language for printing.

o  Page formatting capabilities such as the ability to print multi-
   ple page images on a single side of a sheet of paper, and to spec-
   ify borders, margins, and page offsets.

                                 2

 

o  A series of PostScript tools for application developers. These in-
   clude a PostScript error handler and Font Encoding Vectors for the
   ISO Latin Alphabet Number 1 (ISO 8859/1) and DIGITAL Multinational
   Character Set for use with all the PostScript text fonts that are
   built into DIGITAL's PostScript printers.

Install DECprint Supervisor software on each node that has print queues
for PostScript printers. A DCPS-Open license must be installed on each
node that has queues which connect to third-party PostScript print-
ers. However, PATHWORKS includes a license for DCPS-Open and thus sys-
tems providing printing through PATHWORKS servers to third-party print-
ers do not need a separate DCPS-Open license. A DCPS-Plus license is
required for each node that has queues that take advantage of the DCPS-
Plus features, whether they connect to DIGITAL or third-party print-
ers. To use the value added features with supported third party print-
ers, you need both the DCPS-Open and the DCPS-Plus licenses.

A system running DECprint Supervisor software can transmit print re-
quests to many DIGITAL and third party printers on a DECnet or TCP/IP
network that is defined in the network database. To communicate with
a TCP/IP connected printer, you must install DIGITAL TCP/IP Services
for OpenVMS software or Cisco MultiNet[R] for OpenVMS software. For
DIGITAL PrintServer printers, whether using the TCP/IP or DECnet pro-
tocol, you must install PrintServer Software (SPD 49.09.xx).

A system running DECprint Supervisor software can transmit print re-
quests to a supported PostScript printer in a local area network con-
nected to a print server or terminal server that supports the LAT or
raw TCP/IP socket protocols. It can also transmit print requests to
a printer with a NIC that supports the LAT or raw TCP/IP socket pro-
tocols. TCP/IP is not restricted to LAN.

A system running DECprint Supervisor software can transmit print re-
quests to any supported desktop PostScript printer on an AppleTalk net-
work. In order to communicate with a printer on an AppleTalk network,
the system must also run the AppleTalk for OpenVMS network software
that accompanies the PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Macintosh) software prod-
uct (SPD 35.09.xx).

Basic Printing Features

Basic printing features are provided by DCPS-Base for DIGITAL PostScript
printers, and by DCPS-Open for third-party PostScript printers, within
the limitations of the supported print devices. Not all basic features
are available on all supported devices.

Basic features include:

o  PostScript printing. The print symbiont passes PostScript files di-
   rectly to the printer. DECprint Supervisor does not interpret or
   translate PostScript files. Therefore, they must be created using
   standard PostScript Level 1 or Level 2 operators as defined within
   the printer itself.

o  ANSI (DEC PPL3) printing. DECprint Supervisor translates ANSI files
   into PostScript for printing on the output device. These ANSI files
   may contain ASCII text, sixel graphics, and other features of DIGITAL's
   ANSI-compliant Printing Protocol Level 3.

o  Selection of input tray via INPUT_TRAY, SHEET_SIZE, or PAGE_SIZE
   parameters, and output tray via OUTPUT_TRAY, within the limitations
   of the printer and the tray-naming conventions to provide such fea-
   tures.

o  Rotation of the page via the PAGE_ORIENTATION parameter for non-
   PostScript files only.

o  Selection of single-sided, double-sided, or tumble printing when
   available on the printer, via the SIDES parameter.

o  Formatting of ANSI text files via the /HEADER, /FORM, /SPACE, and
   /FEED qualifiers and the TAB parameter.

o  Control of ANSI file margins, page setup, and wrap or truncate op-
   tions as specified by the DEFINE/FORM command.

o  Status and error messages sent to the user's terminal, may be printed
   on the job trailer page or job log page, written to a log file, or
   displayed on the operator's console.

                                 4

 

o  Use of device control modules for basic data types via the /SETUP
   qualifier. PostScript modules may contain any PostScript operators
   supported by the printer in the printing context.

o  Collection of accounting information for each print job as follows:
   sheets of paper printed, the number of RMS Gets, and the number of
   QIO Writes.

o  Access to the PCL 5 or PCL 5e interpreter native to selected print-
   ers. Printers for which the native PCL interpreter is supported are
   listed in the Other Hardware Required section of the SPD.

o  Access to DCPS product features for printers with an AppleTalk con-
   nection in a PATHWORKS environment.

o  Support for PrintServer printers on DECnet or TCP/IP interconnects
   using CPAP protocol (TCP/IP requires DIGITAL TCP/IP Services for
   OpenVMS SPD 25.A4.xx for VAX systems or SPD 46.46.xx for Alpha sys-
   tems or Cisco Multinet for OpenVMS).

o  Support for printers via network interface cards, print servers,
   and terminal servers that support bi-directional raw TCP/IP socket.

Advanced Printing Features

Advanced printing features are provided by DCPS-Plus for either DIG-
ITAL or third-party PostScript printers, within the limitations of the
supported print devices. Third-party printers also require the DCPS-
Open license.

Advanced features include:

o  Automatic data type detection and switching. The software attempts
   to determine the data type of the file. If successful, it will au-
   tomatically translate, if necessary, and print the file. If it can-
   not determine the file data type, it will use the default data type
   defined by DATA_TYPE=AUTOMATIC.

   If the file is printed using the data type defined by DATA_TYPE=AUTOMATIC,
   the symbiont will look for a switch to PostScript command (%!) and
   continue to process the rest of the file as PostScript. This switch
   may occur only once per file. The switch to PostScript feature is

                                 5

 

   not available when DCPS uses a printer's native PCL interpreter to
   process the file.

o  Printing non-PostScript data types on the PostScript printer. Trans-
   lators are provided to translate the following data types into PostScript
   for printing:

   -  DDIF (bitonal Image subset only) This requires DECwindows soft-
      ware or DECimage Application Services (DAS), the latter of which
      is available only on OpenVMS VAX systems

   -  PCL Level 4 (as implemented on the HP [R] LaserJet [R] IID)

   -  IBM [R] Proprinter [R] XL24

   -  ReGIS (monochrome output only)

   -  TEKTRONIX [R] 4010/4014

   -  ASCII LIST translator that formats and numbers ASCII files. This
      translator numbers each line of text, creates alternating bars
      of gray and white in the background, and creates a running head
      of the file name and page number.

o  Printing two or more page images on a single side of a sheet via
   the NUMBER_UP parameter.

o  Specifying page layup features via the LAYUP_DEFINITION parameter.
   Page layup features include Borders, Margins, Margin Alternation,
   Pages Per Sheet, First Page, Page Order, and Page Grid. Layup def-
   inition options may be provided directly, as arguments to the LAYUP_
   DEFINITION parameter, or indirectly, as the contents of a file spec-
   ified by that parameter.

o  Specifying a range of pages of the file to be printed via the PAGE_
   LIMIT parameter.

o  Automatically scaling a page created for one paper size so that it
   fits on a different paper size via use of both the PAGE_SIZE and
   SHEET_SIZE parameters on the same print command.

o  Printing multiple uncollated copies of each sheet via the SHEET_
   COUNT parameter.

                                 6

 

o  Use of device control modules for all data types via the /SETUP qual-
   ifier. ANSI modules may include control sequences. PCL modules may
   include binary font data.

ANSI (DEC PPL3) Emulation

Printing of ANSI text and sixel graphics is compatible with DIGITAL's
ANSI-compliant PPL3 printers.

Note: PostScript printers differ in the amount of virtual memory they
have available for printing and font storage. Files which require down-
loading of fonts may be printed differently, may print more slowly,
or may fail to print, on some printers.

Third-Party Printing Devices

The DCPS-Open license extends to selected third-party PostScript print-
ers the support equivalent to that provided for a similar DIGITAL printer
with the DCPS-Base license, within the capability of the third-party
printer.

The Other Hardware Required section of the SPD lists the supported third-
party printers. DIGITAL makes no representation relative to the use
of this product to drive PostScript devices not listed in this SPD.
The use of the DCPS-Open product to drive PostScript devices not listed
on this SPD is not warranted nor supported.
