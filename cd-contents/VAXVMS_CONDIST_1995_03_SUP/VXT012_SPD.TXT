 PRODUCT NAME:  VXT Software, Version 2.1               SPD 31.34.05            
                                                                                
 DESCRIPTION                                                                    
                                                                                
 The VXT Software supports each member of the VXT 2000 family of X Win-         
 dowing Terminals. It enables a user to access data and applications            
 on UNIX[R], DEC OSF/1 AXP, ULTRIX and OpenVMS host systems by estab-           
 lishing one or many X Window System sessions over Ethernet using TCP           
 /IP, DECnet or LAT protocols. Users can also create terminal emula-            
 tion sessions to host systems over Ethernet using Telnet, DECnet and           
 LAT protocols. A single terminal emulation session can be created via          
 the VXT 2000 X Windowing Terminal serial communications port. The VXT          
 Software is downline loaded into a VXT 2000 or 2000+ X Windowing Ter-          
 minal from a host system utilizing BOOTP/TFTP or MOP protocols, or from        
 a InfoServer utilizing LASTport protocol.                                      
                                                                                
 The VXT Software provides local client applications that run in the            
 VXT 2000 X Terminal. Compared to host-based applications, local client         
 applications improve user response time and reduce network traffic.            
 They can also reduce host CPU loading. The following local client ap-          
 plications are included in the VXT Software: Terminal Manager, OSF/Motif       
 Window Manager, Configuration Manager, DECterm Terminal Emulator, Lo-          
 cal Application Launcher and Host Launcher. The VXT Software also sup-         
 ports an optional VXT 3270 TE local client.                                    
                                                                                
 VXT Software provides a set of fonts to support local clients. Users           
 can also access additional fonts through an X11 R5 font server using           
 TFTP, or directly from other host systems using TFTP, NFS or LAT. Fonts        
 can also be stored on an InfoServer and accessed via LASTport proto-           
 col.

 When VXT 2000 X Windowing Terminals load VXT Software from an Info-            
 Server, they can take advantage of the InfoServer's virtual memory ca-         
 pability. In this configuration, the InfoServer's disk can be used as          
 a shared memory resource among many VXT 2000 X Windowing Terminals.            
                                                                                
 VXT Software supports the X Imaging Extensions (XIE), which have been          
 submitted to the X Consortium for inclusion into the X Window System           
 standard.                                                                      
                                                                                
 Features:                                                                      
                                                                                
 Local Clients                                                                  
                                                                                
 All VXT local clients provide a menu-driven interface.                         
                                                                                
 Terminal Manager - The VXT Terminal Manager provides menus to create           
 X sessions and terminal emulation sessions to different host systems.          
 Users can customize VXT Software features such as security, font path,         
 communications and screen colors. The Autostart feature let users de-          
 termine which VXT services will start up automatically when the VXT            
 2000 X Windowing Terminal is booted. The Software Options feature lets         
 users determine which local clients and communications protocols will          
 be available. VXT Software lets users start and stop the local exe-            
 cution of any local client. These two features optimize desktop re-            
 sources in terms of performance and memory utilization.                        
                                                                                
 Window Manager - VXT Software includes a local OSF/Motif V1.1 window           
 manager. This window manager manages the placement and appearance of           
 windows and icons for local and remote applications. Users can also            
 choose to use an alternative window manager on a host system, if pre-          
 ferred. Users can customize the local window manager features through          
 a graphical user interface.                                                    
                                                                                
 Local Application Launcher - The local application launcher enables            
 users to start local clients, service connections and remote clients           
 via the local window manager. This is accomplished by supporting f.exec        
 commands in the local window manager.

    printer support and TCP/IP LPR support is provided.                         
                                                                                
 Configuration Management - Configuration management enables users to           
 customize VXT Software features for one or many VXT 2000 X Windowing           
 Terminals, from one central location. VXT Software supports three con-         
 figuration management options:                                                 
                                                                                
 o  Menu-driven, InfoServer based:                                              
                                                                                
    When VXT 2000 X Windowing Terminals are used with an InfoServer,            
    the Configuration Manager enables a system manager to customize and         
    manage work groups of terminals as well as individual terminals.            
    The customization files are stored on the InfoServer and can be copied      
    from work group to work group and terminal to terminal. Multi level         
    password protection is supported as well as the ability to backup           
    customization files. This configuration management option is sup-           
    ported in LAN environments.                                                 
                                                                                
                                  3                                             
                                                                               
                                                                                
                                                                                
 o  Menu-driven, Individual Terminal:                                           
                                                                                
    In LAN environments without an InfoServer, individual terminals can         
    be customized using the Configuration Manager. No work group op-            
    erations are supported, and password protection is on a per ter-            
    minal basis. Customization data is stored in the terminal's NVRAM           
    and can be copied from one terminal to another.                             
                                                                                
 o  Host-based configuration management:                                        
                                                                                
    VXT Software can read host-based resource files using TFTP or NFS           
    protocols. The files can include customizations for individual or           
    groups of VXT 2000 X Windowing Terminals. Host-based resource files         
    are standard X resource files that you create using a host editor           
    or X Resource editor. These resource files are stored on the host           
    system. Users have the option to apply terminal customizations from         
    a host-based resource file. In addition, access to host based .mwmrc        
    file is supported for remote customization of the local window man-         
    ager. Host based configuration management supports WAN environments.

 VXT Software supports X11 Server Release 5 (X11R5) Font Server which           
 helps users centrally manage fonts in multi-X server environments.             
                                                                                
 VXT Software can access fonts from:                                            
                                                                                
 -  X11R5 font servers using TFTP.                                              
                                                                                
 -  UNIX hosts using NFS and TFTP                                               
                                                                                
 -  OpenVMS hosts using LAT                                                     
                                                                                
 -  InfoServers using LASTport

 All fonts are accessed via a font path. Users can create font paths            
 that include multiple sources (host systems, InfoServers, and X11R5            
 font servers) and protocols. This enables users to access fonts con-           
 currently using any combination of NFS, TFTP, LASTport, LAT and TCP            
 /IP. There are 18 default memory resident fonts.                               
                                                                                
 The alias mechanism, font.alias is supported for NFS and TFTP. For LAST-       
 port, a font path is a list of services specifying LASTport font sets.         
 This use of services allows fonts paths to failover to services of-            
 fering the same name in the event of a lost connection to a service.           
                                                                                
 Font Management                                                                
                                                                                
 Each font access protocol requires the font to be in a specific for-           
 mat:                                                                           
                                                                                
 -  OpenVMS SNF for LAT                                                         
                                                                                
 -  PCF (little and big endian) for NFS and TFTP                                
                                                                                
 -  VXT fonts sets on an InfoServer for LASTport                                
                                                                                
 For NFS and TFTP hosts, a font compiler is provided to convert BDF files       
 to PCF format. In order to install the font compiler, the host sys-            
 tem must have the necessary X11 header files.                                  
                                                                                
 For LAT hosts, all fonts must be converted to OpenVMS SNF using the            
 font compiler provided with DECwindows.                                        
                                                                                
 For LASTport, users can create fonts sets on an InfoServer using the           
 VXT Font Manager. Users can create fonts sets that include PCF fonts           
 available through TFTP and OpenVMS SNF fonts through LAT. The facil-           
 ity to manage LASTport font sets is available only when VXT Software           
 is used with the InfoServer.

 Establishing X Sessions                                                        
                                                                                
 VXT Software provides several methods to create X sessions:                    
                                                                                
 -  through Create X session options in the VXT Terminal manager,               
                                                                                
 -  from the Autostart feature in the VXT Software,                             
                                                                                
 -  by directly addressing the terminal from a host originated client.          
                                                                                
 VXT Software supports X window clients accessing the terminal using            
 TCP/IP, LAT Service Class 3 and DECnet Phase IV transports. Access can         
 be restricted for each of these protocols using the Customize Secu-            
 rity feature of the VXT Software Terminal Manager. For suitably con-           
 figured hosts, the VXT allows a user to create an X session from the           
 terminal. For TCP/IP X sessions, VXT Software uses XDMCP which requires        
 XDM (X Display Manager) on the host. For LAT X sessions, a host must           
 support LAT Service Class 3. For DECnet X sessions, a DECnet object            
 must be present on the host that can display the Login box. The DEC-           
 net object is supplied for OpenVMS with the VXT host software.                 
                                                                                
 Establishing Terminal Sessions                                                 
                                                                                
 Terminal sessions can be created by using either the Create Terminal           
 Session in the VXT Terminal Manager or using the Autostart feature.            
 VXT Software provides DECterm V3.0 terminal emulation for terminal ses-        
 sions.

 VXT Software enables the VXT user to use the X Image Extensions (XIE)          
 as proposed to the X Consortium. The X Imaging Extensions are deliv-           
 ered in two modes:

 o  When the DECimage accelerator option board is installed in the VXT          
    2000, the software automatically senses its existence, thus pro-            
    viding the accelerated bitonal imaging capability.

 When VXT Software is used with an InfoServer, the VXT 2000 family of           
 windowing terminals can use a network served virtual disk as an ex-            
 tension to the physical memory of the VXT 2000 terminal. The LASTport          
 is an optimized protocol is used for paging to the networked storage           
 server.

 VXT EX (Essential X Server) Software                                           
                                                                                
 The is a server-only variant of the VXT Software that supports X11R4           
 server software. It has no local clients. The first time a user boots,         
 VXT EX will prompt the users for which systems they would like to con-         
 nect to for X sessions specifying the protocol and the single system
