     PRODUCT NAME:  DECplan Version 1.2A for VMS[*]       SPD 33.09.03

     DESCRIPTION

     DECplan  is  an  integrated  time and  project  management  tool
     designed  to  help users plan, track, schedule,  and  report  on
     projects    and    meetings.      DECplan  is  a  client/server,
     DECwindows-based tool  that  provides  a server and two clients,
     the DECplan client and the DECplan Time Manager client.  DECplan
     Time Manager is a  subset  of  the  DECplan  client.    (See SPD
     31.27.xx for details on the  DECplan  Time  Manager  client  for
     VMS.) The DECplan server manages a  single  DECplan  database of
     information  delineated  by  a  series  of planners:    project,
     personal, equipment, and locations.  Multiple DECplan or DECplan
     Time  Manager  clients  can connect to a single server.    These
     clients,  when  connected  to the DECplan server, allow users to
     share project information stored in a common database.

     Features

     Distributed and Interoperable Clients and Servers

     o  DECplan  clients  and servers of the same version can run and
        are able  to  interoperate  with  one  another  on  a  single
        hardware system or multiple systems running the VMS Operating
        System.



     ___________________
   [*] The terms VMS and  OpenVMS  refer  to  the  OpenVMS  Operating
       System.

                                  
     Planners

     o  DECplan stores all information about  a  project, a person, a
        piece of equipment, or a location  resource in a single place
        called  a  planner.    DECplan  supports single  or  multiple
        projects.  Users can create planners for each project and set
        up dependencies on other planners.  Given the right  security
        level,  users  can  access  and  review  multiple planners of
        various types  in  a  variety of DECplan views located on the
        user's local DECplan  server.    Cross-functional subprojects
        can be linked to  facilitate  enterprisewide rollups of cost,
        effort, and dates.

     o  DECplan allows views, reports,  and  scheduling  of  multiple
        planners within one server.  Cross-project  dependencies  and
        rollup activities can be performed across multiple servers.

     Views

     o  DECplan  allows users to enter and display  planner  data  in
        many user-selectable views:

        -  The Work    Breakdown  Structure  (WBS)  is  a  graphical,
           hierarchical tree structure that shows the organization of
           tasks in the project.

        -  The Precedence Network  (PN)  allows  users  to assign the
           order in which tasks  and  milestones  are to be achieved.
           The PN diagramming method supports Finish to Finish, Start
           to Start, Finish to Start, Start  to  Finish, with lag and
           overlap.  It shows critical path, and, on a color monitor,
           it can highlight the critical path in user-defined colors.
           Supernode  structures  allow  users  to collapse or expand
           user-defined collections of tasks and milestones.

        -  Both the  WBS  and  PN views have a navigation window that
           allows users to  zoom  in  and  zoom out to traverse large
           project diagrams that normally  do  not fit on one screen.
           The navigation window is also  used  to  scale  the views,
           which can then be used as the default printer output size.

        -  A  table view is a spreadsheet-like  view  of  data  in  a
           planner.  Table views can be used  to  view information on
           resources,  milestones, tasks, meetings, time charges, and
           other objects  in  a  planner.    DECplan provides default
           table views as  well  as  allows  users  the capability to
           modify and save custom table views.

        -  The Task Table is  one  type  of  table  view that shows a
           hierarchical breakdown of the work  (tasks) in spreadsheet
           form.

        -  Customized  views,  based on the standard  views,  can  be
           created and saved.  In addition, users can select any view
           to appear as a default view specific to a planner.

     o  DECplan  has an integrated Annotation Editor that allows  end
        users  to customize the  data  presented  for  each  task  or
        milestone node in the WBS and PN graphical  views.    Shading
        characteristics, the fields to display in or around the node,
        and the size of the node can all be defined by the user.

     Scheduling

     o  DECplan  provides    critical  path  scheduling,  constrained
        resources scheduling, and  shared  resources  across multiple
        projects;  uses actuals in calculations;  and allows the user
        to enter specific constraints in running schedules.

     o  The  user can ask the  scheduler  to  use  project  and  task
        priority  in  computing  schedules.   Once  tasks  have  been
        assigned and the scheduler has computed dates,  the  user can
        see scheduled tasks in the day view.

     o  Users can modify or create additional scheduling options  and
        selectively  key  on  specific  fields  to  be  used  in  the
        scheduling calculation.

     o  DECplan  scheduling also allows  replanning/rescheduling  for
        refinements and updates.

     Charts

     o  DECplan provides standard and customizable charts.

        -  The Gantt chart is a  graphic display of task duration and
           milestone occurrence in relation to time.   Information in
           the Gantt chart can be directly manipulated, and color may
           be used on appropriate monitors.  Users can  customize the
           data, select the time scale and resources, and select  the
           symbology  when  displaying  on  the  screen and in report
           output.   The Gantt chart can be used for one project or a
           series of multiple projects in the same view.

        -  DECplan also provides  Earned  Value  Charts,  Effort Rate
           Charts, Resource Loading Charts,  Cost Performance Charts,
           and Cost Variance Charts.   Users may define what style of
           chart  to  present, which project planners  to  use,  what
           colors to use, timescale, and dates to use in the charts.

     Cost Management

     o  Forecast and actual cost information can be displayed in Cost
        Charts.   In addition, a series of Earned  Value  Charts  can
        display  ACWP,  BCWS,  BCWP, schedule and cost variances, and
        estimated time to complete.

     o  DECplan supports a variety of Earned Value progress crediting
        methods:  full on start, full on finish, half-and-half, level
        of effort, and percentage variances.

     o  DECplan's cost management  follows  the  DoD/DoE CPR and CSSR
        report structure (STD 7000.10).  In addition to the graphical
        Earned Value Charts, a variety  of  tabular reports show cost
        information  and  allow  users  the flexibility  of  creating
        customized reports.

     Reports

     o  DECplan  provides  a user-defined report creation and  layout
        tool, the Report Layout Editor (RLE).  The  RLE  is  used  to
        define reports on any object stored in the database.    Users
        select items from a class of objects to place in  either  the
        report  title  page,  detail pages, or trailer pages to build
        customized reports.  The RLE provides subtotaling of columns,
        control breaks, and  other  editing features such as bolding,
        centering, underlining, and aligning  fields  using  a  grid.
        The user decides which project(s)  data to include and prints
        the report.

     o  DECplan  also  provides  approximately  30  standard  reports
        covering  all  phases  of the project management  life  cycle
        (planning, control, costs, replanning).  Each of the standard
        reports can be used to build customized reports.

     Plotter Support

     DECplan  offers plotter support for HP-GL[R]-format plotters for
     graphical and tabular output.

     Keywords, Sort, Filters

     o  DECplan  keywords    provide    users   with  a  user-defined
        alphanumeric string to  associate with tasks or other objects
        in  the database.   Keywords  can  be  used  for  a  sort  or
        filtering mechanism in views and reports.

     o  The sort feature is consistent  across  the tabular views and
        provides  ascending  or  descending  sorts,  and    sorts  in
        groupings.

     o  Filtering allows users to selectively pull any  data from the
        database for use in reports, charts, and task table views.

     o  The  user  can  also build a selection expression  filter  to
        access  and  display  data  stored  in  one  or more  project
        planners.

     Export/Import Feature

     o  DECplan  allows  users  to  import  data  using the DTIF  CDA
        interchange format.  Several CDA Extended converters exist to
        allow data transformation from  a  non-DTIF  format  to DTIF,
        which can then be imported into the DECplan database.

     o  Users  can  also  export  an entire DECplan planner  in  DTIF
        format    to   other  applications  that  accept  DTIF,  like
        DECdecision.   The  exported  planner  can also be reimported
        into DECplan across servers.

     o  DECplan exports graphical  and  tabular  views and reports in
        DDIF  format,  which  is  consistent  with  the  data  format
        accepted  by  other  DECwindows applications  like  DECwrite,
        DECwindows Mail, and DECpresent.

     DECplan Time Manager Client Features

     DECplan  Time  Manager  is a subset of DECplan.    All  features
     listed here are included with DECplan.

     Day, Month, and Year Views

     o  Users  reserve time and schedule tasks in their Time  Manager
        Day  view, which DECplan then uses to schedule and coordinate
        time across planners.

     o  A  user  can  view  the calendar in daily, monthly, or yearly
        views.

     o  The DECplan server scans  the  individual  contributor's Time
        Manager  calendar  entries  looking  for  available  time  to
        schedule task assignments.

     Meeting Scheduling, Free Time Scans

     o  Users can set up meetings with  other  DECplan  Time  Manager
        users by selecting duration of meeting, agenda, location, and
        performing a free time scan of those users' calendars to pick
        an agreeable meeting time.

     o  Users  can also use distribution lists for groups or  network
        mail  addresses  (sent  only  to  non-DECplan  users) to book
        meetings and conference rooms and send out agendas.

     o  Meetings can be repeatable in various intervals, for example,
        daily, bi-weekly, or  monthly,  or  they  can be individually
        scheduled.

     To-Do Table

     o  Time Manager users access  the task table as a means to store
        action items and to-do lists.    These  tasks can be personal
        items or tasks negotiated and delegated  as part of a task by
        the project manager using DECplan.

     o  The Time Manager users can view and manipulate their own data
        and can easily customize table rows and columns.

     Goals Tracking

     o  Users can define goals, associate a series  of tasks required
        to achieve the goal, set a priority and status for goals, and
        finally  track  the  goal  to  completion  using DECplan Time
        Manager.

     o  Users have the ability to modify goals as time progresses and
        priorities change.

     Alarms

     o  Users  can  set alarms or reminders on tasks and meetings and
        can  select  from  a range of icons to depict graphically the
        activity in their daily calendar view.

     o  Alarms are  repeatable  for successive meetings and only need
        to be set once.

     Negotiation

     o  DECplan provides for  negotiation  of  task  assignments  and
        meeting assignments between two  individuals:  the originator
        and the responder.  This  feature  enables  the originator to
        propose  assignments  to  other  users  (responders).     The
        responder  has  the  option  of  accepting or  rejecting  the
        assignment  and  providing  a  message  in  response  to  the
        proposal.  Once an assignment  is accepted,  a  copy  of  the
        original assignment is stored in the responder's planner.

     o  DECplan  also provides a  mandate  operation  for  situations
        where  negotiation  of  an assignment  is  not  desirable  or
        appropriate.

     Time Charges

     o  Users can report work completed in  their  day view or from a
        table  view  by creating a Time Charge.    Time  Charges  are
        rolled up into the expended effort of a  task,  thus  showing
        progress  made  against  that  task.  The individual updating
        status in  this  manner,  using  Time  Manager, automatically
        updates the DECplan project management views.

     Help and Online Training

     o  In  addition  to    the   above  features,  DECplan  provides
        context-sensitive  online  Help  to  provide  users  with  an
        understanding of how to use DECplan and Time Manager.

     o  DECplan  also  provides modular, Bookreader-delivered  online
        training  to  complement  the  context-sensitive Help.    The
        training  modules  include  a  set of training  planners  and
        exercises.

     These counts refer  to  the  disk  space  required on the system
     disk.   The sizes  are  approximate;    actual  sizes  may  vary
     depending on the user's system  environment,  configuration, and
     software options.  Database verification is  available only when
     installing the DECplan server.


     Memory Requirements for DECwindows Support:

     The performance and memory usage of DECwindows  applications are
     particularly sensitive to system configuration.  Less memory may
     be  required  on the DECwindows client system (the system  where
     the software is installed and executed) if the DECwindows server
     (the component that displays the application) resides on another
     system.  More  memory  may  be required on a system with several
     applications  running  or  may   be  desirable  to  improve  the
     performance of an application.

     DECplan displays on all PCs  supported by PATHWORKS for VMS.  In
     order to operate the DECplan or  DECplan Time Manager DECwindows
