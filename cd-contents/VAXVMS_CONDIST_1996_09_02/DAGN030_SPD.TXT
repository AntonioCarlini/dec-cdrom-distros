PRODUCT NAME:  Digital Application Generator Version 3.0   SPD 56.32.01
               VB Development for Windows

DESCRIPTION

Summary

The Digital Application Generator, formerly known as DECADMIRE[TM],
is an application development environment that generates high-performance
commercial applications. Rapid application development methodologies
(prototyping, code templates, screen and code generation) are used to
build reliable, production applications. The Application Generator is
developed and licensed to Digital, by Mirus Data AB, Sweden.

Digital Application Generator gives application developers access to
a rich development environment based on the Windows NT[TM] or Windows
95[R] operating system. In this environment, developers can create large-
scale, portable, Visual Basic client/server applications for a range
of computing platforms. By extending the easy-to-use features of Mi-
crosoft[R] Visual Basic[R] (VB), the Application Generator allows de-
velopers in large workgroups and enterprise-wide development environ-
ments to design, define, prototype, generate, and test two-tier and
three-tier client/server and Transaction Processing (TP) applications
cost-effectively and efficiently.

Product Overview

Below are some of the key features of this release.

                                                          July 1996

Rapid Application Development

The Application Generator provides a comprehensive Rapid Application
Development (RAD) framework designed specifically to offer a devel-
opment environment capable of building VB client/server applications
that manage business-critical data. In addition to prototyping two-
tier (ODBC) applications, the Application Generator automatically builds
Business Objects as remote OLE servers for three-tier VB4 client/server
applications. The Application Generator also builds three-tier TP ap-
plications with Digital's ACMSxp or ACMS TP software for the highest
performance business solution.

Partitioned Applications

The generated applications support a three-tiered logical application
architecture, and deploy flexibly through encapsulated, shared and reusable
components. This Logical Services Model, where a service is a collec-
tion of selected features that respond to requests for specific ac-
tivities, will automatically partition your application into User Ser-
vices, Business Services and Data Services. Partitioned applications
gives you a number of advantages, enhancing the application's reusabil-
ity, flexibility, manageability and maintainability.

OLE Automation Servers

The Application Generator creates OLE Automation Servers with remote
automation capabilities. These business objects:

o  Can provide consistent implementation of widely used business rules.

o  Are available for users of tools that support OLE Automation, such
   as Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Project.

Component Details

There are five major components of the Application Generator frame-
work:

1. Builder

The Builder provides a framework for application prototyping. This frame-
work includes forms, icons, and modifiable code templates. In conjunc-
tion with Microsoft Visual Basic, this environment allows you to de-
fine and prototype your application. One or many projects can be set
up to complete development.

The Builder allows the application developer to interactively deter-
mine the application structure, and the appearance of the forms as-
sociated with the application. This logical application definition is
stored in a shared database regardless of the type of application to
be generated. The developer may choose from several database options
depending on the operating system.

The developer can also simulate how the application works, including
database operations against the server without having to generate all
of the executable code. Visual Basic is utilized to prototype the ap-
plication in a Windows environment.

2. Utilities

The utilities assist with the creation and setup of your Application
Generator environment, and with the import or creation of your Appli-
cation Generator design database, including the creation of the dataset,
definition of developers who are authorized to use the environment,
application messages, and reserved words.

Existing data definitions can be imported or cloned into the Appli-
cation Generator to be used as an application design base, and can be
exported for transfer to a new design base on a new platform.

3. Online Information System

The online information system provides a tutorial for the Application
Generator, HELP, online manuals, and Job Aids to help you learn and
complete the application development process.

                                 3

 

The Tutorial provides practice on application development tasks.

Help provides comprehensive information about the options, menus, and
screens in the development environment.

Online documentation may be easily browsed on screen while working with
the tool, and may be printed if desired.

The Job Aids provide step-by-step instructions to perform specific tasks
in the Application Generator. Job aids can be printed out for easy ref-
erence.

4. VB Generator

The generator allows you to generate Visual Basic, ODBC, and OLE code
for complete client/server solutions using VB applications and an ODBC
database connection. Once your code is designed, the VB Generator will
allow you generate, test, and customize the code.

The generator creates the application code for the appropriate plat-
form and environment paradigms that you choose. The VB form, basic code,
and the make files are generated before prototyping is completed us-
ing Visual Basic. The same generator process is utilized to generate
all variations of applications.

The source code for the application is produced by the generator. This
code can be modified enabling additional features or customizations
to be added to the application. The code contains markers which de-
limit portions of the code that will be updated during regeneration
from changes made in the builder. Code modifications placed outside
of these markers are not changed. The latest version of the source code
can be used for regeneration, capturing all customizations.

5. TP Generators

One of the features of the Digital Application Generator is that de-
velopers may scale the application for a large number of users by gen-
erating their design as a transaction processing application.


                                 4

 

To give our customers the most flexibility, released the PC-based de-
velopment kit as a self-contained environment. The transaction pro-
cessing generation kits are available as "add-on" features to the prod-
uct. These add-on options enable developers to choose only the deploy-
ment features that they require.

There are three TP generators now available as add-on options to the
product:

   o  ACMSxp server for Windows NT

   o  ACMSxp server for OpenVMS

   o  ACMS server for OpenVMS

When you create a new Project in the Application Generator, you can
select either ODBC or Transaction Processing for deployment. You should
select only ODBC at this time. Although the Transaction Processing op-
tion is active, it will not function properly without an "add-on" gen-
erator for TP.

Middleware Options For Deployment

ODBC

o  Provides database independent data access interface.

o  Minimizes network traffic with the use of Extended Fetch

o  Executes faster with prepared execution of statements

OLE

o  Provides interaction with other OLE-compliant applications.

o  Data validation on OLE Server reduces network traffic




                                 5

 

ACMSxp

o  Provides portable, standards-based Transaction Processing

o  Minimizes network traffic with the use of optimized ASCII workspaces

o  Transaction handling is possible in a separate software tier

o  Data access through embedded SQL in compiled 3GL procedures

ACMS

o  Traditional OpenVMS-based Transaction Processing environment pro-
   vides investment protection for legacy sites

o  PC-based GUI may be incorporated into new applications

o  Data access through embedded SQL in compiled 3GL procedures

Development Environment Highlights

o  Repository-Driven RAD Framework

A repository holds information and business rules for the Business and
Data Services, as well as user interface and appearance issues for the
User Services. This environment-independent information is stored in
an ODBC-compliant Design Database and is used when building your ap-
plication.

o  Application Objects

Application Objects are high-level software building blocks, contain-
ing both User Services and Business Services with built-in business
logic and a rich set of predefined functionality. An instance of an
Application Object is called a Design Module and a working applica-
tion consists of a collection of Design Modules connected together to
provide the required functionality. The Design Modules are automat-
ically separated into OLE clients and OLE servers.

o  Multi-user Development Support

                                 6

 

By adopting the VB project style, enhanced with Application Objects,
the Project Leader can easily have several people working with dif-
ferent parts of a large project. All Design Modules are stored in the
common repository and, therefore, are available to everyone, even if
they are working with a subset of the overall project. Developer pref-
erences can be customized to provide tool tips, one, two, or zero tool
bars, a menu bar, colors, and default startup configurations.

o  Code Generator

All necessary VB code, such as forms, class modules and standard mod-
ules are automatically generated based on your design.

o  Template-driven Application Design

The scope and extent of the built-in functionality in the Application
Objects is defined in templates. A predefined template project serves
as the foundation for every Design Module in your application that is
used by the code generator. If you alter the Template Project to suit
your needs regarding functionality and look and feel, the Application
Objects will automatically inherit these alterations and all created
Design Modules will function and appear as defined in the Template Project.

The templates supplied by Digital are subject to change in order to
accommodate enhancements to the product and new features. The devel-
oper is responsible for merging their custom template changes into fu-
ture templates supplied by Digital.

o  Import Database Facilities

The developer can import the database structure from an existing ODBC-
compliant database into the Design Database, automatically populat-
ing the repository with Data Services information. In addition, the
Copy Database facility enables you to copy a complete Design Database
from one physical ODBC-compliant database to another, such as from MS
Access to MS SQL[TM] Server.

o  Generate Native SQL Scripts


                                 7

 

The Data Services information stored in the Repository can be gener-
ated into native SQL script files for a number of different target databases.


Deployment Environment Highlights


o  Partitioned Applications

By using the three-tiered logical application architecture, your ap-
plication is software partitioned into User Services, Business Ser-
vices and Data Services. You have multiple deployment options regard-
ing physical hardware considerations, such as In Process OLE Servers,
Out of Process OLE servers, and Remote OLE servers.

o  Middleware Independence

Visual Basic based applications can be generated using ODBC or OLE.
The VB form and logic remains the same regardless of the middleware
or type of application selected.

The interface for the generated business objects is completely inde-
pendent of the actual middleware used for communicating with the data
source. A user of the business object is unaware of what mechanism is
used when requesting database services.

o  Dictionary Object

The Dictionary Object is a software partition containing business in-
formation needed both on the client and the server. The main reasons
for creating a separate partition are improved consistency, perfor-
mance and maintenance. The dictionary object contains information about
tables and columns in the repository and will normally result in an
In Process OLE server (.DLL file). The dictionary object will be ref-
erenced for generic requests, relevant for both clients and servers
such as field-level validations.

o  High Performance

The generated application is extensively addressing performance is-
sues. For example:

                                 8

 

o  OLE servers

Usage of early binding. Requiring minimal amount of calls to the OLE
server, using techniques such as passing parameters.

o  ODBC

Implementation of the ODBC API for best server resource usage and re-
mote database access performance. Minimizing network traffic with the
use of SQLExtendedFetch. Usage of prepared execution of statements.

o  Built-in VB Features

Your application will benefit from a rich set of built-in Visual Ba-
sic features without requiring extensive manual coding:

   o  MDI Environment Support.

   o  Predefined Menus, Popup Menus, ToolBar and StatusBar.

   o  Support for Tabs (TabStrip Control).

   o  Drag and Drop Support.

   o  Field-level Validations Support.

   o  Built-In Event Handling (record browsing, editing and database
      actions and so on).

   o  Support for multiple instances of forms.

   o  Support for connections between Design Modules.

   o  Advanced error handling, trapping all errors and displaying the
      call tree.

   o  Utilization of VB4 language enhancements, such as Collections,
      Property Procedures, With...End With and For Each...Next.

   o  Separation of form and function.
