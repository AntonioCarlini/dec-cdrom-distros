 PRODUCT NAME:  DECndu (Network Device Upgrade) Utility SPD 33.47.02
                for VMS, Version 1.2

 DESCRIPTION

 DECndu (Network Device Upgrade) Utility allows users, at a host in an
 "Extended LAN," to upgrade the existing version of software within the
 DECbridge 500, DECconcentrator 500, and the DEC FDDIcontroller 400.

 DECbridge 500, DECconcentrator 500 and DEC FDDIcontroller are FDDI prod-
 ucts which ship from the factory with the software preloaded. The soft-
 ware resides in electrically alterable memory within the hardware and
 is updated via the DECndu Utility.

 DECndu upgrades the existing version of software in the DEC FDDIcon-
 troller 400 via the local backplane.

 DECndu upgrades the existing version of software in the DECbridge 500,
 and DECconcentrator 500 via the "Extended LAN." An "Extended LAN" is
 a collection of LANs (Local Area Networks) that are interconnected and
 logically appear as one large Local Area Network.

 General characteristics of the DECndu Utility for VMS:

 o  Installs and resides on the host in the LAN

 o  Loads the new device software from the host into electrically al-
    terable memory within the hardware device, where it will remain

 o  Verifies that the load was successful
