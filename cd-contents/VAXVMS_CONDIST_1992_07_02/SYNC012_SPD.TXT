 Hardware Devices

                               DIGITAL                  January 1992

                                                         AE-LM60D-TE

 

 o  The DST32 (single line sync) and DSH32 (dual line sync) are multi-
    function devices for busless MicroVAX systems. The communications
    controllers support DMA transfers for bit oriented protocols and
    perform character transmission, reception, and framing in microcode.

 o  The DSW21 and DSW41 (single line) and DSW42 (dual line) are high
    performance synchronous communications controllers for busless Mi-
    croVAX 3100 and VAXstation 4000 systems. The communications con-
    trollers support DMA transfers for bit oriented protocols and per-
    form character transmission, reception, and framing in microcode.

 o  The DMV11 (Q-bus) is a single line communications controller for
    Q-bus systems. The DMV11 implements DDCMP in firmware and supports
    DMA data transfers and DDCMP point-to-point configurations. The DMV11
    can support up to 12 tributaries depending on the operating sys-
    tem and layered software.

 o  The DPV11-DA or DPV11-S (Q-bus) and DUP11 (UNIBUS) are character
    interrupt devices for datalink handling. CPU cycles are required
    for data link-level protocol processing and for each character sent
    and received.

 o  The DSV11 (Q-bus) is a high performance dual line synchronous com-
    munications device for Q-bus systems. The DSV11 supports DMA trans-
    fers for bit and character oriented protocols. The communications
    controller performs character transmission, reception, and fram-
    ing in microcode.

 o  The KMV1A-A or KMV1A-SF (Q-bus) communications controller executes
    transmission, reception, and X.25 LAPB link-level protocol process-
    ing in microcode. Optional link-level software products, drivers,
    and tools are available for the KMV1A device if required. The KMV1A
    device was previously known as the KMV11-A.

 o  The DSF32 (MI-bus) is a multi-function device for VAXft fault tol-
    erant systems. The DSF32 provides a dual line synchronous capabil-
    ity and supports DMA transfers for bit and character oriented pro-
    tocols. The communications controller performs character transmis-
    sion, reception, and framing in microcode. The two lines can be used
    independently to run different protocols or can be used to provide

                                  2

 

    a failover capability between lines in the event of an application
    or system failure.

 o  The DMB32 (BI-bus) and DMF32 (UNIBUS) are multi-function devices
    that include a single DMA line. The communications controllers per-
    form character transmission, reception, and framing in microcode.

    For the DMB32, revision J is required for applications using HDLC,
    SDLC, and GENBYTE protocols. In the case of the DMF32, only revi-
    sion J and later are supported for use with the HDLC protocol, and
    revision M is required for simultaneous operation of the printer
    port.

 o  The DSB32 (BI-bus) is a high performance dual line synchronous com-
    munications device for VAXBI systems. The DSB32 supports DMA trans-
    fers for bit and character oriented protocols. The communications
    controller performs character transmission, reception, and fram-
    ing in microcode.

 o  The DMC11 and DMR11 (UNIBUS) are single line communications con-
    trollers that provide local or remote connections between UNIBUS
    systems. The DMC11 and DMR11 implement DDCMP in firmware and sup-
    port DMA data transfers and DDCMP point-to-point configurations.

 o  The KMS1P-A, KMS1P-B, and KMS11-B (UNIBUS) products are DMA devices.
    The KMS communications controller executes character transmission,
    reception, and X.25 data link-level protocol processing in microcode
    (LAPB only, for packets not larger than 1024 bytes). The VAX CPU
    then processes the X.25 packet level protocol. Optional link-level
    software products and tools available for the KMS devices are not
    required. The KMS1P-A and KMS1P-B were previously known as the KMS11-
    PX and KMS11-PY.

 Notes:

 o  The use of UNIBUS options on a VAXBI system with a UNIBUS Adapter
    is not supported unless specified in Table 2 of this Software Prod-
    uct Description.

 o  The DMB32, DMF32, and DSH32 are multi-function devices. Only the
    Device Driver for the synchronous ports are included in the VAX WAN
    Device Drivers.

 o  The DMB32 must be revision J or later for applications using GEN-
    BYTE, HDLC, or SDLC protocols.

 o  The DMF32 must be revision J or later for applications using HDLC
    protocol.

 VAX WAN Device Drivers includes Device Drivers that are reserved for
 use by Digital software products as well as Device Drivers that of-
 fer a supported user ($QIO) interface. Table 1 of the System Support
 Addendum (SSA 29.64.03-x) lists the Device Driver characteristics. The
 table entries indicate the maximum permitted line speeds in kilobits
 /second for each of the protocols supported by the individual drivers.

 The Device Drivers all support full duplex and half duplex operation,
 where appropriate to the protocol. DDCMP and SDLC Device Drivers sup-
 port both point-to-point and multipoint tributary operation. The IBM[R]
 implementation of the bisynchronous protocol is supported by some of
 the Device Drivers. The GENBYTE protocol, a general byte-oriented pro-
 tocol for use with user-written framing routines, is supported by the
 DMB32 and DMF32 Device Drivers.

 The maximum permitted line speed depends on the line interface stan-
 dard used and should not exceed the specification of the appropriate
 standard. Refer to the product descriptions for the appropriate syn-
 chronous interfaces for more information about the line speeds sup-
 ported by an individual device.

 Note: Digital communications layered products may not support opera-
 tion of the synchronous interface at the maximum speed supported by
 the Device Driver. Refer to the appropriate Software Product Descrip-
 tion for the Digital communications product for precise details of sup-
 ported configurations.

 In all cases, the data throughput over the synchronous lines is de-
 pendent on the user applications and system environment.

 The device drivers all support modem control signal operation. Refer
 to the product descriptions for the appropriate synchronous interface
 for details of the modem signals supported by an individual device.
