           PRODUCT NAME:  MicroVAX/DRQ3B Device Driver, Version 1.3B
           SPD 29.25.04

           DESCRIPTION

           The MicroVAX/DRQ3B Device Driver V1.3B (HXDRIVER) supports
           the DRQ3B interface, which is a general purpose 16 bit par-
           allel interface between the MicroVAX Q-bus and a user's pe-
           ripheral. The DRQ3B, under driver control, is capable of per-
           forming double buffered direct memory access (DMA) using the
           block mode capabilities of the Q-bus to provide high band-
           width data transfers. The DRQ3B interface also has 512 word
           FIFO (First In, First Out) buffers on both the input and out-
           put ports to allow data to be transferred while an inter-
           rupt service routine is setting up the next buffer.

           Driver Features

           o  Double buffering of I/O requests

           o  Buffer termination via an external event (EOP)

           o  External interrupt

           o  Function bit setting/clearing

           o  DMA operations directly to Q-bus memory

           o  Error handling

           Double Buffering of I/O Requests

           As long as two or more buffers are queued to the driver, it
           will automatically try to double buffer the I/O requests.
           A function modifier IO$M_HX_HOLD_DMA allows an application
           to queue up multiple buffers before starting I/O, so all of
           the queued buffers can be double buffered.

           Buffer Termination Via an External Event (EOP)

           The hardware has a line on the input connector that is han-
           dled like a 17th data bit but will cause a DMA operation to
           terminate and a new one to start when asserted and read out
           of the FIFO by the DMA controller. The driver supports this
           condition and returns the number of words transferred in-
           cluding the last one transferred with the external event as-
           serted, as well as the success code SS$_WASSET rather than
           the conventional SS$_NORMAL. This enables an application to
           test for the occurrence of this condition.

           External Interrupt

           A line separate from the external event line allows an in-
           terrupt to be generated. The driver allows the detection of
           this condition in an AST routine.

           Function Bit Setting/Clearing

           The driver provides SETMODE functions that will set/clear
           the function bits for a given port, and allows the function
           bits to be read with a SENSEMODE function.

           DMA Operations Directly to Q-bus Memory

           The driver supports two forms of I/O, logical and physical.

           o  Physical I/O transfers allow the transfer of data directly
              to Q-bus memory and specialized I/O subsystems such as
              those found in some types of array processors.

           o  The driver also allows MicroVAX memory to be used for phys-
              ical I/O transfers to reduce overhead.

           o  Logical I/O supports the more traditional mechanisms for
              performing DMA. As a result, it is easier to program but
              is a little less efficient.

           The driver will report nonexistent memory conditions (NXMs),
           FIFO overruns, and FIFO underruns in case the interface logic
           stops handshaking correctly.

           The DRQ3B MicroVAX Device Driver can support up to four DRQ3B
           Interfaces.
