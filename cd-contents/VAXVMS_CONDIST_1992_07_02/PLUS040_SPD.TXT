           PRODUCT NAME:  VAX DECalc-PLUS, Version 4.0  SPD 27.37.04

           DESCRIPTION

           VAX DECalc-PLUS is a multi-user spreadsheet designed specif-
           ically for technical, engineering and scientific environ-
           ments. VAX DECalc-PLUS combines an interactive, easy-to-use
           spreadsheet with the ability to call external routines writ-
           ten in any programming language that supports the VMS call-
           ing standard. From within a VAX DECalc-PLUS session, the user
           can link in one or more external routines and use the spread-
           sheet grid boxes to hold parameters to be passed as inputs
           to the routine, or to receive output from the routine. In
           addition, users can specify that a routine be iteratively
           executed for a specified number of times. VAX DECalc-PLUS
           executes in native mode under the VMS Operating System and
           drives a VT100, VT200 or VT300 series terminal. VAX DECalc-PLUS
           is easy to learn and requires little computer experience.

           The VAX DECalc-PLUS spreadsheet enables users to perform com-
           mon mathematical, statistical, and financial analyses via
           builtin functions, including, but not limited to: cosine,
           tangent, sine, logarithms; average, minimum and maximum value,
           least squares, standard deviation; payment, payback, depre-
           ciation, and discounts. The VAX DECalc-PLUS spreadsheet also
           enables users to manipulate their data via DELETE, INSERT,
           MOVE and REPRODUCE commands. The spreadsheet contains an ex-
           tensive set of date manipulation functions and formatting
           capabilities. Refer to the VAX DECalc Software Product De-
           scription (SPD 25.79.xx) for a more comprehensive descrip-
           tion of the spreadsheet functionality.

           VAX DECalc-PLUS, Version 4.0                SPD 27.37.04


           VAX DECalc-PLUS contains an extensive set of subroutines that
           can be linked to and perform many common mathematical and
           statistical analyses used in technical and engineering en-
           vironments. Forms which prompt the user for the location of
           the arguments in the spreadsheet to be passed to and received
           from these routines are also provided.

           The routines can be categorized in the following manner:

           o  Parametric and Nonparametric Statistical Analyses includ-
              ing T test (paired and unpaired), one- and two-way ANOVA,
              multiple linear regression, Kendall Rank correlation test,
              Spearman Rank correlation test, and Mann-Whitney U-test.

           o  Matrix mathematics including scalar multiplication, di-
              vision, addition and subtraction, matrix inversion and
              transposition, solution of linear equations, Eigenval-
              ues and vectors of a symmetric matrix.

           o  Numerical analyses including numeric integration, zeroes
              of polynomials, solutions for differential equations, and
              Fast Fourier transforms.

           o  Linear and non-linear curve fitting.

           o  Regression analysis and simulation.
              VAX DECalc-PLUS allows the user to create an interface
              called a template, so existing routines can be used with
              VAX DECalc-PLUS. VAX DECalc-PLUS also includes the ca-
              pability for users to specify how VAX DECalc-PLUS will
              access external subroutines.

              Users can:

           o  Specify the name of the routine, the file name and lo-
              cation where it resides on the system and give a brief
              description of the routine's functionality.

           o  Specify the text strings to be used to prompt for input
              and output arguments when the routine is executed from
              within VAX DECalc-PLUS.

           VAX DECalc-PLUS, Version 4.0                SPD 27.37.04


           o  Indicate whether an argument is an input or output for
              the routine, and if it is an integer, real or text data
              type.

           o  Specify particular box locations in the VAX DECalc-
              PLUS grid as default responses for the prompts. This fa-
              cilitates setting up forms for executing the subroutines
              that can be used by less experienced users.

              VAX DECalc-PLUS allows users to access and execute ex-
              ternal routines by means of the APPLICATION LINK command.
              With this command, users can:

           o  Include in the VAX DECalc-PLUS image the subroutines to
              execute. These routines can be the ones provided with the
              VAX DECalc-PLUS product (whose forms have already been
              provided), or other routines whose prompting forms have
              been previously set up. These routines can be either user-
              written or provided by a standard, commercially avail-
              able subroutine package.

           o  Obtain a listing of the routines that have been included
              (loaded) into the VAX DECalc-PLUS image. This listing shows
              the routine name, file location and a brief description
              of each.

           o  Define the box locations on the grid for the input and
              output parameters. Users can specify these locations by
              means of a special dimensional reference shorthand, which
              allows the completed form to be used for many different
              grids.

           o  Save already defined routine forms in a VMS file to be
              used again.

           o  Execute subroutines from within the VAX DECalc-
              PLUS session using the parameters specified in the rou-
              tine's form. The contents of the grid boxes specified as
              inputs are passed to the routine and the outputs from the


                                       3

 



           VAX DECalc-PLUS, Version 4.0                SPD 27.37.04


              routine are placed in output grid box parameters. Rou-
              tines can be re-executed quickly by means of a single key
              on the VT200 or VT300 series keyboard.

           o  Execute subroutines with a number-of-iterations control.
              This enables users to try more than one ``what if'' sce-
              nario at a time.

              By using the VAX DECalc-PLUS spreadsheet for data entry,
              manipulation and formatting, users can perform ``what if''
              analyses easily with sophisticated subroutines, and dis-
              play the results in a variety of formats.

           Integration with other VMS applications:

           o  VAX DECalc-PLUS can also be used with VAX DECgraph. Spread-
              sheet data is loaded from VAX DECalc-PLUS into VAX DEC-
              graph to be manipulated and plotted as desired.

           o  VAX DECalc-PLUS can be used with VAX
              DATATRIEVE. VAX DECalc-PLUS utilizes VAX
              DATATRIEVE's callable interface to enable users to re-
              trieve information from VAX DATATRIEVE for use in VAX DECalc-PLUS
              and to use VAX DATATRIEVE interactively.

           o  From within VAX DECalc-PLUS users can access:

              -  A mail utility of their choice

              -  An editor of their choice

              -  The VMS DIRECTORY command to view the directory of their
                 choice

              -  VMS DCL (may be disabled if desired)

              -  SPAWN/ATTACH

                 -  The SPAWN option allows the user to begin a sub-
                    process without leaving the current DECalc-PLUS ses-
                    sion.

                    subprocess without leaving the current DECalc-PLUS
                    session.
