           DESCRIPTION

           DECnet/SNA Gateway for Channel Transport (DECnet/SNA Gateway-
           CT) is a member of the DECnet/SNA Transport product family.
           This family consists of hardware and software products that
           allow users to exchange information and share resources be-
           tween suitably configured Digital systems in a DECnet en-
           vironment and IBM® systems in a Systems Network Architec-
           ture (SNA) environment. Users on one or more Digital sys-
           tems can simultaneously perform functions such as access-
           ing IBM application programs or other system resources, act
           as a 3270 display station, perform data transfer between Dig-
           ital and IBM file systems, exchange electronic documents and
           mail messages, submit jobs to IBM batch subsystems acting
           as a Remote Job Entry workstation, and implement distributed,
           task-to-task application programs that run between Digital
           and IBM systems.

           The DECnet/SNA Transport product set provides a means of con-
           necting DECnet and SNA networks which can be used by a wide
           variety of Digital-supplied access routines running under
           VMS, MS-DOS®, and ULTRIX operating environments. The DEC-
           net/SNA Gateway-CT is managed and configured using the DEC-
           net/SNA management software that is part of the DECnet/SNA
           Gateway-CT product. For additional information on the var-
           ious access routines and their capabilities, please consult
           the OPTIONAL SOFTWARE section of the System Support Adden-
           dum (SSA 29.76.02-x).

           DECnet/SNA Gateway for Channel              SPD 29.76.02
           Transport, Version 2.1

           DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT is part of both the DECnet and the SNA
           networks. Architecturally, it is a DECnet Phase IV end node
           to DECnet and a Physical Unit Type 2.0 node to SNA. It pro-
           vides bi-directional access between DECnet and SNA networks.

           The DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT software is supported on two hard-
           ware platforms - the DEC ChannelServer (DESNA-Ax) and DEC
           ChannelServer II (DESNB-Ax). Both systems connect directly
           to an Ethernet Local Area Network and an IBM S/370 Byte Mul-
           tiplexor, Block Multiplexor, or Selector channel. When used
           with DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT, they provide SNA connectivity
           to any Phase IV [or Phase IV+] DECnet system in the DECnet
           network. This product can be used in networks currently us-
           ing other DECnet/SNA Gateway systems and can share access
           routines, Ethernet LANs, and load host resources with those
           systems.

           DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT software is down-line loaded into the
           DEC ChannelServer or DEC ChannelServer II system and must
           be ordered in addition to the DEC ChannelServer hardware.
           Other DECnet systems wishing access to the SNA environment
           through the DEC ChannelServer or DEC ChannelServer II, should
           be configured with the appropriate DECnet/SNA access rou-
           tine(s).

           DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT and the DEC ChannelServer/DEC Chan-
           nelServer II support a single set of Bus and Tag connectors
           to an IBM S/370 Byte Multiplexor, Block Multiplexor, or Se-
           lector channel. Channel type and address may be configured
           according to specifications listed in both the hardware and
           the software user documentation.

           Loading DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT Software

           The DEC ChannelServer/DEC ChannelServer II requires soft-
           ware to be loaded into memory prior to DECnet/SNA Gateway
           operation. DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT software is down-line loaded
           into the hardware over the Ethernet Local Area Network from
           a VMS or ULTRIX system acting as DECnet load host system.

           DECnet/SNA Gateway for Channel              SPD 29.76.02
           Transport, Version 2.1

           Most VAX, MicroVAX, VAXstation, DECsystem, and DECstation
           systems running VMS or ULTRIX are supported as Ethernet load
           hosts for DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT. Supported VMS and ULTRIX
           configurations are described in the System Support Adden-
           dum (SSA 29.76.02-x).

           DECnet/SNA Gateway Management

           DECnet/SNA gateway management software, which is part of the
           DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT, provides configuration and manage-
           ment functions for use with DECnet/SNA Gateway for Channel
           Transport V2.1. This management software allows the Gate-
           way administrator to configure the software executing in the
           DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT system. The administrator can set up
           parameters relating to lines, circuits, physical units, log-
           ical units, and other key variables necessary for network-
           to-network communications between the DECnet and SNA net-
           works. Additionally, the gateway management software allows
           the administrator to manage and diagnose problems related
           to the DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT.

           DECnet/SNA gateway management software is required on the
           Digital load host node for DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT. It must
           also be present on any other VMS or ULTRIX node where users
           want to manage a DEC ChannelServer/DEC ChannelServer II (DEC-
           net/SNA Gateway-CT) based Gateway. It is strongly recommended
           that the software also be installed on VMS or ULTRIX sys-
           tems in order to facilitate debugging functions where IBM
           Interconnect application programs are developed using any
           of the DECnet/SNA Programming Interface products.

           Gateway management software includes DECnet-style network
           management tools for configuring, controlling, monitoring,
           and troubleshooting for DECnet/SNA Gateway itself. These ac-
           tivities are generally performed by the Digital system man-
           ager responsible for the designated load host node. Most man-
           agement functions are performed from a node on the Digital
           network rather than at or on the Gateway itself.

           DECnet/SNA Gateway for Channel              SPD 29.76.02
           Transport, Version 2.1

           Management of the DECnet/SNA Gateway should be viewed as part
           of the Digital environment, while the management of the lines
           and/or channel connecting the DECnet/SNA Gateway to the IBM
           system is a joint responsibility of the IBM and Digital sys-
           tem managers. (Refer to the Customer Responsibilities sec-
           tion of this Software Product Description.)

           DECnet/SNA gateway management software allows a Digital sys-
           tem operator to bootstrap or restart a DECnet/SNA Gateway
           remotely and provide configuration and initialization fa-
           cilities for the DECnet/SNA Gateway.

           Problem Isolation and Determination Tools for the Gateway

           In addition to event logging and error counters, a wide range
           of fault isolation tools are included.

           Trace capabilities, snatrace for ULTRIX and SNATRACE and NET-
           TRACE for VMS, are provided with the DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT
           to help debug application programs as well as assist in iden-
           tifying system problems. An operator can run a trace at the
           Circuit, Physical Unit (PU), or Session level, and then for-
           mat the data on a specified Digital system. The trace fea-
           tures are helpful in identifying an error for remedial ac-
           tion.

           A snapshot monitoring utility is provided to display on a
           Digital host-controlled terminal the status of the Gateway's
           buffer availability, the number of SNA sessions currently
           in progress, and other information that pertains to both the
           DECnet and SNA network.

           If an irrecoverable error should occur during operation of
           the DECnet/SNA Gateway system, a memory image may be dumped
           to a designated Ethernet attached VAX or RISC host. This mem-
           ory image may then be provided to your Digital support per-
           sonnel for problem diagnosis.
