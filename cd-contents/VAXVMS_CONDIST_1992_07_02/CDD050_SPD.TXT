           PRODUCT NAME:  CDD/Repository for VMS,       SPD 25.53.20
                          Version 5.0 

           DESCRIPTION

           CDD/Repository for VMS is an active, distributed repository
           system that provides the capabilities for users to organize,
           manage, control and integrate tools and applications across
           the entire enterprise. CDD/Repository is the foundation of
           Digital Equipment Corporation's COHESION Environment and a
           component of Network Application Support (NAS). It is an evo-
           lutionary outgrowth of the earlier CDD/Plus data dictionary
           and is now able to provide the data integration capabili-
           ties required in software development environments.

           The repository simplifies application development by pro-
           viding both information management and environment manage-
           ment features.

           Information Management Features

           Common View of Information

           CDD/Repository for VMS provides a storage area for common
           elements and methods that can be accessed and shared by mul-
           tiple applications. Use (and re-use) of common elements saves
           development time.

           Consistency of Information

           When multiple applications use the same elements and meth-
           ods, redundant information and conflicting definitions can
           be eliminated. CDD/Repository includes a notification sys-
           tem that alerts users to changes made to related elements.

           Users can also check the effects of a projected change be-
           fore the change is made.

           Distribution of Information

           CDD/Repository for VMS is designed to allow customers to treat
           multiple physical repositories as one logical repository span-
           ning multiple devices in a network. Users can transparently
           access repositories on different devices on a single node,
           on different nodes in a VAXcluster, or on different nodes
           on a local or wide area network within the performance char-
           acteristics of the network and remote nodes. Repositories
           can be organized according to the needs of a corporation and
           definitions can either be managed centrally or locally. Users
           can switch from one physical repository to another and gain
           access to definitions in any of the repositories the user
           can access.

           Extensible Information Model

           The CDD/Repository Information Model contains a base set of
           elements, behaviors, and relationships that span all phases
           of the software development process. This allows users to
           model, manipulate, and control aspects of product and pro-
           cess as development occurs.

           The Information Model is implemented in the form of an object-
           oriented type hierarchy. This form is designed to reduce the
           amount of information that must be explicitly stated in ap-
           plication code.

           The CDD/Repository Information Model can be extended to cre-
           ate additional elements, behaviors, and relationships. This
           functionality allows users to customize (extend) the infor-
           mation model to integrate applications and tools, or to ad-
           dress business-specific needs.

           Environment Management Features

           Configuration Management

           Configuration management is tailored to the needs of groups
           working on complex development efforts. It provides for mul-
           tiple versions of system elements, multiple versions of sys-
           tem configurations, and variant lines of development.

           Context Management

           Context management allows users to switch between activi-
           ties equated to project tasks, and to maintain the current
           state of each activity.

           User-Designed Approval Structures

           These structures allow users to promote system elements to
           higher levels (and wider visibility) as they become more sta-
           ble or meet specified criteria.

           Version Management

           This capability allows users to track versions of work prod-
           ucts and to manage the concurrent creation of new versions
           by multiple users. Multiple variants of an object can be cre-
           ated and merged back together into a single version.

           Pieces Tracking and Notification

           Pieces Tracking makes it possible to locate all uses of a
           shared definition. This facilitates impact analysis and plan-
           ning for the implementation of changes.

           The notification mechanism delivers a notice that a defi-
           nition has been changed to any user or application that ac-
           cesses a copy of the definition.

           CDD/Repository for VMS, Version 5.0         SPD 25.53.20


           CDD/Repository for VMS provides the capability to grant or
           deny access rights to repository definitions. The CDD/Repository
           protection provisions for definitions are consistent with
           VMS protection schemes. Also, CDD/Repository provides jour-
           naling capabilities that automatically protect repository
           sessions from system failures.


           Utilities/Interfaces

           Common Dictionary Operator (CDO)

           The CDO Utility is the command line interface to CDD/Repository,
           where users can accomplish the data description and repos-
           itory management functions. The CDO Utility supports the VMS
           style of command entry. A flexible menu-driven editor al-
           lows users to create new field and record definitions and
           browse through previously defined field and record defini-
           tions.

           Verify/Fix Utility

           The Verify/Fix Utility confirms and optionally restores the
           integrity of a repository.

           Call Interface

           System programmers, software engineers, and experienced ap-
           plication designers can directly invoke the object-oriented
           callable interface to CDD/Repository from user programs. Through
           this interface, applications call procedures send messages
           that affect repository elements. Using the call interface
           allows users direct access repositories without using the
           CDO utility.
