          PRODUCT NAME:  3270 Terminal Option Software, Version 1.1    SPD
          25.G5.01

          DESCRIPTION

          The 3270 Terminal Option Software is the operational firmware
          that is down-line loaded to a CXM04-* communication option card
          for the DECserver 550 or DECserver 510 Terminal Servers only.
          The 3270 Terminal Option Software allows supported 3270 type
          terminals attached to the CXM04 option card to interactively
          access host-based applications while at the same time continue
          operation with the IBM[R] host. This same ability is provided
          for personal computers (PCs) properly configured with one of
          the supported packages which emulate 3270 type terminals. The
          (actual or emulated) 3270 type terminal appears to the VMS
          Operating System as a VT220 type display. Due to the limitations
          of the 3270 device, not all VT220 features will operate. See the
          Restrictions section of this SPD for limitations.

          The 3270 Terminal Option Software controls terminal port charac-
          teristics as well as the IBM session support. The 3270 user can
          have access to both service nodes (hosts) and IBM host applica-
          tions. A hot-key sequence toggles the user from the IBM session
          to the VMS session. The 3270 Terminal Option Software interprets
          VT220 escape sequences and translates them to 3270 coax commands
          that are sent to the IBM 3270 display. The software also reads
          keystrokes and performs the reverse translation.

          A Set-Up menu selection is also provided. The menu, similar
          to the VT220 Set-Up menu, allows the user to define terminal
          characteristics as needed. The 3270 Terminal Option Software
          is down-line loaded over the network from a VMS Phase IV DECnet
          load host.

          3270 Terminal Option Software, Version 1.1          SPD 25.G5.01



          The 3270 Terminal option Software is designed to run on Digi-
          tal's CXM04-* hardware exclusively.

          The CXM04 hardware option has eight coax synchronous line inter-
          faces for connecting terminals and Cluster Control Units (CCUs)
          to the unit.

          Using the CXM04 hardware option, each port can be set up by the
          server manager to allow each terminal access to both Digital and
          IBM services (dynamic mode) or as a single service to Digital or
          IBM only.

          The CXM04 hardware option is compatible with Digital's DECserver
          550 or DECserver 510 Terminal Servers. DECserver 500 systems
          that have installed the DSRVS-UA upgrade are not compatible with
          the CXM04-* hardware option.

          Restrictions

          The 3270 Terminal Option Software has been designed to oper-
          ate with certain IBM class displays. However, some restric-
          tions/limitations do apply.

          o  Due to the limitation of the 3270 display, not all VT220
             features will operate.

          o  Some NON-IBM CUT type terminals/emulators are not supported.

          o  IBM 3270 DFT and compatible terminals are not supported.

          o  File transfers between PC's and VAX systems are not sup-
             ported.

          o  Hot-key sequences between IBM sessions and VAX sessions
             should ONLY be attempted when the 3270 display screen is
             not being updated. Hot-key sequences made during display
             screen updates MAY result in subsequent display screens being
             incorrect. The 3270 terminal option software will generate a
             message on the display if this occurs.
