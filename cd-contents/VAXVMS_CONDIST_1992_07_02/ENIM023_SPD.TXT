     PRODUCT NAME:  NMCC/VAX ETHERnim, Version 2.3       SPD 26.96.05

     DESCRIPTION

     NMCC/VAX ETHERnim is a network management application program
     that provides the network manager with a tool to gather informa-
     tion about Ethernet nodes, verify reachability of nodes, provide
     a graphical display of local area network topology, and monitor
     Ethernet traffic.

     NMCC/VAX ETHERnim consists of two categories of software. One
     must be installed on a VMS system set up as the Host, and the
     other can be optionally installed on Target systems running VMS.
     In this context, the Host is defined as the node on which the
     NMCC/VAX ETHERnim application runs, while the Target systems are
     the DECnet nodes on the Ethernet segments which are being tested
     at the User (task) level. The optional software installed on the
     Target system is referred to as the Remote files.

     The Host software requires Phase IV DECnet software on a VMS
     system. When this software has been installed, the network
     manager has the ability to:

     o  Test the Ethernet network to help isolate and identify a
        problem.
        NMCC/VAX ETHERnim performs path-testing to ISO model levels
        I and II for DECnet and non-DECnet nodes, and levels IV and
        VII for DECnet nodes. NMCC/VAX ETHERnim also recognizes non-
        DECnet Ethernet addresses. For any nodes on the Ethernet
        segments running DECnet Phase IV, NMCC/VAX ETHERnim performs
        path-testing to DNA network user layers. The results of path-
        testing are recorded in a session history file and saved in
        the database.

     o  Build a permanent database containing basic information
        about each node directly connected to the Ethernet local
        area network.
        Some information can be collected automatically, while other
        information can be collected by user command or by manual
        edit of the database. The database can then be expanded
        or manipulated by the NMCC/VAX ETHERnim user via various
        NMCC/VAX ETHERnim functions.
        When NMCC/VAX ETHERnim detects a new node, it creates for
        that node a database entry, which contains at least the Eth-
        ernet address. Examples of information that can be collected
        (depending on the type of Target node) are:

           DECnet Address
           Ethernet Port Type
           List of additional communications ports
           DECnet ID Message
           DECnet Address
           Hardware Address
           DECnet Management Version
           DECnet Router Version
           DECnet Router Type
           DECnet NSP Version
        Note:DECnet is required on the Target node in order to obtain
        all of the above information, with the exception of Ethernet
        Port Type and Hardware Address.

     The following information must be entered manually:

        -  Modem Phone Number

        -  Modem Speed

        -  Responsible Person

        -  Desk Phone Number

        -  System Location

        -  Descriptive Text

     o  Monitor the network to determine which nodes are the top
        talkers and which nodes are the top listeners; sort/display
        traffic by protocol type or multi-cast address; focus on
        traffic to/from a specified node.

     o  Manually construct and maintain a topological view of the
        network, including transparent network devices (e.g., DEMPR,
        DELNI, DEREP).

     The additional capability which is available with the installa-
     tion of the Remote files on the Target nodes is that capability
     which requires the explicit cooperation between the Host and
     Target nodes through DECnet task-to-task communication. This
     capability includes the ability to:

     o  Test the communications path to each node up to the DNA ap-
        plication layer by performing a loopback test to a specified
        user account. This feature is available only for VMS Target
        systems.

     o  Perform information access to DECnet nodes on the Ether-
        net to determine the remote node's system type, hardware
        configuration and software configuration.

     The Remote files can provide further information about Target
     nodes such as, Node Type, CPU Serial Number, CPU Type, Microcode
     Revision Level, Operating System Version, and Hardware revision
     level. This feature is available only for VMS Target systems.
