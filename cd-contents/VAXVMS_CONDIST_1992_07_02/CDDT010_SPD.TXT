           PRODUCT NAME:  CDD/Administrator for VMS, Version 1.0  SPD 32.72.00

           DESCRIPTION

           CDD/Administrator for VMS is a DECwindows Motif[TM]-based, fully cus-
           tomizable, graphical management tool for CDD/Repository. It allows per-
           sons who manage or administer repositories to locate, query, manip-
           ulate, manage, and report on objects stored in CDD/Repository through
           a graphical interface.

           Features

           o  DECwindows Graphical Interface - Provides an easy-to-use means of
              locating, querying, manipulating, and reporting on objects in CDD
              /Repository.

           o  Multiple Navigator Styles - Allows the repository administrator to
              chose one or more styles of graphical interface in navigating the
              contents of a CDD/Repository. The two major styles of navigators
              are hierarchical navigators that display objects in indented lists,
              and network navigators that display objects in a graphical form.

           o  Accessible Editors - An appropriate editor for a given object can
              be invoked by simply "clicking" with the mouse from any navigator.
              Alternatively, the repository administrator can invoke an editor
              on an object directly.

           o  Customizable Editors - Repository administrators can change edi-
              tors to match characteristics of new or existing object types. Ed-
              itors can also be changed to display the appropriate information
              for various classes of users.

           o  Ad-hoc and Canned Reporting - Ad-hoc reporting provides the flex-
              ibility to create reports to do any necessary analysis. Standard
              reports provide cost-effective reporting for repetitive repository
              administrative tasks. The standard report files can be created from
              any VAX/VMS or RISC/ULTRIX platform, whether DECwindows-based or not.

           o  Customized Reports - Customized reports can be created covering any
              objects stored in CDD/Repository, including any customer-made ex-
              tensions. This provides cost-effective support for customer-specific
              frequently used reports as well as support for less sophisticated
              users.

           o  Keywords - Can be defined and associated with objects stored in CDD
              /Repository and used in locating, querying, and reporting in CDD
              /Administrator. Keywords created through CDD/Administrator can also
              be used by any application layered on top of CDD/Repository.

           o  Work in Multiple Workspaces - Allows the repository administrator
              to switch between multiple workspaces or "contexts" within CDD/Repository.

           o  CDD/Repository Extensions - Repository administrators can extend
              CDD/Repository by adding new objects, protocols, or methods to an
              individual repository, or multiple repositories through the same
              graphical interface used to manage existing objects in CDD/Repository.

           o  Callable Interface - Allows the use of the functionality of CDD/Administrator
              in CSO's products. This provides a consistent "look and feel" to
              navigators, editors, and reports layered on CDD/Repository across
              multiple tools and platforms.

           HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

           Processor and/or hardware configuration as specified in the System Sup-
           port Addendum (SSA 32.72.00-x).

           Note: CDD/Administrator has one shareable image and that image must be
           installed on the node from which a customer is going to invoke the im-
           age. However, the display can be directed to any DECwindows-compliant
           display device, such as a workstation or DECwindows-compliant video
           terminal.
