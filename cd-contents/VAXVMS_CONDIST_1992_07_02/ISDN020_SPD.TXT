 PRODUCT NAME:  VAX ISDN, Version 2.0                   SPD 31.23.02

 DESCRIPTION

 The VAX ISDN communication software product allows suitably config-
 ured VMS systems to connect to ISDN networks based upon the correspond-
 ing CCITT Recommendations via a Basic Rate access. Connections are es-
 tablished using the circuit-switched access of the ISDN networks. Ta-
 ble 1 and Table 2 in this Software Product Description (SPD) list the
 VAX ISDN public networks supported and tested.

 VAX ISDN is a VMS layered product that provides circuit-switched call
 control functions. This allows data transfers over one or two B-channels
 provided by the ISDN network at a Basic Rate access, using the fol-
 lowing protocols:

 o  DECnet-VAX Phase IV or DECnet-VAX Version 5.4 Extensions:

    VAX ISDN allows using DECnet-VAX "circuits" to remote DECnet nodes
    across the ISDN network.

    Note: A DECnet license is required to communicate with other DEC-
    net nodes over such circuits.

 o  VAX Packetnet System Interface (P.S.I.):

    VAX ISDN also allows using X.25 network protocol (VAX P.S.I. V4.3)
    for communication across the ISDN network.

 o  Specific Protocols:

    VAX ISDN also allows using specific network protocols (DDCMP and
    HDLC) for communication across the ISDN network.

                               DIGITAL                  January 1992

                                                         AE-NS24C-TE

 

 VAX ISDN provides the following functions at the VAX node physically
 connected to the ISDN network:

 o  The ability to support three modes of operation at the controller
    level:

    -  Simple mode - Calls are set up and cleared whenever explicitly
       requested either by a system operator or an application program.

    -  Authorized mode - The only difference between this mode and sim-
       ple mode is that incoming calls that pass the incoming setup in-
       formation filter are accepted only after they have been explic-
       itly authorized by an application program.

    -  Time-cutting mode - Automatically establishes a circuit-switched
       connection to a predefined destination and minimizes circuit us-
       age cost by automatically clearing a communication when no user
       or network management data has been transferred for a user-specified
       length of time. This technique is called "time-cutting."
    Controller level means both units (each B-channel of the S0 basic
    rate access corresponds to one unit) must work with the same mode.

 o  The ability for user-written programs running under VMS to control
    incoming and outgoing calls. The following programming languages
    are supported:

    -  VAX C

    -  VAX Pascal

    An ISDN Network Control Program (ISDN$NCP) is provided for manage-
    ment of VAX ISDN. This interface allows establishing outgoing calls,
    specifying ISDN addressing information and incoming call filters,
    accessing statistical information, requesting options or facili-
    ties and performing maintenance functions (such as setting the op-
    erating mode).

    With the Phase IV version of VAX ISDN, a special security function
    is provided which allows users to limit the access to ISDN$NCP or
    ISDN$SA to a limited number of users on the local node or remote

                                  2

 

    users operating VAX ISDN ACCESS. This function does not exist with
    VAX ISDN when used on a node running DECnet VAX Extension.

    Problem solving is facilitated by the ability to trace and analyze
    data transferred between the ISDN network and the various layers
    of the VAX ISDN software over the D-channel of the Basic Rate ac-
    cess.

 o  The ability to establish and control ISDN connections using VMS DCL
    commands. Three new DCL commands are added to the DCL tables: ISDN
    CALL, ISDN CLEAR and ISDN SHOW CALLS. Using these commands, any user
    may request the automatic establishment of an ISDN connection and
    may clear it without knowing the specific parameters of the phys-
    ical unit being used. Before having these commands fully operational
    on the VMS system, the system or network manager must configure some
    tables as described in the chapter "Call Management Software" of
    the Management Guide.

 o  The options and network facilities supported by VAX ISDN vary ac-
    cording to the local ISDN network in use. Table 4 lists the options
    that VAX ISDN is capable of supporting.

 Note: A VAX ISDN ACCESS (SPD 31.24.xx) license is required for control-
 ling incoming and outgoing calls from remote VMS user programs and for
 managing the VAX ISDN product from a remote ISDN Network Control Pro-
 gram.

 INSTALLATION

 Digital recommends that a customer's first purchase of this software
 include Digital Installation Services. These services provide for in-
 stallation of the software product by an experienced Digital Software
 Specialist.

 Customer Responsibilities





                                  3

 

 In some cases, the ISDN network supplier imposes restrictions, lim-
 itations, or requirements on the proposed Digital network configura-
 tion, options, and facilities. The customer must understand and ad-
 here to these requirements for each and every ISDN network used.

 Before installation of the software, the customer must:

 o  Previously have installed all prerequisite software and hardware,
    including terminals.

 During installation, the appropriate kit (Phase IV or Phase V) is au-
 tomatically selected from the VAX ISDN distribution media depending
 on the DECnet-VAX version running at that time on the system. However,
 if the system is upgraded with DECnet-VAX Extensions later, the VAX
 ISDN kit will have to be re-installed.

 Digital's Installation Services also require that the customer must:

 o  Have an ISDN Basic Rate Access (S0) line already installed.

 o  Make available for a reasonable period of time, as mutually agreed
    by Digital and the customer, all hardware, communication facili-
    ties, and terminals that are to be used during installation.

 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

 Processor and/or hardware configuration as specified in the System Sup-
 port Addendum (SSA 31.23.02-x).

 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

 VMS Operating System

 Refer to the System Support Addendum (SSA 31.23.02-x) for availabil-
 ity and required versions of prerequisite/optional software.

 Options and Facility Support

 VAX ISDN support for any given ISDN option or facility depends on sup-
 port for it in the corresponding ISDN network. Generally, the VAX ISDN
 design includes restrictions on the use of options or network facil-
 ities, and prevents the use of facilities not supported by the local
 ISDN network.

 Therefore, Table 4 at the end of this SPD is to be interpreted as what
 VAX ISDN is capable of using, rather than what it will do when used
 on any particular ISDN network. The product documentation describes
 specific options, restrictions, and facilities available for the sup-
 ported public ISDN networks.
