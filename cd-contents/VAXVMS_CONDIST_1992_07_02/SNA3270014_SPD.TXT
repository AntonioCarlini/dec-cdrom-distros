PRODUCT NAME: DECnet/SNA VMS 3270 Data Stream                  SPD 26.87.05
              Programming Interface, Version 1.4  

DESCRIPTION

The DECnet/SNA VMS 3270 Data Stream Programming Interface (3270 DS) is a 
layered software product that allows user-written applications running on 
suitably configured VMS systems within a DECnet network or on suitable VMS 
systems within a VMS/SNA environment to exchange messages with cooperating 
applications in an IBM host. The 3270 DS software exists in the VMS system as a 
shareable image.  Access between the cooperating DIGITAL and IBMROF
ROIBM is a registered trademark of International Business Machines, Inc.
F applications 
is via the DECnet/SNA Gateway or via VMS/SNA software. 

The 3270 DS programming interface is a collection of subroutines designed to 
provide an easy-to-use interface for the DECnet/SNA Gateway (or VMS/SNA) 
application programmer who has a specific need to interface to an IBM 
application subsystem which uses LU Type 2 (LU2) protocol. The product can be 
used with many types of applications. As an example, a customized 3270 terminal 
emulator application can be written by a user and layered on top of 3270 DS. 
Applications can be event driven or synchronous in nature with no loss in 
available functions. 

Features

The 3270 DS product is designed to insulate the VMS application programmer from 
the inner workings of the SNA network environment as much as possible, thus 
allowing the user to concentrate on solving the application problem. The 
product performs the following SNA functions on the user's behalf: 

oo Receives and interprets the bind

oo Accepts the bind and starts the session

oo Maintains the state machines for chaining, bracketing, and data flow   
  control 

oo Processes an Unbind Type 2 automatically

As a result, the VMS user is required to perform a minimum of SNA functions 
including processing the CLEAR and CANCEL functions and handling contention. 

This product is a set of subroutines used to perform such functions as 
establishing sessions, sending data, receiving data, and disconnecting 
sessions. In addition, the 3270 DS interface may be used to interpret the 3270 
data stream and build a screen image. The VMS application is then free to 
interact with the screen image. 

The 3270 DS product allows two modes of connection: Data Stream Mode and Field 
Mode. 

Data Stream Mode 

Data Stream Mode provides a means to send and receive uninterpreted 3270 data 
streams as defined by IBM. In this mode, all SNA specific functions are 
performed by the interface. For example, the VMS application is not required to 
handle chaining, brackets, RUs, or RHs. At the same time, this mode allows the 
interface to provide the VMS application with the complete 3270 data stream. It 
is the VMS user's responsibility to interpret the outbound data stream for 3270 
orders and commands, and to build and manipulate a screen image (if desired). 
Similarly, it is the VMS user's responsibility to build the inbound data stream 
from his own screen image or from some other data structure. 

A VMS application which needs to use extended attributes must use a Data Stream 
Mode connection. Extended attributes are extensions to the basic field 
attributes, namely: 

oo Extended highlighting (blink, reverse video, underscore)

oo Color

oo Programmed symbols (selectable symbol set)

oo Screen partitions and windows

Field Mode

Field Mode performs a presentation service to provide a screen image interface. 
The screen image may be read field by field, or accessed directly. The 
interface interprets 3270 commands and orders in an outbound data stream to 
build the screen. In addition, it produces an inbound 3270 data stream from the 
updated screen image. 

As with the Data Stream Mode, Field Mode insulates the VMS user from the SNA 
protocol. Extended attributes are not supported by the Field Mode connection. 

Asynchronous Event Notification 

The 3270 DS product provides a mechanism for a VMS user application to receive 
control when an asynchronous ``network event'' occurs such as disconnection of 
a DECnet logical link, an SNA circuit failure, or the receipt of an Unbind Type 
2 from IBM. The VMS application is called at a notification entry point defined 
by the application at connection time; an indication of the event that occurred 
is reported. 

User Interface 

Users of the DECnet/SNA VMS 3270 DS product should be experienced VMS 
application programmers. They can use any of the VMS programming languages 
which conform to the VMS Calling Standard to create application programs which 
interact with application programs on an IBM system. The user documentation 
provides example segments written in the following languages: 

oo MACRO-32

oo VAX BLISS-32 Implementation Language

oo VAX C

oo VAX COBOL

oo VAX FORTRAN

oo VAX PASCAL

oo VAX PL/I

The users of the 3270 DS product are not required to have extensive knowledge 
of SNA. 

Features of Version 1.4

oo VMS 3270 DS V1.4 supports Digital's License Management Facility.

oo VMS 3270 DS V1.4 allows, on supported DECnet/SNA gateways and VMS/SNA 
  systems, secured Logical Unit (LU) access via the SNA3270$REQUEST_CONNECT 
  procedure call.

INSTALLATION

Only experienced customers should attempt installation of this product. DIGITAL 
recommends that all other customers purchase DIGITAL's Installation Services.  
These services provide for installation of the software product by an 
experienced DIGITAL Software Specialist. 

Customer Responsibilities

Before DIGITAL installation of the software the customer must:
     
oo Have previously installed all requisite hardware including terminals and 
  DECnet/SNA gateway products.

oo Obtain, install, and demonstrate as operational any modems and other 
  equipment and facilities necessary to interface to DIGITAL's communications 
  equipment.   

oo Have generated, to DIGITAL's satisfaction, any necessary IBM host software 
  that will be communicating with the DECnet/SNA gateway or VMS/SNA and the 
  3270 DS Programming Interface.

oo Make available for a reasonable period of time, as mutually agreed by DIGITAL 
  and the customer, all hardware, communications facilities, and terminals that 
  are to be used during installation.

Delays caused by any failure to meet these responsibilities will be charged at 
the prevailing rate for time and materials. 

Successful use of this product requires that:

oo The customer must be prepared to work with both DIGITAL and IBM systems 
  personnel to coordinate the pre-installation activities.

oo The customer should be capable of modifying IBM component generation 
  parameters to support either the DECnet/SNA gateway or VMS/SNA and the 3270 
  DS Programming Interface.
