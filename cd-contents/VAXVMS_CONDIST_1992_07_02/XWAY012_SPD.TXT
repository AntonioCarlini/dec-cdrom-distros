          PRODUCT NAME:  VAX Xway, Version 1.2                SPD 27.36.03

          DESCRIPTION

          VAX Xway is a spreadsheet model and data conversion application.
          It is designed for use with spreadsheets, database managers,
          and any other application which produces or accepts data in one
          of the supported storage formats. It performs the conversion of
          constant data (numbers and text) between all supported formats.
          Additionally, VAX Xway performs the conversion of spreadsheet
          models between those selected formats which store relationships,
          formulas, and formats as well as constant data.

          The supported storage formats are:

          o  WKS - LOTUS 1-2-3[R] Release 1 and 1A spreadsheet formats

                WK1 - LOTUS 1-2-3 Release 2.00 and 2.01 spreadsheet for-
                mats

                WRK - LOTUS Symphony[TM] Release 1.0 spreadsheet format

          o  DIF[R] - Data Interchange Format (used by products such as
             VisiCalc[TM] and SuperCalc[TM]).

          o  SYLK - Symbolic Link File Format (used by products such as
             Multiplan[TM]).

          o  VAX DECalc, VAX DECalc-PLUS or VAX Xway-produced Command
             files.

          o  ASCII tabular data with a specified separator (e.g., tabs,
             spaces, commas, hyphens) between each data element. This
             is used by products such as dBASE III[TM], VAX DECalc, VAX
             DECalc-PLUS, Supercomp-Twenty[TM], 20/20[TM] and C-CALC[R].

                                       DIGITAL                   July 1990

          o  ASCII data which can be described as fields, with fields
             being identified by starting location, length, and data type.
             Examples include FORTRAN ASCII data files, PL/I ASCII data
             files and most database records.

          Spreadsheet model conversion is supported between the WKS, WK1,
          WRK, SYLK and VAX DECalc/VAX
          DECalc-PLUS command file storage formats.

          Xway can not read 8-bit characters from the following input
          formats: DIF, SYLK, and DECalc or DECalc-PLUS. This means that
          certain multi-national characters cannot be translated from
          these input formats. This is not a restriction on any other
          input format or on any output format.

          Features

          Standard features include:

          o  Translation of spreadsheet context information such as global
             formatting, cell formatting, global column width, individual
             column widths, named areas, and cursor location.

          o  Special case translations that allow spreadsheet compati-
             bility between functions and expressions that are not alike.
             For example, some of the LOTUS functions are translated into
             equivalent algebraic DECalc and DECalc-PLUS expressions.

          o  Saving often-used translation/exchange descriptions in defi-
             nition files so that you can easily repeat exchanges.

          o  Extensive translation reporting to the screen or to a user-
             specified log file.

          o  Works with local files or remote files over a network.

          VAX Xway also provides the following optional methods of manipu-
          lating the data and models:

          o  When converting from one model storage format to another, the
             user can request that only the constant data contained in the

             input file be converted. Any formulas contained in the input
             file are not converted.

          o  For any of the supported storage formats, the user can chose
             to have the data moved to another location in the output
             file. The data can be relocated by any number of rows or
             columns in any direction.

          o  For any of the supported storage formats, the user can choose
             to have the data in the input file transposed when it is
             written in the new format to the output file. For example,
             data that was previously in a column would be in a row.

          Interface

          VAX Xway has an easy-to-use interactive interface which leads a
          user through the steps to convert data from one storage format
          to another. At any point the user can access context sensitive
          help. Once the user has gone through the sequence of questions,
          the responses can be saved for future use. For the more so-
          phisticated user, an extensive command line interface is also
          provided.

          Additionally, VAX Xway provides a callable interface to inte-
          grate Xway functions into customized applications. Application
          programmers can call VAX Xway from any VAX higher level lan-
          guage supporting the VMS calling standard. All the necessary
          details (including entry points, calling modes, program return
          values, and data structures) are clearly discussed in the Xway
          Programmer's Guide.
