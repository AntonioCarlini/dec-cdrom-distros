           PRODUCT NAME:  IEX-VMS-DRIVER, Version 4.2C  SPD 26.30.08

           DESCRIPTION

           IEX-VMS-DRIVER allows programs written in MACRO-32 and higher
           level languages (such as VAX FORTRAN, VAX BASIC and VAX Pascal)
           to communicate through the IEU11-A or IEQ11-A with devices
           containing an IEC 625-1 or IEEE Std. 488 interface. This com-
           munication is implemented through a choice of direct QIO calls
           or a set of subroutines callable from high level languages.

           Note: In the following description the term IEX11 stands for
           the IEU11-A and/or IEQ11-A interface. The (IEU11-A) supports
           the VMS UNIBUS machines, and the IEQ11-A supports the Mi-
           croVMS Q-bus machines.)

           The IEX11-A interface is a bit-parallel byte-serial device
           which can perform transfers in either program interrupt or
           DMA (direct memory access) mode. Program interrupt is used
           for transferring commands and addresses, while DMA is used
           for transferring data. DMA significantly reduces processor
           loading during the transfer of long data buffers.

           The IEX11-A interface contains two independent IEC/IEEE bus
           controllers, also known as General Purpose Interface Buses
           (GPIBs). These two controllers may be connected to the same
           or to different IEC/IEEE buses. Up to 15 devices may be at-
           tached to each IEC/IEEE bus.

           The IEX11 is most commonly used as Controller-in-Charge, but
           can also be used when another device is Controller-in-Charge.
           The Controller-in-Charge directs the sequence of informa-
           tion on the bus.

           When the IEX11 acts as Controller-in-Charge, it may request
           status information from other devices through serial and par-
           allel polling. When the IEX11 is not Controller-in-Charge,
           it can be polled in either fashion to provide status infor-
           mation.

           Features

           The IEX-VMS-DRIVER supports the following IEC/IEEE hardware
           capabilities:

           o  Controller (C1, C2, C3, C4, C5)

           o  Talker and Extended Talker (T5, TE5)

           o  Listener and Extended Listener (L3, LE3)

           The event recognition facility allows the user's process to
           specify the events on the IEC/IEEE instrument bus which the
           interface should detect. The interface is capable of detect-
           ing the occurrence of the following events:

           *  Functions that can only be used by the Controller-in-Charge

           ** Functions used only by a device that is not Controller-
              in-Charge

           All IEC/IEEE bus commands are issued through a process re-
           quest and all data is transferred through the DMA mechanism.
           When the IEX-VMS-DRIVER is processing a read data request,
           the three ways to detect the end of the data transfer are:

              Byte Count Overflow - Transfer terminates after the spec-
              ified number of bytes have been read.

              EOI Termination - Transfer terminates if, during the re-
              ception of a byte, the EOI line is true.

              Match Character - Transfer terminates after the Termi-
              nation specified match character has been consecutively
              received the specified number of times.

           A device exerciser is provided to verify that the IEX-VMS-
           DRIVER is correctly installed and to aid the user in test-
           ing an application. When the two bus controllers are con-
           nected with a loop back cable (refer to the  IEU11-A/IEQ11-
           A User's Guide), the device exerciser can be run with com-
           mand files delivered with the exerciser. These command files
           demonstrate all features of the driver and the IEC/IEEE bus
           interface functions. The device exerciser can also be used
           by the user in a dialogue mode to test devices. The commands
           to the exerciser are directly converted into QIOs to the driver.
           Using the exerciser in the dialogue mode, the user can quickly
           determine the set of QIOs required for an application.

           The IEX-VMS-DRIVER may be programmed in the following two
           ways:

           VMS and MicroVMS QIO System Service - The VMS QIO requests
           allow direct access to the driver. These requests can be is-
           sued in higher level languages (such as VAX FORTRAN, VAX BASIC,
           VAX Pascal and MACRO-32). This is the most flexible way of
           programming the IEX11 device, but requires the user to be
           familiar with the QIO calling procedures.

           Simplified User Interface - This is a package of subroutines
           which can be called from higher level languages (such as VAX FORTRAN
           and VAX BASIC) to perform the following functions:

           IESTRT -  Initialize an interface

           IEPOLL -  Setup for Serial polling

           IESEND -  Send data

           IERECV -  Receive data

           IERQSV -  Request service

           IECMD  -  Perform a bus control function

           IEWFE  -  Wait for IEC/IEEE bus event
