 PRODUCT NAME:  Terminal Server Manager, Version 1.6    SPD 27.64.07

 DESCRIPTION

 Terminal Server Manager (TSM) VMS software allows suitably privileged
 users on a VAX host to control and observe terminal servers anywhere
 in the extended local area network. TSM provides centralization and
 increased flexibility in configuring, monitoring, and controlling Dig-
 ital Equipment Corporation's family of terminal servers.

 TSM's enhancements provide management support for Digital's newest ad-
 dition of Terminal Servers - DECserver 700, DECserver 90L+, DECserver
 90TL, as well as upgraded support for DECserver 90L. It also includes
 an automated database conversion from TSM V1.5 to TSM V1.6. The new
 TRIGGER SERVER command enables a reboot to an unattended or remote ter-
 minal server.

 Features

 Telnet Functionality

 TSM supports a new set of server commands to provide management of the
 Telnet characteristics of a terminal server.

 Management Directory

 TSM provides a directory that contains the name, Ethernet address, ter-
 minal server type, and other fields for each server to be managed. Through
 the TSM directory, the user needs to refer only to the name of the server
 to gain access.

 Server Selection

                               DIGITAL                    April 1992

                                                         AE-JE80J-TE

 

 TSM provides a USE command to allow selection of the server or servers
 to be managed, or the directory to be referenced. TSM allows the user
 to manage, from one server, all of the servers in the directory at a
 time. The user can choose to manage a partition of servers, all servers
 of a specified type, or all servers matching a wildcarded server or
 partition specification.

 Volatile Characteristics

 TSM manages the volatile characteristics for all terminal server types.

 Permanent Characteristics

 TSM manages permanent NVRAM characteristics for the DECserver 100, DEC-
 server 200, DECserver 250, DECserver 300, DECserver 90L, DECserver 90L+,
 DECserver 90TL, DECserver 700, MUXserver 100, MUXserver 300, and MUXserver
 380. For the Ethernet Terminal Server and DECserver 500, TSM modifies
 the permanent attributes contained within the image files that are down-
 line loaded.

 Terminal Server Trigger

 Capability via TSM that will cause the server to load with whatever
 server software is specified in NVRAM.

 Database Manipulation

 TSM can access and manipulate the database associated with each server
 within its jurisdiction, including their characteristics and param-
 eters.

 DECnet Database Modification

 TSM automatically updates the DECnet database for servers to match the
 DECnet related information in the management directory. It is not nec-
 essary for users to employ a separate DSVCONFIG or TSVNCP configura-
 tion program.

 3270 Option Software

                                  2

 

 TSM provides support for the 3270 Option Software for the CXM04 line
 card. This line card provides the capability to connect the 3270 class
 of terminals to systems on Ethernet.

 Keyboard Mapping

 This functionality enables the terminal server manager to customize
 3270 keyboard tables supplied with the 3270 Option Software by chang-
 ing the way individual 3270 keyboard keys are mapped to Digital's VT220
 keys.

 DCL Command

 TSM commands may be issued as DCL commands; the syntax follows DCL con-
 ventions.

 Command Files

 Command files may be maintained outside TSM (e.g., by use of a VAX/VMS
 editor). This command file support allows values of characteristics
 to be stored on the host, effectively creating a copy of the perma-
 nent database that may be used to configure new servers. Server main-
 tenance is also enhanced by allowing the terminal server to be eas-
 ily box swapped and parameters reset. Up to eight parameters may be
 passed to TSM command files. Additionally, command files may operate
 on a single server, on a logical group (a partition) of servers, or
 on all servers.

 Fault Management

 Troubleshooting within the terminal server network is enhanced by TSM
 providing the ability, centrally, to read traffic status and counters
 in addition to error status and counters. With the ``PASTHRU'' com-
 mand, the user can also connect directly to the server without using
 TSM, allowing isolation of problems between TSM and the server.

 A simple connectivity test to a specific server or all servers listed
 in the directory is provided with an informational message displayed
 for each server not responding. TSM allows the user to check period-
 ically for non-functioning terminal servers. This function might be
 performed from within a batch job, to run without user involvement,

                                  3

 

 but informing the appropriate personnel if a server connectivity prob-
 lem is detected.

 Via the TEST DELAY command, users can measure timing delays associ-
 ated with data transmission to and from servers.

 The TEST CONNECTION command tests the ability to submit a print job
 to a server port.

 Terminal Server Manager supports terminal servers running the follow-
 ing software:
