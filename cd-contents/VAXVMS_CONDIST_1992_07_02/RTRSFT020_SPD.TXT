           PRODUCT NAME: DEC Reliable Transaction       SPD 34.30.00
                         Router[TM] (RTR) for VMS, Version 2.0

           DESCRIPTION

           DEC Reliable Transaction Router (RTR) for VMS is the imple-
           mentation of the Reliable Transaction Router on VMS. It is
           a reliable, transparent, message routing system that includes
           both a transactional and non-transactional message control
           system. DEC RTR implements automatic application software
           fault tolerance and failure recovery on the VMS Operating
           System by adapting to hardware (CPU), communications, and
           application software failures. DEC RTR for VMS provides the
           users the ability to easily partition multiple application
           programs over DECnet Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area
           Networks (WANs). Ease of development features include both
           a Requester (Client)/Server design environment, with optional
           all-or-nothing transaction semantics, as well as a message
           broadcasting facility. DEC RTR implements virtual, rather
           than physical, networks which provide the application de-
           veloper with a "single view" of a distributed client/server
           environment. This technique allows the application software
           to be independent of physical hardware (CPU) location, net-
           work naming conventions, and communications protocol.

           DEC RTR for VMS is implemented by providing the programmer
           with nine system services to develop distributed applica-
           tions. This call interface conforms to the VMS calling stan-
           dard. In addition to the standard system service call in-
           terface, DEC RTR for VMS includes a run-time library (RTR-
           RTL) for the VMS language family to facilitate application
           development in high level programming languages. The RTR call
           interface functions are also made available at the Digital

           DEC Reliable Transaction Router[TM] (RTR)   SPD 34.30.00
           for VMS, Version 2.0

           Command Language (DCL) level in both their synchronous and
           asynchronous forms.

           DEC RTR for VMS provides application software Fault Toler-
           ant features such as shadow-server processing, standby-server
           processing, and callout servers to implement user authen-
           tication control, as well as concurrent servers with dynamic
           message queue load balancing for high performance. The high
           performance transactional messaging is implemented as a full-
           duplex, conversational remote procedure call (RPC) using real-
           time flow control techniques. These features generally re-
           quire no special user application programming logic.

           The System Management interface allows the dynamic creation,
           deletion, and monitoring of multiple, independent virtual
           networks within a network. In addition, the monitoring util-
           ity can be invoked from any system, with suitable privileges,
           to gather and report distributed application performance statis-
           tics. The DEC RTR for VMS System Management interface is used
           to bind the physical hardware (CPU and communications) to
           a virtual network namespace and is completely transparent
           to the application software. Several levels of physical and
           logical security can be controlled via the System Manage-
           ment interface. Additional security is provided at run-time
           through the RTR call interface.

           DEC RTR for VMS is both forms/window management systems and
           database independent. Application server features allow trans-
           action consistent access to Digital and non-Digital database
           products within the same network-wide distributed transac-
           tion.

           DEC RTR for VMS is primarily intended for production sys-
           tems in large distributed environments that require fron-
           tend forms independence and backend server database inde-
           pendence (e.g., trading/money dealing systems, telecommu-
           nication systems, etc.). DEC RTR for VMS can also be used
           in general distributed transaction systems that require re-
           liable messaging and fault tolerant application control over

           for VMS, Version 2.0

           local and/or wide area networks. DEC RTR for VMS provides
           the enabling technology for applications requiring fully dis-
           tributed client-server models rather than a distributed database
           model.


           Features

           DEC RTR for VMS primary features :

           o  Provides transparent, value-based transaction routing for
              client-server applications in a distributed system.

           o  Allows user-defined partitioned data models (value-based
              routing) for increasing the performance of user appli-
              cations in a local and/or wide-area network.

           o  Acts as a layer between the application requesters and
              servers thus decoupling the end-to-end relationship nor-
              mally required by user application control. This provides
              the application developer with a "single" system view of
              the programming environment over multiple hardware sys-
              tems located on a LAN and/or WAN.

           o  Ensures atomicity of transactions (all or nothing) by us-
              ing a two-phase commit protocol to guarantee conversa-
              tional message delivery among one or more application servers.

           o  Offers at-most-once semantics for valid transactions. This
              includes transaction replay to a surviving application
              server after hardware or user application failure.

           o  Disaster protection and recovery (e.g., site failure) is
              automatically provided by mirroring transactions in shadow-
              server environments.

           o  Supports multiple (concurrent) servers as well as multi-
              threaded requesters and/or servers.

           DEC Reliable Transaction Router[TM] (RTR)   SPD 34.30.00
           for VMS, Version 2.0

           o  Enables transparent and automatic failover/failback of
              application servers on multiple backend systems within
              a VAXcluster while remaining transparent to application
              requesters executing on a remote frontend system(s). DEC
              RTR for VMS can maintain application operation in many
              instances of single or multiple failure modes in a widely
              distributed software/hardware configuration.

           o  Includes system management utilities for online monitor-
              ing and system control of virtual networks from any work-
              station or terminal with the appropiate privileges. This
              feature includes the monitoring of statistics, software
              and hardware states, requesters/servers, and system man-
              ager control of distributed RTR applications.

           o  Provides a synchronous as well as asynchronous DCL in-
              terface to all RTR system services. This feature is in-
              tended to facilitate application prototyping and debug-
              ging.

           o  DEC RTR for VMS maintains near linear performance scal-
              ing over a wide range of configurations allowing easy hor-
              izontal expansion of both hardware systems and applica-
              tion software.
