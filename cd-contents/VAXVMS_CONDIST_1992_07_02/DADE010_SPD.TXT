 PRODUCT NAME:  DECimage EXpress, Version 2.0           SPD 37.41.00

 DESCRIPTION

 DECimage EXpress includes two components: DECimage EXpress (Client and
 Server) and DECimage EXpress Application Development Environment.

 DECimage EXpress is a ready-to-use and functional document imaging sys-
 tem. This scaleable system is designed to operate as a combination of
 specified hardware and software components. The hardware portion in-
 cludes VAX-supported processors and client support for PCs and Work-
 stations (refer to the System Support Addendum, SSA 37.41.00-x) and
 image-capable Digital Equipment Corporation X-Terminals. Using this
 combination, DECimage EXpress delivers the ability to convert a paper-
 based information system to an online, image-based information sys-
 tem. Among the capabilities of DECimage EXpress are the basic docu-
 ment image management functions of capture, index, storage, retrieval,
 distribution, and system management.

 In addition, DECimage EXpress Application Development Environment is
 the VAX C callable application programming interface that is used to
 extend the DECimage EXpress application system. This functionality is
 provided by a set of routines used by the DECimage EXpress System Ad-
 ministration, Data Storage, and Document Indexing subsystems to ac-
 cess documents within DECimage EXpress. This enables the user to tai-
 lor the end product to the specific situation at hand.

 DECimage EXpress has the following functionality:

 o  Acquisition

    -  Supports importing documents directly from magnetic cache or from
       a local scanner

       pre-specified document in a collection of documents

    -  Allows accelerated next-consecutive-page performance

    -  Supports zoom, rotate, pan/scroll, and image scale, including
       original paper size, fit width, fit height, and fit within win-
       dow

    -  Supports cropping of document images

    -  Allows selected view settings to be saved and restored

 o  Scaleable Storage

    -  Provides a single server source of image data that can be stored

       gration to and from optical disks, as well as the deletion of
       purged documents

    -  Registration and definition of:

       o  All nodes to access DECimage EXpress

       o  Devices to be accessed by users

       o  Drawers to contain image documents

       images to and from magnetic and optical storage; purge images
       from the database, and configure the storage server

 System Performance:

 Performance is highly dependent upon the particular hardware and soft-
 ware configuration being used, the number of active users on the sys-
 tem, and the images (type, density, etc.) being processed.
