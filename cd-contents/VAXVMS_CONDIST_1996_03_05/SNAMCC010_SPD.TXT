 PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER SNA Manager, Version 1.0     SPD 43.22.00
                (DECmcc SNA Management)

 INTRODUCTION

 The POLYCENTER SNA Manager enables the DECmcc Basic Management Sys-
 tem to manage IBM(R) SNA network resources remotely. As a linking mech-
 anism between Digital Equipment Corporation's ADVANTAGE-NETWORKS and
 IBM's SNA network environments, POLYCENTER SNA Manager allows the peer-
 to-peer, bi-directional passing of commands, responses, and events be-
 tween Digital and IBM network management systems.

 POLYCENTER SNA Manager resides in the Digital environment and makes
 up one half of an internetwork management facility. Coupled with Sys-
 tems Center, Inc.'s (SCI) SOLVE:Connect(R) product, the other half of
 the management facility, POLYCENTER SNA Manager allows DECmcc users
 to manage and control SNA resources. Furthermore, POLYCENTER SNA Man-
 ager and SOLVE:Connect allow users of SCI's Advanced System Manage-
 ment (ASM[TM]) or IBM's NetView(R) management software to manage and con-
 trol resources manageable via DECmcc.

 The path for commands/responses and event flows consists of a pair of
 LU6.2 sessions between POLYCENTER SNA Manager and SOLVE:Connect. Dig-
 ital's DECnet/SNA Transport products provide the transport mechanisms
 for the flow of data between the ADVANTAGE-NETWORKS and SNA network-
 ing environments.

 DESCRIPTION

 POLYCENTER SNA Manager provides the following capabilities in the man-
 agement of Digital's ADVANTAGE-NETWORKS and SNA networks:

 o  Exchange of commands and responses among ASM, NetView, and DECmcc.
    This exchange takes place using a slightly modified version of CMIP
    over APPC, which was agreed upon by Digital and SCI engineers. This
    includes user-defined alarms on SNA resource attribute values and
    alerts. These exchanges take place through the use of Digital's DEC-
    net/SNA gateway products.

 o  Control and monitor SNA resources such as LUs, lines, cluster con-
    trollers, host nodes, etc. from DECmcc's function and presentation
    modules, including the Iconic Map PM, Forms and Command Line PM,
    Alarms FM, Historian FM, Domain FM, and custom applications.

 o  Directives are the means to initiate management operations. Direc-
    tives are organized into three groups: examination, modification,
    and action. POLYCENTER SNA Manager directives are listed below:

    -  ACQUIRE: Instructs SNA host node to assume ownership of an SNA
       resource

    -  ACTIVATE: Requests the start-up of an SNA resource and its de-
       fined objects

    -  DEREGISTER: Deletes SNA node information from the DECmcc MIR

    -  DIRECTORY: Lists all SNA node entity instances registered to DECmcc

    -  DISABLE: Turns off SNA resources and functions with no required
       arguments

    -  ENABLE: Turns on SNA resources and functions with no required
       arguments

    -  ERASE: Removes an entity from DECmcc configuration

    -  EXECUTE: Sends text-string commands to Service Points and Ser-
       vice Point Applications, and pass-through commands to SOLVE:Connect

    -  GET_EVENT: Causes SNA AM to return an event defined within the
       directive arguments

                                  2

 

    -  INACTIVATE: Requests the de-activation of an SNA resource

    -  MODIFY_TRACE: Requests the modification of VTAM tracing

    -  QUERY: Prompts an SPA or one of its resources for attribute in-
       formation

    -  REGISTER: Adds SNA node information to the DECmcc MIR

    -  RELEASE: Forces an SNA node to release a previously acquired re-
       source

    -  SESSION_TRACE: Instructs SOLVE:Connect to perform a session trace
       command

    -  SET: Changes an attribute value in a specified entity

    -  SHOW: Retrieves current attribute values for the named entity

    -  TERMINATE_SESSION: Disconnects a session or group of sessions

    -  TEST: Performs entity class validity check, route tests, and other
       diagnostic routines.

 o  Execution of directives in ASM or NetView to manage DECmcc controlled
    resources such as DECnet/OSI nodes, DECnet Phase IV nodes, TCP/IP
    nodes, Ethernet, Bridges, etc. from SNA. Through POLYCENTER SNA Man-
    ager and SOLVE:Connect, an ASM or NetView user is able to issue most
    of the same directives that may be issued from the DECmcc Forms and
    Command Line (FCL) presentation module, such as SHOW, SET, GET_EVENT,
    PASS, BLOCK, IGNORE. As additional DECmcc management modules are
    installed, they also become accessible from ASM or NetView. The fol-
    lowing commands are NOT supported by POLYCENTER SNA Manager:

       CAPTURE
       DEFINE
       DISPLAY
       EXIT
       NOTIFY
       PRINT
       SPAWN
       USE

                                  3

 

 o  Initiation of SNA Service Point functions from DECmcc by issuing
    a text string which is a command to the Service Point Application
    (SPA), by means of the POLYCENTER SNA Manager EXECUTE command.

 o  Extensive online information similar to OpenVMS Help. Help infor-
    mation is provided for all entities, directives, and attributes.
    ASM or NetView users are able to access DECmcc's Help information
    from either system.
