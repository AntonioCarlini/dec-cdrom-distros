          PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER Framework, Version 1.4       SPD 32.46.05
                         (Formerly DECmcc Director)

          INTRODUCTION

          The POLYCENTER Framework is an entry-level POLYCENTER Network Manage-
          ment Family of Products management system for Digital Equipment Cor-
          poration's ADVANTAGE-NETWORKS[TM] (DECnet Phase IV, DECnet/OSI, and
          TCP/IP) environments. The Framework is an extensible platform on which
          other POLYCENTER products, third-party products, or user-developed
          management modules can be added.

          The POLYCENTER Framework includes an integrated command set, an
          object-oriented Management Information Repository, and graphic and
          command line user interfaces. It enables network operators/managers to
          perform basic monitoring and control tasks on network or system
          managed objects that support DECnet Phase IV NICE, DECnet/OSI CMIP,
          SNMP, or IEEE 802.2/Ethernet/MOP management protocols.

          Available on OpenVMS VAX and RISC ULTRIX platforms, the POLYCENTER
          Framework software is one in a family of POLYCENTER products based
          on Digital's Enterprise Management Architecture (EMA). For an
          overview EMA and POLYCENTER Framework refer to the POLYCENTER Network
          Management Services SPD 37.20.xx (also known as DECmcc Network
          Management Services).

          POLYCENTER Framework, Version 1.4                     SPD 32.46.05
          (Formerly DECmcc Director)

          DESCRIPTION

          The POLYCENTER Framework software provides an entry-level set of mon-
          itor and control functions for multi-protocol LAN, Extended LAN, and
          WAN networks. The POLYCENTER Framework is a competitive SNMP engine
          which provides a framework upon which developers can build management
          modules. The product allows the user to layer open, standards-based
          applications upon it. The POLYCENTER Framework offers a Motif Graph-
          ical User Interface (GUI) which is the standard, open user interface
          of choice.

          Consistent with the EMA Director Model, of which it is an implemen-
          tation, the POLYCENTER Framework consists of four major elements that
          comprise an extensible management system: Management Modules; an Ex-
          ecutive; an open Applications Program Interface (API); and a Manage-
          ment Information Repository (MIR).

          o  Management Modules provide services to users and one another. There
             are three types of Management Modules:

             -  Access Modules (AMs) provide protocol support for, and manage-
                ment information about, different classes of managed objects.

             -  Function Modules (FMs) provide services such as object regis-
                tration, statistics generation, fault detection, and notifica-
                tion to users and to one another.

             -  Presentation Modules (PMs) provide a consistent user interface
                for the direct manipulation of managed objects (through AMs) and
                user access to management operations (through FMs).

          o  The Executive provides system services that enable Management Mod-
             ules to be installed and used independently or in combination.

          o  The Applications Programming Interface (API) defines how Manage-
             ment Modules invoke each other's services. The POLYCENTER Frame-
             work API is open and documented to support Digital, third party,
             or user-developed modules.

          o  The Management Information Repository (MIR) provides a means to
             structure and store management information.

          POLYCENTER Framework, Version 1.4                     SPD 32.46.05
           (Formerly DECmcc Director)

          POLYCENTER Framework Access Modules (AMs)

          POLYCENTER Framework AMs provide access to network and system objects
          in Digital's ADVANTAGE-NETWORKS and other mixed, multivendor network
          environments that use the following management protocols: DECnet NICE,
          DECnet/OSI CMIP, SNMP and IEEE 802.2/Ethernet/MOP.

          o  The DECnet Phase IV AM enables users to manage DECnet Phase IV ob-
             jects such as nodes, circuits, lines, and adjacencies. With the 
             DECnet Phase IV AM, users can modify DECnet parameters, set charac-
             teristics, collect DECnet events, and poll for management data 
             such as counters or status.

          o  The DECnet/OSI CMIP AM provides management access to DECnet devices
             that use Digital's implementation of the standard Common Management
             Information Protocol (CMIP). This version of CMIP, implemented on
             DECnet/OSI devices, provides management operations and data gath-
             ering functions for DECnet/OSI networks, including the ability to 
             sink DECnet events to the POLYCENTER Framework.

          o  The TCP/IP SNMP AM includes support for the following Internet Ad-
             visory Board (IAB) Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) RFCs:
             1155, 1156, 1157, 1158, 1212, and 1213. This includes full MIB II
             support in addition to support for on-site enrollment of vendor-
             specific Enterprise MIBs including:

             -  A MIB translation utility that automatically checks the syntax
                of the ASN.1 Concise MIB definitions (providing error messages
                to help identify syntax problems), and translates the data for
                loading the information into the POLYCENTER Framework Manage-
                ment Information Repository (MIR).

                -  An event-logging sink for collecting SNMP generic traps (un-
                   solicited TCP/IP event messages) including: coldStart, warm-
                   Start, linkDown, linkUp, egpNeighborLoss, authentification-
                   Failure, and enterpriseSpecific.

                -  Ability to perform GET and SET operations on devices 
                   supported by SNMP agents.

          (Formerly DECmcc Director)

                -  ICMP ECHO_REQUEST (ping) support for verifying the reacha-
                   bility of an SNMP managed object at the IP level.

                Note: DEC TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS (UCX) is required for us-
                ing the TCP/IP SNMP AM on OpenVMS systems.

          o  The IEEE 802.3/Ethernet Station AM enables users to manage at the
             network interface level any 802.3/Ethernet LAN device that supports
             MOP REQID, MOP SYSID, MOP Counters, Ethernet V2 Loopback, 
             IEEE 802.2 XID, or IEEE 802.2 Test.

          o  Circuit AM works as a client of management protocol modules to pro-
             vide management of circuits connecting endpoints compliant with the
             Network Management Forum (NMF) definitions. Compliant endpoints in-
             clude DECnet Phase IV and DECnet OSI nodes and TCP/IP hosts. Ty-
             ing together circuit, line, link, and other endpoint data, this AM
             can gather status data and store reference information about sim-
             ple, point-to-point circuits or complex multi-channel circuits.

          o  The Script AM is a generic access module that executes a script (or
             command procedure) and propagates the output data back into POLY-
             CENTER Framework as individual attributes. Once integrated, these
             attributes can take advantage of the alarming, notification, and
             recording facilities of POLYCENTER Framework.

          o  The Script AM offers the following advantages:

             -  Allows integration of data into POLYCENTER Framework as 
                attributes whether from a Structured Query Language (SQL) 
                command, a system comman, or running a script on a remote 
                system.

             -  Allows integration of data from an executable for which source
                code is not available.

          POLYCENTER Framework, Version 1.4                     SPD 32.46.05
          (Formerly DECmcc Director)

          POLYCENTER Framework Function Modules (FMs)

          The POLYCENTER Framework provides FMs for registering and organizing
          managed objects regardless of the management protocol used or object
          type. This includes support for devices accessible through the Frame-
          work AMs, other Digital-developed AMs, or AMs developed and supported
          by third parties and users.

          o  The Registration FM is a generic FM that enables users to enter and
             manage data identifying each managed object in a network environ-
             ment. Such information includes object instance data such as net-
             work names and addresses, and reference information such as device
             location, software revision levels, and contact names.

          With the Registration FM, users have the option of selecting a local
          system-level repository or setting up a network-wide,
          globally-available naming service using Digital's Distributed Name
          Service (DECdns). With DECdns, users and applications can assign names
          to resources (such as nodes, bridges, files, domain names, etc.) and
          then use those resources without having to keep track of physical
          location or network address. The DECdns option also enables multiple
          POLYCENTER Frameworks to share the same view of managed objects.

          o  The Domain FM is a generic FM that enables users to assign managed
             objects into groups called domains. Domains are subsets of the man-
             aged object configuration that provide user-defined groups that can
             be based on equipment type (all DECnet nodes, all TCP/IP hosts, all
             LAN Bridges, etc.), geography (all objects within a LAN, building,
             campus, or subnet), personnel levels, or any other user-defined
             object group. Domains can contain or refer to other domains and can
             be hierarchical or overlapping. Individual managed objects can be
             contained within multiple domains.

          POLYCENTER Framework Presentation Modules (PMs)

          The POLYCENTER Framework includes two PMs. The Motif Graphical User
          Interface/Iconic Map PM provides a graphic interface with pull-down
          and pop-up menus and monitor windows that consistently present all
          managed objects and operations to the user. Consistent command
          syntax is provided by the Forms and Command Line PM.

          o  Capabilities specific to the Motif Graphical User Interface 
             presentation style include:

             -  Map windows that display the contents of a managed environment
                (for example, a domain) using icons to represent managed objects
                and their subordinate or child objects. Users can select icons
                representing managed objects and initiate management operations
                from a map window. Several map windows can be displayed at one
                time, each displaying different views of domains of a managed
                environment.

             -  A Navigation box and ViewPort window that enable users to view
                an entire network configuration map at one time. With the View-
                Port feature, users can navigate to and select a particular por-
                tion of the total network environment to display in detail in
                the Map window.

             -  Management windows that enable users to select, perform, and 
                view the results of management operations. Like map windows, 
                several different management windows can be displayed 
                simultaneously.

             -  Graph windows that enable users to select and display real-time
                or historical numeric attributes, such as counters, graphs or
                histograms.

             -  A Toolbox window and other customization features that provide
                users with the ability to create, modify, or delete map icons,
                connect lines, text, or other items in a map window. Users can
                create map icons, add geographic maps or other backdrops, and
                add customized icons to the Toolbox for retrieval and re-use.

          (Formerly DECmcc Director)

          o  Forms and Command Line PM provides character cell access to POLY-
             CENTER Framework function and access capabilities. The interface
             supports two modes: Command Line Mode and Forms Mode.

             -  The Command Line mode enables users to create names or mnemon-
                ics and use special symbols to reduce data entry and eliminate
                input errors. It supports command line recall and editing, ab-
                breviation, online help, symbol substitution, use of control key
                sequences, line continuation, and the typeahead function.

          Command Line Mode also supports the use of scripts to automate fre-
          quently used POLYCENTER Framework command sequences. Users can set up
          initialization files through the Command Line Mode for establishing
          defaults and executing startup directives. In addition, users can log
          any command to an output file for storage and review.

             -  The Forms mode provides the basic features of the Command Line
                mode in addition to a scroll feature that enables users to save
                up to 500 lines of output from management directives, scroll 
                through the saved output, and create new directives based on 
                previous input. The Forms Mode also allows printing and 
                logging of entries made to the output region.

          Both the Forms Mode and the Command Line Mode, as well as the Iconic
          Map interface, provide on-line, context-sensitive help.

          POLYCENTER Framework Extensibility

          In addition to providing basic monitoring and control functions as a
          standalone product, the POLYCENTER Framework software is an extensi-
          ble management platform to which other POLYCENTER software modules,
          optional packages, third party, or user-developed Management Modules
          can be added.

          The POLYCENTER Framework software includes several utilities that en-
          able on-site enrollment of POLYCENTER Option Packages and Management
          Modules. Documentation required for third party module enrollment must
          be supplied by the module developer.

          Optional packages include generic functional capabilities such as
          Alarming and Notification, and object specific functions and access
          modules that support device-specific management protocols.

          Third parties and users can develop software modules for POLYCENTER
          Network Management Family of Products to provide access to and man-
          agement functions for any manageable object. Software and documenta-
          tion for the development of integrated POLYCENTER modules are avail-
          able as part of the POLYCENTER Framework Developer's Toolkit. For more
          information about the Developer's Toolkit, refer to SPD 32.49.xx

          The POLYCENTER Framework management access and functions are also the
          basis for other POLYCENTER Network Management Family of products such
          as the POLYCENTER Network Manager 200 (formerly called DECmcc BMS) and
          the POLYCENTER Network Manager 400 (formerly called DECmcc EMS).

          (Formerly DECmcc Director)

          CLUSTER ENVIRONMENT

          This layered product is fully supported when installed on any valid
          and licensed VAXcluster* configuration without restrictions. The HARD-
          WARE REQUIREMENTS section details any special hardware required by
          this product.

          *  V5.x VAXcluster configurations are fully described in the VAXclus-
             ter Software Product Description (29.78.xx) and include CI, Eth-
             ernet, and Mixed Interconnect configurations.

          IMPORTANT INTEROPERABILITY INFORMATION FOR OPENVMS USERS ONLY

          Interoperability problems may occur when more than one product con-
          taining DECthreads is installed on a system. This occurs because some
          products overwrite the system version of DECthreads. If a product with
          a different version of DECthreads is installed after POLYCENTER Frame-
          work, problems may occur.

          POLYCENTER Framework V1.4 is linked with DECthreads V1.0-422. Later
          versions of DECthreads have a backwards compatible API. Consequently,
          no problem should result from having a more recent version of
          DECthreads on the system.

          Only SSB versions of DECthreads are supported.

          SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS FOR OPENVMS

          For Systems Using Terminals (no DECwindows Motif interface):

          o  OpenVMS VAX Operating System V5.5-2 to V6.1
