 PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER Console Manager, Version 1.6 SPD 42.90.04

 DESCRIPTION

 This SPD describes the following products - POLYCENTER[TM] Console Man-
 ager for OpenVMS[TM] VAX[TM] (formerly named VAXCluster[TM] Console
 System) and POLYCENTER Console Manager for OpenVMS Alpha and Digital
 UNIX[R] (formerly known as DEC[TM] OSF/1[R]).

 POLYCENTER Console Manager V1.5 for RISC ULTRIX[TM] will continue to
 be supported, but is not upgraded to V1.6. Please see the SPD for POLYCENTER
 Console Manager V1.5 (42.90.03) for the product description.

 POLYCENTER Console Manager (PCM) is a layered software product which
 enables a host system to manage, monitor and control client console
 devices. PCM can support up to 200 systems/devices of any platform type
 that sends ASCII data over RS232C direct, TELNET or LAT[TM] connec-
 tions which support XON /XOFF and I/O buffering. PCM also supports the
 use of a pseudo-terminal interface that provides a "soft" console for
 use with user-defined application programs.

 Examples of devices which can be managed are:

 o  DECsystem[TM] computers

 o  VAX systems or computers

 o  Third-party systems

 o  PrintServers

 o  LAN bridges

 o  Power distribution and air conditioning units

                               DIGITAL                     June 1995

                                                         AE-PRD4E-TE

 

 PCM provides a centralized point for system console services. PCM has
 built in security, restricting full console access to qualified users.
 The functionality includes:

 o  Shutting down or rebooting the serviced systems, as supported by
    hardware and/or operating system

 o  Running diagnostics

 o  Performing standalone backup procedures

 o  Viewing console output

 o  Reviewing historical console data

 o  Retrieving historical data for analysis

 o  Searching for console information

 o  Consolidation of data and activities between the PCM system and ser-
    viced hosts

 o  Scanning of incoming text for significant event information

 o  Event notification services

 o  Graphical iconic display of the serviced systems

 INSTALLATION

 PCM software can be installed on any Digital workstation system or server
 system as identified in this SPD. The devices serviced by PCM are con-
 nected to the PCM host platform via:

 o  Direct connection to the PCM host platform using a port of a se-
    rial line interface device (DHT)

 o  Host-initiated LAT connection to a terminal server which is acces-
    sible to the PCM host system

 o  Host-initiated TELNET connection to a terminal server which is ac-
    cessible to the PCM host system

                                  2

 

 o  A PCM host application program which takes its input from a pseudo-
    terminal port assigned to PCM

 SOFTWARE COMPONENTS

 PCM consists of the following components:

 o  Console Controller Processes - Manages groups of console lines. The
    processes log to disk data received on those lines, searching for
    the occurrence of user-defined text strings which form PCM events.
    Matches are dispatched to the event notification services process.
    The console controller processes also control the user connect and
    monitor functions.

 o  Central Control Coordinator (C3) Interface - An X Window System[TM]
    (X-Windows) OSF/Motif[R] interface that provides a logical view of
    the controlled systems. From this interface, system managers can
    monitor all console activities and respond to events detected on
    the console. Console events are reflected by the node icons in the
    display and direct the system manager to systems needing attention.
    Other interactive interfaces can also be activated from the cen-
    tral control coordinator Interface.

    Note: Only Color Graphic display terminals are supported.

 o  Full functionality with command line interface.

 o  Monitor Interface - Enables system managers to monitor the serviced
    systems. It monitors these systems by displaying multiple windows
    of information. System managers can connect the primary window to
    a single system or display log data in this window while monitor-
    ing other nodes. This interface is equivalent to a subset of the
    C3 interface functionality, but is provided on a character cell ter-
    minal device.

 o  Connect Interface - Enables system managers to connect to a man-
    aged system, making their terminal the dedicated console. Once con-
    nected, all keystrokes, except for the control keys defined to pro-
    vide the PCM exit, escape and break characters, are transmitted di-
    rectly to the console line of the node to which PCM is connected.

                                  3

 

    While connected to serviced system, the system manager sees nor-
    mal console behavior. The only exceptions to normal behavior are
    the configurable control characters reserved to enable the oper-
    ator to escape back to the PCM monitor, exit to the operating sys-
    tem shell or CLI, and send a break character to the managed sys-
    tem. This interface is equivalent to a subset of the C3 interface
    functionality, but is provided on a character cell terminal device.

    Note: More than one system manager can connect to the same serviced
    system. However, connections made after the first are placed into
    "Read-Only" mode because PCM is unable to execute commands on that
    console.

 o  Event Notification Services (ENS) - A suite of applications for in-
    terfacing with a wide range of communications media for PCM event
    notification. Event notification services provide a highly flex-
    ible mechanism for notifying system managers and other operations
    personnel of events occurring on the serviced systems. The events
    reported and the notification mechanism are highly customizable to
    fit the individual requirements of the system management domain.

 o  Callable Interface - An API which allows users to interface their
    own programs to the event notification services. Only programs writ-
    ten in C are supported.

 o  Configuration Editor - Allows operations staff to create and main-
    tain the configuration information.

 o  Configuration Database - Contains information about the users and
    hosts being serviced by PCM.

 o  Log Files - PCM maintains console, event and time stamp log files
    as the permanent historical records of console data from the ser-
    viced systems. These files may be spread over multiple disks for
    performance improvements.

 FEATURES

 o  Supports up to 200 console connections to any systems or devices
    that transmits ASCII data over a RS232 line which supports XON/XOFF
    and I/O buffering. The maximum supported console terminal speed is
    19.2K baud.

 o  All data received by PCM from connected systems or devices is logged
    to a disk file for the respective system or device, and is time stamped
    by PCM.

 o  Operators can connect to the console port of any system serviced
    by PCM from any terminal connected to the PCM host.

 o  PCM can control remote systems or devices in a LAN via LAT host-
    initiated connections over Ethernet using LAT terminal servers.

 o  PCM can control remote systems or devices in a WAN via TELNET con-
    nections over an internet, using terminal servers which support TELNET
    connections.

 o  Security is provided to allow the PCM Administrator to restrict user
    access.

 o  PCM detects events by scanning console text messages and compar-
    ing them with predefined literal strings or expressions contained
    in the configuration database.

 o  This graphical display uses color to indicate the severity of an
    event. It also allows the user to easily access a console by click-
    ing with a mouse to activate a PCM interface.

 o  Hierarchical display of groups of systems from the C3 interface.
    Each group is represented by an expandable icon which provides mon-
    itoring and managing at a higher level. Click on group icon to get
    system level detail.

 o  C3 interface supports use of Background bitmaps.

 o  Users are alerted of critical system messages by changing icons us-
    ing six ISO colors or other user-defined actions.

                                  5

 

 o  Facilities to archive old sections of the PCM log files to another
    disk.

 o  Conversion utility to aid upgrade from VCS Version 1.4 to PCM Ver-
    sion 1.6.

 o  Conversion utility to aid upgrade from PCM Version 1.0 to PCM Ver-
    sion 1.6.

 o  Facilities to provide loose integration with NetView[R] (on the Dig-
    ital UNIX platform only.)

 o  PCM can be run on more than one node in a VAXcluster. However, only
    one, cluster-wide, instance of the configuration editor can mod-
    ify the configuration database, even though two different instances
    of the database are being edited.

 Managed System Restrictions

 The PCM software cannot currently support a DECstation[TM] system as
 a managed system. This is due to a feature of the RISC ULTRIX X-Server
 which can not support the console device being directed to a physi-
 cal tty port on the system rather than the graphics device.

 Remote system halt requires hardware and/or operating system support
 to transmit a signal.

 Other Hardware Required

 A CD-ROM drive is required for all platforms.

 Disk Space Requirements

 The tables below summarize the use of disk space by each subset in-
 cluded with the PCM product on each of the supported platform types.

 The sizes quoted are approximate. The actual sizes may vary depend-
 ing on the installer's system environment, configuration, and soft-
 ware options.

 For OpenVMS VAX Systems:

 OpenVMS VAX systems store all the base system files in the disk vol-
 ume pointed to by the logical name CONSOLE$ROOT. The installer is al-
 lowed to define this logical name during the product installation.

 files, it does not take account of the requirements for the log and
 archive data collected by the PCM software.

 The sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
 system environment, configuration, and software options.

 Memory Requirements

 PCM performance is highly dependent upon the amount of physical mem-
 ory present. A minimum of 32 MB memory is required. This requirement
 will increase with the number of serviced systems and the number of
 concurrent X-Windows run from the PCM software.

 Terminal Server Requirements

 The following terminal servers are supported for providing LAT and TELNET
 PCM connections:

 Note: TELNET Break functionality is only supported on the DECserver[TM]
 90TL, DECserver 90M, DECserver 900 and the DECserver 700 with the Net-
 work Access Software. If using TELNET the terminal server must sup-
 port the Internet Working Group RFC 859 STATUS option in order to sup-
 port Line Lost Notification.
