 PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER Striping for OpenVMS VAX, Version 2.1 SPD
 31.66.02

 DESCRIPTION

 POLYCENTER Striping implements disk striping for the OpenVMS Operat-
 ing System. The product provides the ability for users to create one
 or more stripesets, each comprised of two or more physical disk drives
 and represented to the user application (and operating system) as a
 single pseudo-device. Stripesets must be composed of disks of a sin-
 gle type.

 Disk striping interleaves multiple disks to improve I/O performance
 in the same way that high-performance memory systems interleave mem-
 ory banks. In each case, data requests are decomposed and distributed
 to physical storage components that process those requests in paral-
 lel.

 There are three types of I/O performance problems that disk striping
 can help relieve. They are:

 1. Applications that require very high data transfer rates

 2. Systems in which static disk load balancing is ineffective

 3. Applications that are prohibited from distributing data across mul-
    tiple disks but need higher throughput than is available from a sin-
    gle disk

 The pseudo-device responds to all of the I/O operations defined for
 ordinary disk drives including physical, logical, and virtual I/O. As
 a result, the striping driver is transparent to all OpenVMS software
 other than diagnostics. However, a stripeset may not be an OpenVMS boot
 or dump device, and BACKUPs must be done on the pseudo-device, not on
 the member units.

 POLYCENTER Striping does not support MSCP serving of Stripesets to other
 nodes in a VMScluster. POLYCENTER Striping is not supported on Open-
 VMS AXP.

 A Digital Command Language (DCL) interface (CLI) is provided that en-
 ables the privileged user to define stripesets and to create and de-
 stroy the pseudo-devices that represent them. It also allows statis-
 tics and configuration information associated with the pseudo-devices
 to be listed.
