  pha and VAX) Software Product Descriptions are appended to the end of
  this SPD.

  DESCRIPTION

  Reliable Transaction Router (RTR) is fault tolerant transactional mes-
  saging middleware, used to implement large, distributed applications
  using client/server technology. This release of Reliable Transaction
  Router for OpenVMS enables enterprises to deploy distributed Reliable
  Transaction Router applications on OpenVMS Alpha and VAX systems.

  RTR Version 3.1D for OpenVMS Alpha and Reliable Transaction Router Ver-
  sion 3.1D for OpenVMS VAX are fully compatible and interoperable. RTR
  Version 3.1D for OpenVMS is interoperable with Reliable Transaction
  Router Version 3.1D for UNIX and with Reliable Transaction Router Ver-
  sion 3.1D for Windows[TM] 95 and Windows NT.

  RTR Version 3.1D for OpenVMS is interoperable with Reliable Transac-
  tion Router Version 2.2D ECO3 (or higher) for OpenVMS, subject to the
  restriction that within a given facility, all router and server nodes
  must be homogeneous with respect to Reliable Transaction Router soft-
  ware version (all Version 2.2D or all Version 3.1D).

  RTR provides an API for development of distributed applications us-
  ing languages such as C and C++, with optional all-or-nothing trans-
  action semantics as well as a message broadcasting capability. The API
  calls are also available from a command line interface. RTR for Open-
  VMS provides a reliable, transparent, dynamic message routing system

  that includes both a transactional and non-transactional message con-
  trol system. Reliable Transaction Router transaction management sup-
  ports two-phase commit of distributed transactions. In addition, Re-
  liable Transaction Router for OpenVMS implements RTR Version 2 API "wrap-
  per" routines that allow most existing RTR Version 2 based applica-
  tions to run without change.

  Reliable Transaction Router implements automatic software fault tol-
  erance and failure recovery on the OpenVMS operating system in multin-
  ode environments by adapting to many kinds of hardware (CPU), commu-
  nications, application software, and site failures. Automatic failover
  and recovery of service operates by exploiting redundant or alternate
  hardware and network links. If alternative hardware or network links
  are not available, RTR automatically continues service when the CPU
  or network link becomes available.

  Reliable Transaction Router applications are developed and deployed
  using a three-tier client/router/server software model. Client appli-
  cations call the Reliable Transaction Router "client" software tier,
  which passes messages to the "router" tier of the software. Messages
  and transactions are routed reliably and transparently, based on mes-
  sage content, to the appropriate process(es) in the "server" tier. Server
  applications typically execute transactions against a database and re-
  turn results back to clients.

  A single physical node may run one, two, or three tiers of the RTR client
  /router/server software model. Each of the three software tiers may
  consist of one or more nodes. The software model and its content-based
  routing present a "virtual", rather than physical, network to the ap-
  plication developer, providing a single view of a distributed client/server
  environment. This technique allows the application software to be in-
  dependent of physical hardware (CPU) location, network naming conven-
  tions, and communications protocol. This facilitates single-node de-
  velopment, and transparent scalability of applications to complex net-
  work configurations.

  Reliable Transaction Router[TM] Version 3.1D          SPD 51.04.06
  for OpenVMS[R]

  Reliable Transaction Router software fault tolerant features such as
  router failover and shadow-server processing provide continuous com-
  puting services with completion of in-progress transactions despite
  single or multiple points of failure in the distributed client/server
  environment. Call-out servers implement user authentication control,
  and concurrent servers provide dynamic message load balancing for high
  performance. The high performance transactional messaging is imple-
  mented as a full-duplex conversation with remote server procedures us-
  ing real-time flow control techniques. These features generally re-
  quire no special user application programming logic.

  The system management interface allows the creation, deletion, and mod-
  ification of virtual networks (facilities) within a network, and per-
  mits control of distributed Reliable Transaction Router processes from
  a single system within the distributed environment. The Reliable Trans-
  action Router system management interface is used to bind the phys-
  ical hardware (CPU and communications) to a virtual network namespace
  and is transparent to the applications software. A monitoring util-
  ity can be invoked to report application performance information on
  the local node.

  Reliable Transaction Router is independent of forms/window management
  systems and databases. Multiple databases and other resource managers
  (e.g.; flat-file systems) can be updated within the same distributed
  transaction.

  Reliable Transaction Router V3.1D for OpenVMS is intended for distributed
  applications that require continuous computing services and transac-
  tion integrity (e.g., trading/money dealing systems, transportation
  systems, telecommunications systems, and so on). Reliable Transaction
  Router can also be used for applications that require reliable mes-
  saging and fault tolerant application control over LANs, WANs or the
  Internet. Reliable Transaction Router provides the enabling technol-
  ogy for applications requiring fully distributed client/server mod-
  els.

  Reliable Transaction Router[TM] Version 3.1D          SPD 51.04.06
  for OpenVMS[R]

  Reliable Transaction Router for OpenVMS has two license types. The Back
  End license, which provides full client/router/server functionality,
  is required for nodes configured as routers or servers, and can also
  be used for nodes configured as clients. The Front End license pro-
  vides client functionality only, plus a single-node development and
  testing environment for RTR applications.

  Back End Features

  o  Provides transparent, content-based transaction routing for client/server
     applications.

  o  Provides nontransaction based routing (broadcasts) for multiple sub-
     scription domains within a virtual network.

  o  Allows user-defined partitioned data models (content-based rout-
     ing) for improved performance of user applications.

  o  Acts as a layer between the application requesters and servers, thus
     decoupling the end-to-end relationship normally required by user
     application control. This provides the application developer with
     a "single" system view of the programming environment.

  o  Ensures atomicity of transactions (all or nothing) by using a two-
     phase commit protocol for transactional message delivery among one
     or more application servers.

  o  Offers at-most-once semantics for valid transactions. This includes
     specially flagged transaction replay to a surviving application server,
     or a later instantiation of that server on the same or a differ-
     ent machine on the virtual network.

  o  DECdtm support is provided for use with resource managers supported
     by DECdtm. When the DECdtm option is invoked by the application pro-
     gram, the application programmer is not required to be aware of trans-
     action replays, since Reliable Transaction Router coordinates this
     directly through DECdtm and the participating resource managers.

  o  Supports multiple (concurrent) servers as well as multithreaded re-
     questers and servers.

  Reliable Transaction Router[TM] Version 3.1D          SPD 51.04.06
  for OpenVMS[R]

  o  Provides disaster protection against site failure by mirroring trans-
     actions in shadow-server environments. Automatic resynchronization
     of shadow pairs after recovery is supported.

  o  Maintains performance scaling over a wide range of configurations
     allowing easy horizontal expansion of both hardware systems and ap-
     plication software.

  o  Enables automatic failover/failback of application servers on mul-
     tiple backend systems while remaining transparent to client appli-
     cations executing on remote system(s). Reliable Transaction Router
     for OpenVMS can maintain application operation in many instances
     of single or multiple failure modes in a widely distributed soft-
     ware/hardware configuration.

  o  Includes system management utilities for online control of virtual
     networks from any workstation or terminal with the appropriate priv-
     ileges. Monitoring of statistics, software and hardware states, and
     clients and servers is provided on a local and remote node basis.

  o  Uses TCP/IP and/or DECnet (DECnet Phase IV or DECnet-Plus) as the
     underlying transport(s) for the virtual network.

  o  Includes an option to support RTR clients that use the ODBC inter-
     face.

  o  May be used with the the AltaVista Group Tunnel, supporting secure
     Internet communication for any RTR connection (client to router,
     router to backend).

  o  Supports anonymous clients, i.e. allows clients to be configured
     with wildcard node names.

  Front End Features

  o  Provides the necessary environment to run Reliable Transaction Router
     client applications under OpenVMS as part of a Reliable Transac-
     tion Router virtual network.

  o  Supports transactional and nontransactional (broadcast) messages.

  o  Supports automatic failover to another router in the event of a com-
     munication link or router failure.

  PRODUCT NAME:  Reliable Transaction Router Version 2.2D         SPD
  51.04.04                for OpenVMS Alpha

  DESCRIPTION

  Reliable Transaction Router Version 2.2D for OpenVMS Alpha can be li-
  censed for either full function operation or to work only as a client.
  It is a reliable, transparent message routing system that includes both
  a transactional and a nontransactional message control system. Reli-
  able Transaction Router implements automatic software fault tolerance
  and failure recovery on the OpenVMS Operating System by adapting to
  hardware (CPU), communications, and application software failures. Re-
  liable Transaction Router provides users with the ability to easily
  partition multiple application programs over DECnet local area net-
  works (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs). Ease of development fea-
  tures include both a Requester (Client)/Server design environment, with
  optional all-or-nothing transaction semantics, as well as a message
  broadcasting capability. Reliable Transaction Router implements vir-
  tual, rather than physical networks, which provide the application de-
  veloper with a "single view" of a distributed client/server environ-
  ment. This technique allows the application software to be indepen-
  dent of physical hardware (CPU) location, network naming conventions,
  and communications protocol.

  Reliable Transaction Router Version 2.2D for OpenVMS Alpha is fully
  compatible and interoperable with Reliable Transaction Router Version
  2.2D for OpenVMS VAX. Reliable Transaction Router Version 2.2D appli-
  cations developed on OpenVMS Alpha can be recompiled for execution on
  OpenVMS VAX. Reliable Transaction Router Version 2.2D applications can
  be deployed in networks and VMScluster systems containing a combina-
  tion of VAX and Alpha nodes. Reliable Transaction Router Version 2.2D


				   11





  Reliable Transaction Router Version 2.2D              SPD 51.04.04
  for OpenVMS Alpha

  for OpenVMS Alpha is also backward compatible with Reliable Transac-
  tion Router Version 2.x for OpenVMS Alpha (note: this does not apply
  to monitoring of remote nodes).

  Reliable Transaction Router is implemented by providing the program-
  mer with eight system services to develop distributed applications.
  This call interface conforms to the OpenVMS calling standard. The Reliable
  Transaction Router call interface functions are also made available
  at the Digital Command Language (DCL) level in both their synchronous
  and asynchronous forms.

  Reliable Transaction Router provides application software fault tol-
  erant features such as shadow-server processing, standby-server pro-
  cessing, and call-out servers to implement user authentication con-
  trol, as well as concurrent servers with dynamic message load balanc-
  ing for high performance. The high performance transactional messag-
  ing is implemented as a full-duplex, conversational remote procedure
  call (RPC) using real-time flow control techniques. These features gen-
  erally require no special user application programming logic.

  The System Management interface allows the dynamic creation, deletion,
  modification, and monitoring of multiple, independent virtual networks
  within a network. In addition, the monitoring utility can be invoked
  from any system, with suitable privileges, to gather and report dis-
  tributed application performance statistics. The Reliable Transaction
  Router System Management interface is used to bind the physical hard-
  ware (CPU and communications) to a virtual network namespace and is
  completely transparent to the application software. Several levels of
  physical and logical security can be controlled via the System Man-
  agement interface. Additional security is provided at runtime through
  the Reliable Transaction Router call interface.

  Reliable Transaction Router is both forms/window management systems
  and database independent. Application server features allow transaction-
  consistent access to Digital and non-Digital database products within
  the same networkwide distributed transaction.

  Reliable Transaction Router Version 2.2D              SPD 51.04.04
  for OpenVMS Alpha

  Reliable Transaction Router is primarily intended for production sys-
  tems in large distributed environments that require frontend forms in-
  dependence and backend server database independence (e.g., trading/money
  dealing systems, telecommunications systems, and so forth). Reliable
  Transaction Router can also be used in general distributed systems that
  require reliable messaging and fault tolerant application control over
  LANs and/or WANs. Reliable Transaction Router provides the enabling
  technology for applications requiring fully distributed client/server
  models rather than a distributed database model.

  Full Function Features

  o  Provides transparent, content-based transaction routing for client/server
     applications in a distributed system.

  o  Provides nontransaction based routing (broadcasts) for up to 32 sub-
     scription domains within a virtual network. Subscription is based
     on alphanumeric names within a flexible addressing scheme that in-
     cludes wildcarding.

  o  Allows user-defined partitioned data models (content-based rout-
     ing) for improved performance of user applications in a LAN and/or
     WAN.

  o  Acts as a layer between the application requesters and servers thus
     decoupling the end-to-end relationship normally required by user
     application control. This provides the application developer with
     a "single" system view of the programming environment over multi-
     ple hardware systems located on a LAN and/or WAN.

  o  Ensures atomicity of transactions (all or nothing) by using a two-
     phase commit protocol to guarantee conversational message deliv-
     ery among one or more application servers.

  o  Offers at-most-once semantics for valid transactions. This includes
     specially flagged transaction replay to a surviving application server,
     or a later instantiation of that server on the same or a differ-
     ent machine on the virtual network. In addition, DECdtm support is
     provided for use with resource managers supported by DECdtm. When


				   13





  Reliable Transaction Router Version 2.2D              SPD 51.04.04
  for OpenVMS Alpha

     the DECdtm option is invoked by the application program, the ap-
     plication programmer is not required to be aware of transaction re-
     plays, since Reliable Transaction Router coordinates this directly
     through DECdtm and the participating resource managers.

  o  Provides disaster protection and recovery (e.g., site failure) au-
     tomatically by mirroring transactions in shadow-server environments.

  o  Supports multiple (concurrent) servers as well as multithreaded re-
     questers and/or servers.

  o  Maintains near-linear performance scaling over a wide range of con-
     figurations allowing easy horizontal expansion of both hardware sys-
     tems and application software.

  o  Enables transparent and automatic failover/failback of application
     servers on multiple backend systems within a VMScluster while re-
     maining transparent to application requesters executing on remote
     frontend system(s). Reliable Transaction Router can maintain ap-
     plication operation in many instances of single or multiple fail-
     ure modes in a widely distributed software/hardware configuration.

  o  Includes system management utilities for online monitoring and sys-
     tem control of virtual networks from any workstation or terminal
     with the appropriate privileges. This feature includes the moni-
     toring of statistics, software and hardware states, requesters/servers,
     and system manager control of distributed Reliable Transaction Router
     applications.

  o  Provides a synchronous as well as asynchronous DCL interface to all
     Reliable Transaction Router system services. This feature is in-
     tended to facilitate application prototyping and debugging.

  o  Uses DECnet as the underlying transport for the virtual network.

  o  Supports the connection of a number of remote client products with
     the remote client handler feature. These remote client products im-
     plement a subset of the Reliable Transaction Router architecture.
     Connection to these types of clients is available using DECnet and
     /or TCP/IP. The remote client handler acts as a gateway between the
     remote client application and the application server on the vir-
     tual network.

  PRODUCT NAME:  Reliable Transaction Router Version 2.2D         SPD
  34.30.07                for OpenVMS VAX

  DESCRIPTION

  Reliable Transaction Router Version 2.2D for OpenVMS VAX can be li-
  censed for either full function operation or to work only as a client.
  It is a reliable, transparent message routing system that includes both
  a transactional and a nontransactional message control system. Reli-
  able Transaction Router implements automatic software fault tolerance
  and failure recovery on the OpenVMS operating system by adapting to
  hardware (CPU), communications, and application software failures. Re-
  liable Transaction Router provides users with the ability to easily
  partition multiple application programs over DECnet local area net-
  works (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs). Ease of development fea-
  tures include both a Requester (Client)/Server design environment, with
  optional all-or-nothing transaction semantics, as well as a message
  broadcasting capability. Reliable Transaction Router implements vir-
  tual, rather than physical networks, which provide the application de-
  veloper with a "single view" of a distributed client/server environ-
  ment. This technique allows the application software to be indepen-
  dent of physical hardware (CPU) location, network naming conventions,
  and communications protocol.

  Reliable Transaction Router Version 2.2D for OpenVMS VAX is fully com-
  patible and interoperable with Reliable Transaction Router Version 2.2D
  for OpenVMS Alpha. Reliable Transaction Router Version 2.2D applica-
  tions developed on OpenVMS VAX can be recompiled for execution on Open-
  VMS Alpha. Reliable Transaction Router Version 2.2D applications can
  be deployed in networks and VMScluster systems containing a combina-
  tion of Alpha and VAX nodes. Reliable Transaction Router Version 2.2D


				   21





  Reliable Transaction Router Version 2.2D              SPD 34.30.07
  for OpenVMS VAX

  for OpenVMS VAX is also backward compatible with previous Version 2.x
  releases of Reliable Transaction Router for OpenVMS VAX (note: this
  does not apply to monitoring of remote nodes).

  Reliable Transaction Router is implemented by providing the program-
  mer with eight system services to develop distributed applications.
  This call interface conforms to the OpenVMS calling standard. The Reliable
  Transaction Router call interface functions are also made available
  at the Digital Command Language (DCL) level in both their synchronous
  and asynchronous forms.

  Reliable Transaction Router provides application software fault tol-
  erant features such as shadow-server processing, standby-server pro-
  cessing, and call-out servers to implement user authentication con-
  trol, as well as concurrent servers with dynamic message load balanc-
  ing for high performance. The high performance transactional messag-
  ing is implemented as a full-duplex, conversational remote procedure
  call (RPC) using real-time flow control techniques. These features gen-
  erally require no special user application programming logic.

  The System Management interface allows the dynamic creation, deletion,
  modification, and monitoring of multiple, independent virtual networks
  within a network. In addition, the monitoring utility can be invoked
  from any system, with suitable privileges, to gather and report dis-
  tributed application performance statistics. The Reliable Transaction
  Router System Management interface is used to bind the physical hard-
  ware (CPU and communications) to a virtual network namespace and is
  completely transparent to the application software. Several levels of
  physical and logical security can be controlled via the System Man-
  agement interface. Additional security is provided at runtime through
  the Reliable Transaction Router call interface.

  Reliable Transaction Router is both forms/window management systems
  and database independent. Application server features allow transaction-
  consistent access to Digital and non-Digital database products within
  the same networkwide distributed transaction.

  Reliable Transaction Router Version 2.2D              SPD 34.30.07
  for OpenVMS VAX

  Reliable Transaction Router is primarily intended for production sys-
  tems in large distributed environments that require frontend forms in-
  dependence and backend server database independence (e.g., trading/money
  dealing systems, telecommunications systems, and so forth). Reliable
  Transaction Router can also be used in general distributed systems that
  require reliable messaging and fault tolerant application control over
  LANs and/or WANs. Reliable Transaction Router provides the enabling
  technology for applications requiring fully distributed client/server
  models rather than a distributed database model.

  Full Function Features

  o  Provides transparent, content-based transaction routing for client/server
     applications in a distributed system.

  o  Provides nontransaction based routing (broadcasts) for up to 32 sub-
     scription domains within a virtual network. Subscription is based
     on alphanumeric names within a flexible addressing scheme that in-
     cludes wildcarding.

  o  Allows user-defined partitioned data models (content-based rout-
     ing) for improved performance of user applications in a LAN and/or
     WAN.

  o  Acts as a layer between the application requesters and servers thus
     decoupling the end-to-end relationship normally required by user
     application control. This provides the application developer with
     a "single" system view of the programming environment over multi-
     ple hardware systems located on a LAN and/or WAN.

  o  Ensures atomicity of transactions (all or nothing) by using a two-
     phase commit protocol to guarantee conversational message deliv-
     ery among one or more application servers.

  o  Offers at-most-once semantics for valid transactions. This includes
     specially flagged transaction replay to a surviving application server,
     or a later instantiation of that server on the same or a differ-
     ent machine on the virtual network. In addition, DECdtm support is
     provided for use with resource managers supported by DECdtm. When


				   23





  Reliable Transaction Router Version 2.2D              SPD 34.30.07
  for OpenVMS VAX

     the DECdtm option is invoked by the application program, the ap-
     plication programmer is not required to be aware of transaction re-
     plays, since Reliable Transaction Router coordinates this directly
     through DECdtm and the participating resource managers.

  o  Provides disaster protection and recovery (e.g., site failure) au-
     tomatically by mirroring transactions in shadow-server environments.

  o  Supports multiple (concurrent) servers as well as multithreaded re-
     questers and/or servers.

  o  Maintains near-linear performance scaling over a wide range of con-
     figurations allowing easy horizontal expansion of both hardware sys-
     tems and application software.

  o  Enables transparent and automatic failover/failback of application
     servers on multiple backend systems within a VAXcluster while re-
     maining transparent to application requesters executing on remote
     frontend system(s). Reliable Transaction Router can maintain ap-
     plication operation in many instances of single or multiple fail-
     ure modes in a widely distributed software/hardware configuration.

  o  Includes system management utilities for online monitoring and sys-
     tem control of virtual networks from any workstation or terminal
     with the appropriate privileges. This feature includes the moni-
     toring of statistics, software and hardware states, requesters/servers,
     and system manager control of distributed Reliable Transaction Router
     applications.

  o  Provides a synchronous as well as asynchronous DCL interface to all
     Reliable Transaction Router system services. This feature is in-
     tended to facilitate application prototyping and debugging.

  o  Uses DECnet as the underlying transport for the virtual network.

  o  Supports the connection of a number of remote client products with
     the remote client handler feature. These remote client products im-
     plement a subset of the Reliable Transaction Router architecture.
     Connection to these types of clients is available using DECnet and
     /or TCP/IP. The remote client handler acts as a gateway between the
     remote client application and the application server on the vir-
     tual network.
