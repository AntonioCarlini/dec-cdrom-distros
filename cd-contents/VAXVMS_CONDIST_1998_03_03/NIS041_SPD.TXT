 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC Network Integration Server Software, Version 4.1 SPD
 36.05.11

 DESCRIPTION

 The DEC Network Integration Server (DECNIS) 500/600 product provides
 multiprotocol routing, bridging, and X.25 gateway services to host sys-
 tems on local area networks (LANs) connected to the DECNIS or to host
 systems connected to the DECNIS over wide area network (WAN) connec-
 tions. The DECNIS 500/600 software runs on any DECNIS 500 or 600 hard-
 ware unit.

 Overview

 The DECNIS software provides a routing service for:

 o  TCP/IP hosts

 o  DECnet Phase IV nodes

 o  DECnet/OSI Phase V nodes

 o  OSI-compatible systems

 o  Novell[R] NetWare[R] nodes

 o  AppleTalk[R] nodes

 Multiprotocol routing of IP, DECnet, and OSI is implemented using the
 Integrated Intermediate System to Intermediate System (Integrated IS-
 IS) routing protocol. Routing of IP is also supported using Open Short-
 est Path First (OSPF), Routing Information Protocol (RIP), Border Gate-
 way Protocol 4 (BGP-4), and Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP). Routing

                                                      September 1997

 of Novell NetWare and AppleTalk is implemented on the LAN using na-
 tive protocols and over the WAN using encapsulation within IP.

 The DECNIS software supports bridging of protocols that can not be routed.
 Both local bridging between LANs connected to the same DECNIS unit,
 and remote bridging between two DECNIS units connected over WAN links
 are supported.

 The DECNIS software provides X.25 gateway and relay services to con-
 nect end systems on a LAN to X.25 Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) con-
 nected directly to the DECNIS or connected over an X.25 Packet Switched
 Data Network (PSDN).

 The DECNIS software image is installed and configured on a host sys-
 tem called the load host. Once configured, the DECNIS software image
 and configuration file is loaded from the load host system to the tar-
 get DECNIS unit. When loaded, the DECNIS software image can be stored
 in internal non-volatile FLASH) memory so that subsequent software loads
 can be performed without the need for loading from a load host (flash
 loading). DECNIS systems equipped with the MPC-II (DNSAN-BH) and MPC-
 III (DNSBN-AH and DNSBN-BH) can store multiple configuration and im-
 age files in non-volatile (FLASH) memory.

 The DECNIS software is managed using the Network Command Language (NCL)
 command line interface which can be run on the DECNIS MPC-II (DNSAN-
 BH) or MPC-III (DNSBN-AH or DNSBN-BH) and accessed via the console,
 or from any Windows 95[R], Windows NT[R], DIGITAL UNIX[R] (formerly
 DEC OSF/1), OpenVMS for Alpha or OpenVMS for VAX system. Event log-
 ging and data tracing utilities are also available on DIGITAL UNIX,
 OpenVMS for Alpha and OpenVMS for VAX systems to assist problem solv-
 ing by logging network events and by tracing control messages received
 or sent by the DECNIS software.

 The DECNIS software can be managed from the POLYCENTER/NetView[R] net-
 work management platform or any system supporting the Simple Network
 Management Protocol (SNMP). SNMP sets, gets, and traps are supported
 where appropriate for MIB-II, Bridge MIB, FDDI MIB, DS3/E3 MIB and DIG-
 ITAL Vendor MIB variables.

 IP Routing

 The DECNIS software provides support for the following IP routing pro-
 tocols:

 o  OSPF V2 (RFC 1247)

 o  Integrated IS-IS (RFC 1195)

 o  RIP (RFC 1058)

 o  BGP-4 (RFC 1771)

 o  EGP (RFCs 827, 888, and 904)

 The DECNIS supports the OSPF Version 2 protocol as defined by RFC-1247.
 TOS 0 routing only is supported. The DECNIS OSPF implementation also
 supports the modifications and enhancements proposed in the replace-
 ment draft RFC, in particular the virtual link support enhancements
 and support for IP address super-netting. OSPF is configured using the
 DECNIS configuration utility and managed dynamically using the NCL com-
 mand line interface.

 The DECNIS supports the Integrated IS-IS routing protocol as defined
 in RFC 1195. When using Integrated IS-IS, the software supports equal-
 cost path splitting of IP data over up to four equal-cost paths. Vari-
 able, but contiguous, IP subnet masks are also supported. Integrated
 IS-IS is configured using the DECNIS configuration utility and man-
 aged dynamically using the NCL command line interface.

 The DECNIS supports Border Gateway Protocol Version 4 (BGP-4) as de-
 fined in RFC 1771 to provide inter-Autonomous System routing. An Au-
 tonomous System is a single administrative domain in which routers ex-
 change intra-domain routing information. BGP-4 allows the DECNIS to
 exchange intra-domain routes with other BGP-4 routers in other Autonomous
 Systems. The DECNIS is both a Border Router and BGP Speaker and im-
 plements both send and receive policies using Route Propagation and
 Filtering. BGP-4 is managed using the NCL command line interface. Note
 that an MPC-II (DNSAN-BH) or MPC-III (DNSBN-AH or DNSBN-BH) must be
 installed to run BGP-4.

                                  3

 

 The DECNIS also supports the RIP (RFC 1058) and EGP (RFCs 827, 888,
 and 904) routing protocols. Support for multiple instances of RIP and
 EGP is provided. In addition to IP routing protocols, the software also
 supports IP reachable addresses (static routes). RIP and EGP are con-
 figured using the DECNIS configuration utility and managed dynamically
 using the NCL command line interface. MIB-II variables as defined in
 RFC 1213 can also be managed using SNMP sets and gets.

 The DECNIS software supports Virtual Router Cluster (also known as IP
 Standby), a mechanism that greatly improves the resilience of IP back-
 bone networks. Enhancements have also been made to the Integrated IS-
 IS routing protocol algorithm to reduce the time taken to re-compute
 new routes. Virtual Router Cluster works in conjunction with Integrated
 IS-IS by providing fast IP router failover, should a router, its LAN
 connection, or one of its WAN circuits fail. In a typical network, failover
 is achieved in a way that is totally transparent to applications run-
 ning on IP host systems.

 The DECNIS software supports Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) as
 specified in the draft RFCs, "PIM Protocol Specification, January 1995"
 and "PIM Motivation and Architecture, January 1995". The DECNIS im-
 plementation of PIM implements Dense Mode only. PIM allows IP pack-
 ets to be forwarded to a defined group of hosts simultaneously. Each
 host in the multicast group must support RFC 1112, "Host Extensions
 for IP Multicasting". Note that an MPC-II (DNSAN-BH) or MPC-III (DNSBN-
 AH or DNSBN-BH) must be installed to run PIM.

 The DECNIS software supports full propagation of routes between dif-
 ferent routing protocols, for example between BGP-4, OSPF, Integrated
 IS-IS, RIP, and EGP. The propagation of IP routes learnt through one
 routing protocol into another protocol can be managed using the DEC-
 NIS configuration utility and the NCL command line interface. Controls
 can be added to include or exclude routes from single nodes, subnets,
 or collections of subnets. For RIP and EGP, controls can set up be-
 tween multiple instances of each protocol.

 The DECNIS software communicates with IP hosts and gateways on the lo-
 cal LAN using the ARP protocol (RFC 826). Proxy ARP (RFC 1027) is also
 supported. The DECNIS software also supports Path MTU Discovery tech-
 nique as specified in RFC 1191, and ICMP Router Discovery Messages as
 specified in RFC 1256 to allow IP hosts to distinguish the DECNIS as
 a router using ICMP messages and procedures. Using ICMP, the DECNIS
 periodically broadcasts ICMP Router Advertisement messages and responds
 to ICMP Router Solicitation messages from IP Hosts. All management pa-
 rameters defined in RFC 1256 are supported. DECNIS also supports an
 IP Helper function which allows IP routing to forward packets for par-
 ticular UDP ports to particular IP addresses. Popular UPD ports which
 can make use of this feature include TFTP (port 69), DNS (port 53),
 Time Service (port 37), NETBios Name Server (port 137) and NETBios Data-
 gram Server (port 138).

 The DECNIS software supports IP routing over CSMA/CD, FDDI, PPP, HDLC,
 Frame Relay, SMDS and ATM PVCs, or dynamically assigned X.25 circuits.
 The DECNIS supports IP routing over X.25 data links in accordance with
 RFC 877, and over PPP data links in accordance with RFC 1332. The DEC-
 NIS implements LLC encapsulation according to RFC 1483 to provide Clas-
 sical IP over ATM PVCs according to RFC 1577.

 IP Switching

 IP Switching is a method of forwarding IP packets over ATM connections.
 IP Switches and IP Switch Gateways identify and label IP packets which
 have the same characteristics and redirect this flow of IP packets onto
 an ATM virtual circuit. IP Switches provide direct switching of IP pack-
 ets over ATM virtual circuits in hardware, thus removing the per-router
 forwarding overhead and reducing latency.

 The DECNIS implements IP Switch Gateway functions to monitor, create
 and delete IP packet flows, associate flows with ATM virtual circuits,
 and pass information about flows to IP Switches.






                                  5

 

 The DECNIS uses normal IP protocols to communicate with other IP routers
 and IP hosts on the LAN and communicates with an IP Switch using IP
 Switching protocols defined in RFCs 1953 and 1954. RFC 1953 defines
 the types of IP packet flow; the DECNIS supports Type 2 flows based
 on source and destination address, time to live and version/Internet
 header length. RFC 1954 defines the flow labels that identify IP pack-
 ets as part of a flow. The flow label encodes the ATM VPI/VCI to which
 the flow will be redirected. IP Switching uses flow labels as repre-
 sentations of ATM connections and interprets the label as an ATM con-
 nection identifier.

 IP Switching is only supported on the DECNIS ATMcontroller 631. IP Switch-
 ing is configured using the clearVISN DECNIS Configurator utility and
 is managed dynamically using the NCL command line interface.

 DECnet Routing

 The DECNIS software implements both the DECnet Phase IV routing al-
 gorithm (routing vector) and the DECnet/OSI Phase V routing algorithm
 (link state routing). The DECNIS software supports both intra-area rout-
 ing (level 1) and inter-area routing (level 2). The DECNIS software
 can run either the Phase IV or Phase V routing algorithm in either com-
 bination at each level. When running the Phase V algorithms at either
 level 1 or level 2, the routing software is still able to handle traf-
 fic generated by DECnet Phase IV end systems and performs any neces-
 sary address and header conversions. DECnet routing is configured us-
 ing the DECNIS configuration utility and is managed using the NCL com-
 mand line interface.

 The DECNIS software supports path splitting over up to four routing
 circuits. If the cost between the router and the destination node is
 the same on multiple WAN circuits, then the DECNIS software splits the
 traffic across all the circuits.

 It is also possible to route IP traffic using RIP within a DECnet Phase
 IV only network by running RIP over the DECnet Phase IV level 1 or level
 2 links. An IS-IS routing circuit is required in order to handle IP
 traffic either within a level 1 area or between areas over a level 2
 link.

                                  6

 

 The DECNIS supports DECnet routing over CSMA/CD, FDDI, HDLC, DDCMP,
 and Frame Relay circuits, and over dynamically and statically assigned
 X.25 circuits. The DECNIS software also supports DECnet routing over
 PPP data links in accordance with RFC 1376.

 OSI Routing

 The DECNIS software fully implements the requirements of an OSI In-
 termediate System. The DECNIS software exchanges information about reach-
 ability of end systems using the OSI IS-IS Intra-Domain Routing Ex-
 change Protocol as specified in ISO/IEC 10589. OSI-compatible end sys-
 tems on the same LAN can exchange information with the DECNIS soft-
 ware and use the OSI End System to Intermediate System (ES-IS) Rout-
 ing Exchange Protocol as specified in ISO 9542. OSI routing is con-
 figured using the DECNIS configuration utility and is managed using
 the NCL command line interface.

 The DECNIS software supports OSI Connectionless Network Protocol (CLNP)
 routing as specified in ISO 8473, over CSMA/CD, FDDI, HDLC, Frame Re-
 lay and SMDS circuits, and over dynamically and statically assigned
 X.25 circuits. The DECNIS software also supports OSI CLNP routing over
 PPP data links in accordance with RFC 1377.

 Novell NetWare Routing

 The DECNIS software provides support of native Novell NetWare proto-
 cols over Ethernet and FDDI. Ethernet-II, 802.2, Encapsulated Ether-
 net (802.2 SNAP), and 802.3 RAW (Novell) data link formats are sup-
 ported. The following Novell NetWare protocols are supported:

 o  Novell NetWare IPX Forwarding

 o  Novell NetWare Routing Information Protocol (RIP)

 o  Novell NetWare Service Access Protocol (SAP)





                                  7

 

 Novell IPX is supported over wide area links using IP encapsulation
 according to RFC 1234. The DECNIS software also supports native IPX
 over leased line circuits using the PPP data link protocol (IPXWAN)
 according to RFC 1362 but does not support negotiated options. Nov-
 ell IPX routing is configured using the DECNIS configuration utility
 and is managed using the NCL command line interface.

 The DECNIS software has been tested and certified for use as a LAN router
 with Novell NetWare by Novell's test laboratory.

 AppleTalk Routing

 The DECNIS software provides support of native EtherTalk[R], the Ap-
 ple[R] specification for AppleTalk over Ethernet and FDDI. EtherTalk
 uses 802.2 SNAP data link format. The following AppleTalk protocols
 are supported:

 o  AppleTalk Phase-II Forwarding

 o  AppleTalk Phase-II EtherTalk

 o  AppleTalk Phase-II Address Resolution Protocol (AARP)

 o  AppleTalk Phase-II Routing Table Maintenance Protocol (RTMP)

 o  AppleTalk Phase-II Name Binding Protocol (NBP)

 o  AppleTalk Phase-II Zone Information Protocol (ZIP)

 o  AppleTalk Phase-II Echo Protocol (echo replies only)

 AppleTalk is supported over wide area links to other DECNIS systems
 using IP encapsulation. AppleTalk routing is configured using the DEC-
 NIS configuration utility and is managed using the NCL command line
 interface.





                                  8

 

 Bridging

 The DECNIS software supports local and remote bridging between LANs
 for protocols that cannot be routed (e.g., DIGITAL's LAT) or that are
 not supported by the DECNIS routing software (e.g., Xerox[R] XNS). The
 DECNIS software supports a maximum of 15 local or remote bridge port.

 DECnet, IP, OSI, IPX, and AppleTalk protocols are normally routed and
 cannot be bridged except in the following cases:

 o  DECnet, IP, IPX, and AppleTalk traffic can either be individually
    routed or bridged on a system wide basis. When routing is not en-
    abled for any one or more of these protocols, it will be bridged
    on all interfaces. Bridge filtering can be enabled for DECnet, IP,
    IPX, and AppleTalk on a port-by-port basis.

 o  OSI null-Internet frames will always be bridged over the Ethernet
    or FDDI interfaces.

 The DECNIS software implements the IEEE 802.1D Spanning Tree Proto-
 col and will interoperate with other DIGITAL or IEEE 802.1D-compliant
 bridges in the same extended LAN. When used as a local bridge, the DECNIS
 software forwards data packets from one LAN interface to another LAN
 interface. When bridging IP packets between FDDI and Ethernet inter-
 faces, frames larger than 1518 bytes will be fragmented before trans-
 mission over the Ethernet.

 Remote bridging is supported over PPP, HDLC, Frame Relay and ATM PVCs;
 it is not supported over X.25 and SMDS data links.

 Remote bridging is also supported between a DECNIS unit and NSC[R]/Vitalink[R]
 TransLAN[R] bridges using the Vitalink Control Protocol (VCP). Remote
 bridging is supported between a DECNIS 500/600 using the DEC WANcon-
 troller 622 network interface card and NSC/Vitalink TransLAN III, IV,
 320, 335 or 350 remote bridges or TransPATH 335 or 350 bridge/routers
 running either TransLAN V11.1.4 or TransPATH V11.2.5 software or later.

 When used with TransLAN bridges only one bridging link is supported
 at a time; load balancing over multiple links is not supported. The
 Vitalink DLS protocol is not supported by the DECNIS.

                                  9

 

 Tinygram compression is supported in accordance with RFC 1220 over PPP
 and VCP data links. This allows Ethernet and 802.3 frames which are
 padded with zeros, such as LAT frames, to be compressed over remote
 bridging links. Bridging over multiple remote hops is supported sub-
 ject to the Bridging Configuration Guidelines section below.

 Bridging is configured using the DECNIS configuration utility and is
 managed using the NCL command line interface. Bridge MIB variables as
 defined in RFC 1493 can also be managed using SNMP sets and gets. Bridge
 traffic, both local and remote, may be filtered based on a combina-
 tion of source or destination address and protocol type on a port-by-
 port basis.

 Bridging Configuration Guidelines

 When bridging over remote links, the performance of delay-sensitive
 protocols (such as LAT) cannot be guaranteed without careful consid-
 eration of the number of bridging hops and the speed of the lines con-
 necting the DECNIS units.

 DIGITAL warrants and supports the DECNIS product when used in extended
 LAN configurations subject to the following configuration restrictions:

 o  The minimum line speed supported for remote bridging between DEC-
    NIS units is 56 Kbits/s.

 o  Remote bridging is supported over PPP, HDLC, Frame Relay and ATM
    PVCs but is not supported over X.25 or SMDS circuits, or over satel-
    lite links.

 o  The maximum number of bridging ports supported by the DECNIS is 15.
    Consequently, the maximum number of remote bridging links that can
    be configured on the DECNIS is limited to 15.

 o  A maximum of seven local and remote bridges may be configured in
    series between any two communicating end stations. Each DECNIS unit,
    or any other IEEE 802.1D or LANbridge 100 compatible bridge, counts
    as one bridge towards this maximum configuration of seven bridges.

 o  Local Area VAXcluster (LAVC) is not supported over remote bridg-
    ing links.

                                 10

 

 o  PATHWORKS services may be restricted over remote bridging links;
    please refer to the relevant Software Product Descriptions for fur-
    ther information.

 o  When bridging between a DECNIS and NSC/Vitalink TransLAN, load bal-
    ancing and DLS are not supported.

 In addition to the above configuration restrictions, and, when using
 56 Kbits/s or 64 Kbits/s links between DECNIS units for remote bridg-
 ing of LAT, DIGITAL also recommends the following configuration guide-
 lines to ensure reliable operation:

 o  A maximum of two serial synchronous links should be used in the span-
    ning tree path between the LAT server and the LAT host.

 o  A minimum of 3 Kbits/s should be allocated for each active LAT ses-
    sion which needs to be supported simultaneously across the remote
    link. When using Tinygram compression, 2 Kbits/s should be allo-
    cated for each active LAT session.

 o  Links should be reserved for LAT and not shared with routed traf-
    fic such as DECnet, OSI, or IP. Also, other bridged traffic which
    may generate unnecessary traffic over the remote link should be fil-
    tered using the DECNIS Bridge Filtering facilities.

 Routing and Bridging over PPP

 The DECNIS software supports routing of IP, IPX, DECnet, and OSI pro-
 tocols over PPP datalinks as defined by RFCs 1332, 1334, 1362, 1376,
 1377 and RFC 1548. Bridging over PPP datalinks is also supported as
 defined by RFC 1220. PPP Authentication Protocol (PAP), PPP Header Com-
 pression and PPP SDU size negotiation are also supported.








                                 11

 

 Routing and Bridging over Frame Relay

 The DECNIS software supports connections over Frame Relay data links
 as specified in the Frame Relay Specification jointly developed by DIG-
 ITAL Equipment Corporation, StrataCom[R], Inc., Northern Telecom[R],
 and Cisco[R] Systems Inc.

 Multiple virtual circuits can be multiplexed over a single Frame Re-
 lay link using the Data Link Control Identifier (DLCI) field of the
 Frame Relay LAPD header. For details of the Frame Relay options im-
 plemented, refer to the CONFORMANCE TO STANDARDS section of this SPD.

 Routing of IP, DECnet, and OSI protocols, and bridging of other pro-
 tocols is supported over Frame Relay PVCs as defined in RFC 1490 us-
 ing point-to-point encapsulation only, or by using PPP encapsulation
 within the Frame Relay frame. IPX and AppleTalk can also be routed over
 Frame Relay within IP. The DECNIS Frame Relay implementation supports
 both the LMI and ANSI-D switch control procedures.

 Frame Relay is only supported on the DEC WANcontroller 622, DEC WAN-
 controller 622/HS, and DECNIS HSSIcontroller 641 network interface cards.
 A maximum of 32 Frame Relay PVCs can be configured per physical in-
 terface with an overall limit of 128 per DECNIS system. A maximum of
 15 Frame Relay PVCs can be configured for remote bridging per DECNIS
 system.

 The DECNIS supports the following Frame Relay features:

 o  Rate control and dynamic BECN allows the DECNIS to throttle back
    to the Committed Information Rate (CIR) on a per PVC basis on no-
    tification of congestion by the network. The DECNIS can throttle
    back to the CIR or below the CIR until notified by the network that
    the congestion has cleared. Management options also allow the DEC-
    NIS to limit throughput to or below the CIR on a continuous basis
    and not to burst beyond the CIR. This helps to control network op-
    erating costs as bursting beyond the CIR often means additional cost.




                                 12

 

 o  Frame Relay counters allow network managers to monitor throughput
    on a per PVC basis so that they can monitor the overall performance
    of the network. Counters can also be used to help locate problems
    in the network and to check billing for network usage by the ser-
    vice provider.

 o  Queuing allows packet prioritization and filtering to be set up on
    a per interface basis to ensure time critical traffic is priori-
    tize over other traffic, to help make optimum use of available band-
    width, and to avoid unnecessary traffic being sent over the net-
    work.

 o  DE (Discard Eligibility) allows the DECNIS to indicate to the net-
    work that certain packets can be discarded in the event of conges-
    tion. The DECNIS allows the DE bit to be set on a per queue basis,
    so that packets in low priority queues will be discarded first in
    the event of network congestion.

 Routing over X.25

 The DECNIS software supports routing over statically and dynamically
 assigned X.25 virtual circuits. Static X.25 circuits are established
 when the routing circuit is enabled and remain established until the
 routing circuit is disabled. Dynamically assigned X.25 circuits are
 established only when there is information to send over the routing
 circuit. They are disconnected when there is no further information
 to send.

 The DECNIS X.25 software supports routing over either Permanent Vir-
 tual Circuits (PVCs) or Switched Virtual Circuits (SVCs). Each X.25
 virtual circuit can run only one routing protocol. However, differ-
 ent routing protocols can be run over separate virtual circuits on the
 same X.25 DTE connection.







                                 13

 

 Routing over Switched Multi-megabit Data Service (SMDS)

 Switched Multi-megabit Data Service is a connectionless, cell-switched
 data transport service and is available at speeds between 56 Kbits/s
 and 45 Mbits/s. The DECNIS software implements the SMDS Date Exchange
 Interface (DXI) according to SIG-TS-001/1991 SMDS Data Exchange In-
 terface Protocol Revision 3.2 and the Bellcore specification using SIP
 3 PDUs of up to 4500 bytes with DXI CRC and with 6 octet SMDS addresses.
 An external SMDS CSU/DSU is required to provide SIP 2 and SIP 1 func-
 tions.

 Using the WANcontroller 622/HS, the following SMDS Classes of Service
 are supported:

 o  1.473 Mbits/s using T1 or E1 access lines

 o  4 Mbits/s, 10 Mbits/s, or 16 Mbits/s using T3 or E3 access lines

 Routing of IP, DECnet, and OSI protocols is supported over SMDS us-
 ing OSPF, Integrated IS-IS and RIP routing protocols. IPX and AppleTalk
 can also be routed over SMDS using encapsulation within IP.

 Routing and Bridging over ATM

 The DECNIS software supports ATM AAL5 and multiple PVC connections as
 specified in the ATM Forum Public and Private UNI V3.0.

 Routing of IP, DECnet, and OSI protocols, and bridging of other pro-
 tocols, is supported over ATM PVCs using LLC encapsulation within ATM
 cells as defined in RFC 1483. IPX and AppleTalk can also be routed over
 ATM using encapsulation within IP. The DECNIS also supports Inverse
 ARP (RFC 1293) and Classical IP as defined in RFC 1577.

 ATM is only supported on the DECNIS ATMcontroller 631 network inter-
 face card. A maximum of 127 ATM PVCs can be configured per DECNIS sys-
 tem. A maximum of 15 ATM PVCs can be configured for remote bridging
 per DECNIS system. DIGITAL's FLOWmaster[R] credit based rate limit-
 ing is supported by the ATMcontroller 631 for interoperability with
 the GIGAswitch/ATM.

                                 14

 

 Note that an MPC-II (DNSAN-BH) or MPC-III (DNSBN-AH or DNSBN-BH) must
 be installed when using the DECNIS ATMcontroller 631.

 Backup Circuits

 The DECNIS supports a backup circuit feature which detects the fail-
 ure of a primary routing circuit and establish an alternative or backup
 routing circuit for the duration of the failure. Primary routing cir-
 cuits can be PPP, HDLC or DDCMP leased line circuits while secondary
 circuits can be leased line or switched public network services such
 as dialup, ISDN or X.25. Invoke and revoke timers can be set up to con-
 trol the time to wait before enabling or disabling the backup circuit.

 A primary circuit and a backup circuit can be grouped so that one backup
 circuit can be shared between a number of primary circuits to reduce
 costs. For example, an ISDN connection can be used as a backup cir-
 cuit for a number of leased line primary circuits. Backup circuits can
 also be cascaded such that a backup circuit of one group can be a pri-
 mary circuit of another.

 Packet Prioritization

 The DECNIS software supports packet prioritization on the LANcontroller
 601/602 and WANcontroller 614/618/622/622HS network interface cards
 so that different protocols or traffic types can be given the differ-
 ent priorities over LAN and WAN links. Traffic can be prioritized based
 on protocol type, for example IP, IPX, DECnet, OSI or bridge traffic.
 Within IP, traffic can be additionally prioritized based on TCP/UDP
 port number, protocol type or Type of Service. Bridge traffic can also
 be prioritized based on SAP value, PID value or Ethernet type.

 The DECNIS supports up to eight levels of priority. Packets can be as-
 signed to priority groups which are then assigned to one of the eight
 queues. The queues are then processed in order such that high prior-
 ity packets are always transmitted first. The maximum queue length can
 be set for each queue to ensure that packets in each queue are pro-
 cessed appropriately.



                                 15

 

 A simple packet filtering mechanism for out bound WAN traffic can be
 implemented by assigning packets to be filtered to a specific queue
 whose queue length has been set to zero. Packet and byte counters al-
 low the number of packets transmitted and discarded to be monitored
 on a per interface basis.

 Note that the DECNIS automatically prioritizes routing and bridge con-
 trol traffic to ensure that network stability is maintained at all times.

 Pattern Matching

 An extension to the packet prioritization mechanism allows priority
 packets to be further classified by packet pattern matching. Specific
 bit sequences can be matched with masks and on the basis of a match,
 packets can be assigned to different priority queues. For example, LAT
 service groups can be filtered to allow only certain services to be
 advertised across the network.

 IP Packet Filtering

 The DECNIS supports IP packet filtering at the routing level to con-
 trol access between IP hosts and to control bandwidth utilization on
 the network. Packet filtering can be set up on each interface based
 on:

 o  Protocol type such as TCP, UDP, ICMP, IP

 o  Source/destination address and mask

 o  Source/destination port and mask

 o  IP protocol number

 o  ICMP message type and mask

 Combinations of filter characteristics can be set up to describe the
 packet types to filter. The DECNIS only filters on outgoing circuits
 which means that the DECNIS will receive all packets before applying
 packet filters.

                                 16

 

 Secure Connection Firewall

 The Secure Connection Firewall (also known as the Secure Connection
 Manager) provides filtering of network connect requests to deny or per-
 mit access to network resources. The Secure Connection Firewall im-
 plements access control by creating logical barriers around one or more
 systems or groups of systems called network domains.

 Nodes, circuits, applications and users can be combined into groups
 that share the same security requirements and access rules can be set
 up to apply to each group. Access rules can be based on parameters such
 as time of day, circuit name, user and host name, source and desti-
 nation address, IP port and protocol, DECnet node and object, OSI node
 and application.

 The Secure Connection Firewall is set up using the clearVISN DECNIS
 Configurator utility.

 Data Compression

 The DECNIS supports data compression on the DEC WANcontroller W622 and
 W622/HS network interface cards. The data compression uses a propri-
 etary algorithm operating over HDLC data links and only interoperates
 with other DECNIS. The algorithm provides a typical data compression
 ratio of 1.7:1 depending on the type of data.

 The DECNIS only supports data compression of routed (i.e. sequenced)
 traffic across HDLC data links. However, bridged (i.e. unsequenced)
 traffic can also be supported over HDLC links that are running data
 compression for routed traffic. Packet prioritization, pattern match
 filtering and IP packet filtering can also be implemented over HDLC
 links that are running data compression.

 Since data compression is implemented in software on the DEC WANcon-
 troller 622 and 622/HS network interface cards, the maximum line speeds
 that can be supported while data compression is enabled is signifi-
 cantly lower than the maximum speed supported without data compres-
 sion. The maximum line speed at which data compression can be run re-
 liably is 384 Kbits/s per interface for the DEC WANcontroller 622/HS
 and 128 Kbits/s per interface for the DEC WANcontroller 622.

                                 17

 

 X.25 Gateway

 When operating as an X.25 Gateway, the DECNIS software transmits and
 receives X.25 packets to and from any of the following systems:

 o  Any DIGITAL systems which support the DNA Gateway Access Protocol
    (GAP)

 o  Any systems located on the same LAN which support the ISO Logical
    Link Control 2 (LLC2) protocol (as described in ISO 8881)

 o  Any X.25 DTE accessible over an X.25 Public Switched Data Network
    (PSDN) connected to the DECNIS

 o  Any X.25 DTE connected directly to a port of the DECNIS operating
    in X.25 DCE mode (ISO 8208 point-to-point mode)

 o  Any X.25 DTE connected to any other DECNIS accessible over the DEC-
    net/OSI routing network

 When providing wide area access to an X.25 PSDN for end systems on the
 LAN which use LLC2, the DECNIS software fully implements the recom-
 mendations in ISO Technical Report 10029 as a CONS LAN/WAN relay.

 X.25 packets can be relayed locally between any X.25 DTE attached to
 the DECNIS hardware unit and any other similarly attached X.25 DTE or
 any X.25 system connected to the same LAN. Additionally, X.25 pack-
 ets can be relayed to remote X.25 DTEs accessible to other DECNIS or
 DEC X.25 gateway 100/500 servers over a DECnet/OSI routing network.
 The software does not support the relaying of X.25 packets generated
 from an X.25 DTE connected to one X.25 PSDN to an X.25 DTE connected
 to another X.25 PSDN.

 X.25 DTE and Virtual Circuit Support

 The DECNIS allows multiple connections to one or more X.25 PSDNs and
 can share outgoing calls between all of the DTEs connected to an X.25
 PSDN. Both Switched Virtual Circuits (SVCs) and Permanent Virtual Cir-
 cuits (PVCs)are supported. The X.25 Networks section of this SPD pro-
 vides details of the public X.25 PSDNs and X.25 (1988) optional fa-
 cilities supported by the DECNIS X.25 software.

                                 18

 

 The number of X.25 DTEs and virtual circuits that the DECNIS X.25 soft-
 ware supports depends on the type of management processor installed.

 Notes:

 o  The actual number of X.25 connections that the DECNIS can sustain
    at any time may be less than indicated and depends on such factors
    as the rate at which calls are set up and cleared down, the level
    of traffic, and the ratio of routing to gateway and relay traffic.

 o  For routing over X.25 and X.25 gateway (GAP), one virtual circuit
    is established per X.25 connection. For X.25 relay (LLC2), two vir-
    tual circuits are established per X.25 connection, one incoming vir-
    tual circuit and one outgoing virtual circuit.





                                 19

 

 X.25 Accounting and Security

 The following accounting information is provided by the DECNIS X.25
 Gateway software:

 o  Logging of virtual circuit accounting when calls are cleared

 o  Logging of accounting records to a designated Event Logging sink

 o  Logging to multiple sinks for reliability

 The following security mechanisms are supported by the DECNIS X.25 Gate-
 way software:

 o  Inbound and outbound calls can be controlled on the basis of the
    remote DTE, the application, and, if applicable, the X.25 Access
    node

 o  Access to accounting sink management is restricted to authorized
    users

 o  Access to accounting source management is restricted to authorized
    users

 Installation and Configuration

 The DECNIS software image is installed on a host system called the load
 host. The following load hosts systems are supported:

 o  PCs running Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows NT

 o  Alpha systems running DIGITAL UNIX

 o  Alpha systems running OpenVMS

 o  VAX systems running OpenVMS

 Once installed on the load host, the DECNIS software is configured us-
 ing the host configuration and DECNIS configuration utilities supplied
 with the product. The host configuration utility allows the DECNIS units
 to be defined in the load host's network node database. It also al-
 lows the appropriate system image and unique configuration file for
 each DECNIS unit to be defined in the load host's network node database.

                                 20

 

 The DECNIS configuration is used to create the unique configuration
 file for each DECNIS unit.

 The DECNIS software image and individual configuration files are loaded
 from the load host system to each target DECNIS unit using BOOTP or
 DIGITAL's Maintenance Operation Protocol (MOP). Loading can be either
 locally on the same LAN or extended LAN (downline loading), or over
 an HDLC or PPP link from a local DECNIS unit connected directly to the
 target DECNIS unit (agent loading).

 When using agent loading, the DECNIS system performing the loading op-
 eration must be configured to copy the required files from a suitable
 load host. Agent loading of DECNIS units may also be daisy-chained over
 a number of HDLC links provided that the first DECNIS in the chain is
 on the same LAN as the load host and each member of the chain is a DEC-
 NIS unit.

 The minimum requirement is for one load host. However, the DECNIS soft-
 ware image and configuration files can be copied to any number of re-
 mote load hosts within the network for local loading. The DECNIS soft-
 ware allows BOOTP load requests broadcast over a LAN to be forwarded
 to a BOOTP server located anywhere within the network. This helps to
 protect against loss of service if the main load host is unavailable
 or unable to load the system for any other reason.

 When loaded, the DECNIS software image and, optionally, the config-
 uration file, can be stored in the DECNIS internal non-volatile (FLASH)
 memory so that subsequent software loads can be performed without the
 need to load from a load host (flash loading). The FLASH memory can
 be updated dynamically while the DECNIS system is running without dis-
 rupting network service. The FLASH memory on the MPC-III (DNSBN-AH or
 DNSBN-BH) can also be partioned into separate areas for system images
 and configuration files to provide greater flexibility.







                                 21

 

 clearVISN DECNIS Configurator

 The clearVISN DECNIS Configurator is a Windows 95 and Windows NT graph-
 ical utility for creating and modifying DECNIS configuration files.
 The utility configures system, routing and data link paramaters as well
 as the Secure Connection Firewall and Route Propagation and Filter-
 ing. DECNIS configurations can be generated live or generated offline
 for loading at a convenient time. The clearVISN DECNIS Configurator
 also loads the configuration files using BOOTP and TFTP. A clearVISN
 BOOTP/TFTP Server utility is also included with the clearVISN DECNIS
 Configurator.

 A scripting feature allows extra DECNIS configuration commands to be
 edited and then loaded as part of the main configuration. The script-
 ing feature allows configuration of functions that are not supported
 by the clearVISN DECNIS Configurator.

 An NCL command line interface utility is also provided which sets up
 a Telnet session to the DECNIS console. This allows the DECNIS to be
 managed dynamically using the NCL command line interface.

 The clearVISN DECNIS Configurator is included with the DECNIS Windows
 95/NT software kit and is also offered as part of the clearVISN prod-
 uct set.

 Updates to the clearVISN DECNIS Configurator are available from time
 to time for down load from the clearVISN DECNIS Configurator Home Page
 on the World Wide Web:

 http://www.networks.digital.com/dr/cdc/

 Management

 The DECNIS software conforms to both the IETF Structure of Management
 Information and to DIGITAL's DECnet Network Architecture (DNA). Man-
 agement of the DECNIS is supported using either the Simple Network Man-
 agement Protocol (SNMP) or DIGITAL's implementation of the Control Man-
 agement Information Protocol (CMIP).


                                 22

 

 The DECNIS V4.1 software supports two types of management processor
 card:

 o  MPC-II (DNSAN-BH) - this card has 16 MB of dynamic memory and 4 MB
    of non-volatile (FLASH) memory.

 o  MPC-III (DNSBN-AH or DNSBN-BH) - this card has either 16 or 32 MB
    of dynamic memory and 4 or 8 MB of non-volatile (FLASH) memory.

 Both the MPC-II and MPC-III have a console port for out-of-band man-
 agement. The console port provides VT100 terminal support and full mo-
 dem control for remote connection over a dial up line. The MPC-II and
 MPC-III also implement TCP and Telnet so that the DECNIS can be man-
 aged in an IP only environment. Telnet server only is implemented to
 prevent the local DECNIS console from being used to set up a remote
 connection to another DECNIS or IP host.

 Note that the DECNIS V4.1 software also supports the MPC-I (DNSAN-AH)
 which has 8 MB of dynamic memory and 2 MB of non-volatile (FLASH) mem-
 ory. However, some DECNIS V4.1 software features are not supported on
 the MPC-I. Refer to the "Hardware Requirements" section for further
 details.

 The DECNIS software is managed dynamically using the Network Command
 Language (NCL) command line interface. The MPC-II (DNSAN-BH) and MPC-
 III (DNSBN-AH or DNSBN-BH) support on-board NCL for dynamic out-of-
 band management of the local DECNIS router and remote DECNIS routers
 from the console interface. NCL can also be run on any Windows 95/NT
 PC, DIGITAL UNIX, OpenVMS for Alpha or OpenVMS for VAX system to pro-
 vide in-band management of DECNIS systems over the network.

 Dynamic management tasks that can be performed using NCL include:

 o  Management of connections, for example, set up the data links, en-
    able and disable circuits

 o  Monitoring of network traffic, for example, enable event logging,
    display counters


                                 23

 

 o  Problem solving, for example, test circuit availability, perform
    loopback tests

 Event logging and data tracing utilities are also available on DIG-
 ITAL UNIX, OpenVMS for Alpha, or OpenVMS for VAX systems to assist prob-
 lem solving by logging network events and by tracing control messages
 received or sent by the DECNIS software.

 The DECNIS software can be managed dynamically from any system sup-
 porting the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). SNMP sets and
 gets are supported where appropriate for the variables defined in the
 following Management Information Bases (MIBs):

 o  DIGITAL Vendor MIB

 o  MIB-II (RFC 1213)

 o  Bridge MIB (RFC 1493)

 o  FDDI MIB (RFC 1285)

 o  DS3/E3 MIB (RFC 1407)

 MIB-II interface support is provided for CSMA/CD, FDDI, PPP, HDLC, VCP,
 LAPB, DDCMP and ATM AAL5 data links. SNMP traps are also supported with
 the ability to send traps to up to four destinations. SNMP can only
 be used to manage MIB variables when IP routing is enabled.

 The DECNIS responds to, but can not source, IP Pings and OSI Echo re-
 quests. The DECNIS can also forward echo requests and responses.

 clearVISN Intranet Manager

 The clearVISN Intranet Manager is an SNMP management utility that man-
 ages DECNIS, RouteAbout and DECswitch routers, as well as other ven-
 dors' routers. The application also supports other routers and switches
 that implement MIB-II and other standard MIBs.



                                 24

 

 For DECNIS, the clearVISN Intranet Manager provides fault detection,
 path tracing between selected routers, event generation and report-
 ing, and performance monitoring. The performance monitoring includes
 both real time and historical views of data grouped by routers or in-
 terfaces.

 The clearVISN Intranet Manager is available as part of the clearVISN
 product set.

 DIGITAL Trace Facility

 The DIGITAL Trace Facility allows data to be monitored as it flows through
 the software layers and modules of the DECNIS. The DTF application col-
 lects data from trace points embedded in the router software to help
 troubleshooting and problem analysis.

 Network Sizing

 The DECNIS software allows memory to be allocated to statically as-
 signed network parameters to suit different network requirements. This
 memory is allocated during configuration. The memory left over can be
 allocated during operation to dynamically assigned network parameters
 when needed. This feature is called Dynamic Database Sizing.

 The DECNIS configuration utility checks to ensure that memory is not
 over allocated and also indicates how much memory is left over for dy-
 namically assigned parameters. When the DECNIS is running, event mes-
 sages are generated if any of these parameters are approached or ex-
 ceeded. Full information about which network parameters can be set and
 how much memory is used is included in the DECNIS documentation. Please
 consult your local DIGITAL office for more details and for assistance
 with network sizing and planning.








                                 25

 

 DECNIS Hardware

 The DECNIS software requires either a DECNIS 500 or DECNIS 600 series
 hardware unit and one or more network interface cards. The DECNIS 500
 supports up to two network interface cards and the DECNIS 600 supports
 up to seven network interface cards.

 The following LAN interface cards occupy a single slot of the DECNIS

    cards.

 Physical Line Support

 The DECNIS WAN network interface cards support the following electri-
 cal interfaces:

 o  DEC WANcontroller 614

    -  V.28 (EIA-RS232-D/EIA-RS232-C)

    -  V.36/V.11 (RS449/RS422)

    -  V.35

 A multi-standard distribution panel with separate adapter cables pro-
 vides the necessary interchange circuits for each synchronous port,
 allowing different interface standards to be supported on each port.

 o  DEC WANcontroller 618

    -  V.28 (EIA-RS232-D/EIA-RS232-C)

    -  V.36/V.11 (RS449/RS422)

    -  V.35

 Separate distribution panels with appropriate interface cables pro-
 vide the necessary interchange circuits for each synchronous port al-
 lowing the same interface standard to be supported on each port. An
 extra adapter cable is used with the RS422/V.11 distribution panel to
 connect to British Telecom Kilostream services.

 o  DEC WANcontroller 622 and 622/HS:

    -  V.36/V.11 (RS449/RS422)

    -  V.35

    -  X.21 (leased line services)

    -  British Telecom Kilostream and Megastream

                                 28

 

 Where appropriate, separate adapter cables provide the necessary in-
 terchange circuits for each port. An X.21 adapter cable is used to con-
 nect to British Telecom Kilostream and Megastream services.

 Reflected clock signals may need to be set up when using the WANcon-
 troller 622/HS to connect to DSU/CSUs at line speeds greater than 6
 Mbits/s. This depends on the interface and the length of cable used.

 o  DECNIS HSSIcontroller 641:

    -  EIA-613 (HSSI)

 A suitable DSU/CSU with an EIA-613 (HSSI) interface is required to con-
 nect to the appropriate network service.

 The synchronous ports on each network interface cards provide only the
 electrical interface of a DTE rather than a DCE, and do not provide
 clock signals. An external clock source (such as a modem or DSU/CSU)
 is required for each synchronous connection.

 Table 3 shows the adapter cables required for each of the electrical
 interface types.

 Notes:

 1. This should be ordered as part BS23V-02, which contains the BC23V-
    02 adapter cable to provide the V.28/V.24 (RS232-D) interface and
    an adapter that allows it to be used for RS232-C as well. It is only
    supported with the DEC WANcontroller 614; it is not supported for
    use with the DEC WANcontroller 622 or 622/HS.

 2. The BC19C-02 adapter cable is used with a 50-way D-type connector
    with the DEC WANcontroller 614 when connecting to the BT Kilostream
    service or with the DEC WANcontroller 622 or 622/HS when connect-
    ing to the BT Kilostream and Megastream services, or X.21 leased
    line services. When connecting the DEC WANcontroller 618 to use the
    BT Kilostream service, the BC21G-02 should be used in conjunction
    with the V.11/RS422 distribution panel.

                                 30

 

 T1 and G.703 Services

 The DEC WANcontroller 622 and 622/HS support only clear channel in-
 terfaces. Connection to a T1 or G.703 line requires a V.35/RS422 to
 T1/G.703 DSU/CSU converter to provide framing to meet G.704. The DEC
 WANcontroller 622 and 622/HS do not provide either T1 framing pulses
 or separate channels for 64 Kbits/s control data for G.703.

 The DEC WANcontroller 622 and 622/HS do not guarantee line density.
 T1 links can offer only 1.536 Mbits/s or 1.344 Mbits/s rates. 1.536
 Mbits/s rates require the DSU/CSU converter to offer B8ZS and the line
 to accept bipolar violations. 1.334 Mbits/s rates require the DSU/CSU
 converter to offer B7.

 The DEC WANcontroller 622 and 622/HS use CCITT 114 to clock data out
 of the DTE and will source a CCITT 113 transmit clock. CCITT 113 should
 be used by the DCE to receive the transmit data. The DEC WANcontroller
 622 and 622/HS implement CCITT 113 as a buffered version of CCITT 114.
 This clocking scheme ensures both network synchronization and mini-
 mized skew between the clock and data for a range of cable lengths and
 parameters.

 If the transmit clocking mechanism is not provided by the DCE, the DCE
 must provide a method of adjusting the phase of the clock used to sam-
 ple the data with respect to that supplied to the DTE. This requires
 that the DCE provide test points to allow analysis of the clock and
 data wave forms and that this adjustment be performed on installation
 and after any subsequent alteration of the connection cable. This al-
 ternative method is also required for DCEs using the X.21 interface.

 The DECNIS ATMcontroller 631/E3 supports connection to an E3 line at
 a line rate of 34.368M bits/s as per G.703. The DECNIS ATMcontroller
 631/T3 supports connection to a DS3 line at a line rate of 44.736M bits
 /s as per G.703. Connection to E3 or DS3 lines is provided using dual
 75 ohm BNC connectors. Certain service providers may require a sep-
 arate CSU to isolate the ATMcontroller 631 from the network.

 The DECNIS HSSIcontroller 641 supports connection to inverse multi-
 plexed T1/E1, E2, E3 and T3/DS3 lines via a suitable DSU/CSU Connec-
 tion is provided using an EIA-613 HSSI interface.

                                 31

 Notes:

 1. The X.25 relay does not act on any of these fields. The informa-
    tion contained in these fields is passed transparently and has only
    end-to-end significance.

 2. PSDN hunt groups are supported but each DTE must be assigned a unique
    address independent of the hunt group address.

 3. Support for this facility depends on the user application and the
    X.25 client implementation. Refer to the X.25 client product SPD
    for details.

 4. For connector mode operation, the facilities supported by the DEC-
    NIS software may be restricted by the X.25 client implementation.
    Refer to the X.25 client product SPD for details.

 The DECNIS software does not support the following items of the ITU-
 T X.25 recommendation:

 -  Multi-link protocol

                                 39

 

 -  Use of the D-bit in outgoing packets

 Performance

 When operating over serial line connections the overall packet rate
 will be less than that indicated by the aggregate line speeds and is
 determined by such factors as:

 o  Type of traffic (routing updates or data packets) and data rates

 o  Mix of protocol types

 o  Proportion of leased line to X.25 and Frame Relay traffic

 o  The path of messages passing through the product (WAN-to-WAN, WAN-
    to-LAN, or LAN-to-LAN)

 o  Communications line characteristics

                                 41

 

 o  Frequency and type of errors on the serial links

 o  Network topology

 o  Protocol overhead

 Please contact your local DIGITAL office for further details of the
 performance characteristics of the DECNIS product.

 These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
 sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
 system environment, configuration, and software options. The space in-
 dicated for permanent occupancy does not include the space required
 to receive an upline dump if that facility is enabled. The amount of
 space required for dumps depends on the exact hardware configuration.
 This could be from 20,000 to 100,000 blocks (10 MB to 50 MB) for each
 dump depending on the DECNIS configuration.
