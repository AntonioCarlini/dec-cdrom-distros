 PRODUCT NAME:  VAX ISDN, Version 2.2                   SPD 31.23.04

 DESCRIPTION

 The VAX ISDN communication software product allows suitably config-
 ured OpenVMS VAX systems to connect to ISDN networks based upon the
 corresponding CCITT Recommendations via a Basic Rate access. Connec-
 tions are established using the circuit-switched access of the ISDN
 networks. Table 1 in this Software Product Description (SPD) list the
 ISDN public networks and switches supported.

 VAX ISDN is an OpenVMS VAX layered product that provides circuit-switched
 call control functions. This allows data transfers over one or two B-
 channels provided by the ISDN network at a Basic Rate access, using
 the following protocols:

 o  DECnet (Phase IV or Phase V implementation)

    VAX ISDN allows using DECnet "circuits" to remote DECnet nodes across
    the ISDN network.

    Note: A DECnet license is required to communicate with other DEC-
    net nodes over such circuits.

 o  VAX Packetnet System Interface (P.S.I.)

    VAX ISDN also allows using X.25 network protocol (VAX P.S.I.) for
    communication across the ISDN network.

 o  Specific Protocols

    VAX ISDN also allows using specific network protocols (DDCMP and
    HDLC) for communication across the ISDN network.

                               DIGITAL                 November 1993

                                                         AE-NS24E-TE

 

 VAX ISDN provides the following functions at the VAX node physically
 connected to the ISDN network:

 o  The ability to support three modes of operation at the controller
    level.

    -  Simple mode: Calls are set up and cleared whenever explicitly
       requested either by a system operator or an application program.

    -  Authorized mode: The only difference between this mode and sim-
       ple mode is that incoming calls that pass the incoming setup in-
       formation filter are accepted only after they have been explic-
       itly authorized by an application program.

    -  Time-cutting mode: Automatically establishes a circuit-switched
       connection to a predefined destination and minimizes circuit us-
       age cost by automatically clearing a communication when no user
       or network management data has been transferred for a user-specified
       length of time. This technique is called "time-cutting."

    Controller level means both units (each B-channel of the S0 basic
    rate access corresponds to one unit) must work with the same mode.

 o  The ability for user-written programs running under OpenVMS to con-
    trol incoming and outgoing calls. The following programming lan-
    guages are supported:

    -  VAX C

    -  VAX Pascal

    An ISDN Network Control Program (ISDN$NCP) is provided for manage-
    ment of VAX ISDN. This interface allows establishing outgoing calls,
    specifying ISDN addressing information and incoming call filters,
    accessing statistical information, requesting options or facili-
    ties and performing maintenance functions (such as setting the op-
    erating mode).

    A special security function is provided which allows users to limit
    the access to ISDN$NCP or ISDN$SA to a limited number of users on
    the local node or remote users operating VAX ISDN ACCESS.

                                  2

 

    Note: ISDN$NCP and ISDN$SA only support the Phase IV syntax for the
    node names (six characters). Then, ISDN$NCP and ISDN$SA can only
    support Phase V node names that have a Phase IV synonym.

    Problem solving is facilitated by the ability to trace and analyze
    data transferred between the ISDN network and the various layers
    of the VAX ISDN software over the D-channel of the Basic Rate ac-
    cess.

 o  The ability to establish and control ISDN connections using Open-
    VMS DCL commands. Three new DCL commands are added to the DCL ta-
    bles: ISDN CALL, ISDN CLEAR and ISDN SHOW CALLS. Using these com-
    mands, any user may request the automatic establishment of an ISDN
    connection and may clear it without knowing the specific parame-
    ters of the physical unit being used. Before having these commands
    fully operational on the OpenVMS VAX system, the system or network
    manager must configure some tables as described in the chapter "Call
    Management Software" of the Management Guide.

 o  The options and network facilities supported by VAX ISDN vary ac-
    cording to the local ISDN network in use. Table 3 lists the options
    that VAX ISDN is capable of supporting.

 Note: A VAX ISDN ACCESS (SPD 31.24.xx) license is required for control-
 ling incoming and outgoing calls from remote OpenVMS user programs and
 for managing the VAX ISDN product from a remote ISDN Network Control
 Program.

 Public Networks Supported

 Table 1 describes public ISDN networks, which are supported with VAX
 ISDN only in the countries specified. Connections to public networks
 outside this table are customer supported only.

 Since the publication of this SPD, other configurations may have been
 tested. Please consult your local Digital office for any questions con-
 cerning other public ISDN networks not listed.

 Options and Facility Support

 VAX ISDN support for any given ISDN option or facility depends on sup-
 port for it in the corresponding ISDN network. Generally, the VAX ISDN
 design includes restrictions on the use of options or network facil-
 ities, and prevents the use of facilities not supported by the local
 ISDN network.

 Therefore, Tables 3 and 4 are to be interpreted as what VAX ISDN is
 capable of using, rather than what it will do when used on any par-
 ticular ISDN network. The product documentation describes specific op-
 tions, restrictions, and facilities available for the supported pub-
 lic ISDN networks.

 Customer Responsibilities

 In some cases, the ISDN network supplier imposes restrictions, lim-
 itations, or requirements on the proposed Digital network configura-
 tion, options, and facilities. The customer must understand and ad-
 here to these requirements for each and every ISDN network used.

 Before installation of the software, the customer must:

 o  Previously have installed all prerequisite software and hardware,
    including terminals.

 During installation, the appropriate kit (Phase IV or Phase V) is au-
 tomatically selected from the VAX ISDN distribution media depending
 on the DECnet version running at that time on the system. However, if
 the system is upgraded with DECnet/OSI later, the VAX ISDN kit will
 have to be un-installed (using appropriate command files provided with
 the product) and re-installed.

 Digital's Installation Services also require that the customer must:

 o  Have an ISDN Basic Rate Access (S0) line already installed.

 o  Make available for a reasonable period of time, as mutually agreed
    by Digital and the customer, all hardware, communication facili-
    ties, and terminals that are to be used during installation.

 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

 Processor and/or hardware configurations as specified in the System
 Support Addendum (SSA 31.23.03-x).

 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

 o  OpenVMS VAX Operating System

 Refer to the System Support Addendum (SSA 31.23.03-x) for availabil-
 ity and required versions of prerequisite/optional software.
