INTRODUCTION

This Software Product Description describes two separate products that
provide similar PC server capabilities:

o  PATHWORKS V6.0 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server)

o  PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS (LAN Manager)

Though similar, these products are based on different versions of the
LAN Manager protocol and have very different requirements regarding
the versions of OpenVMS required.

PATHWORKS V6.0 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) is based on the current
networking technology available from Microsoft[R], as delivered in Win-
dows NT servers. It requires OpenVMS V7.1 and will run on any Alpha
system that supports OpenVMS V7.1.

PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) is based on older LAN Man-
ager V2.2 technology from Microsoft but is supported on both Alpha and
VAX[TM] servers running a variety of OpenVMS versions.

Both products are distributed in one package and one license is valid
for both products.

This SPD has three sections:

o  PATHWORKS V6.0 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server)

o  PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS (LAN Manager)

PRODUCT NAME:  DIGITAL PATHWORKS V6.0 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server)

DESCRIPTION

DIGITAL[TM] PATHWORKS[TM] for OpenVMS[TM] (Advanced Server) is an Open-
VMS layered application that provides networking functionally equiv-
alent to that of the Windows NT[TM] Server - with additional features.

As a server for workstations on a network, the PATHWORKS Advanced Server
provides file and print shares that enable a community of desktop users
to share computing resources efficiently. The PATHWORKS Advanced Server
can function as a simple file and print server for a small, isolated
community of users or as the foundation of a large network distributed
over a wide geographical area.

The PATHWORKS Advanced Server represents the newest generation of LAN
Manager systems technology. It enhances the LAN Manager functional-
ity by incorporating the latest Microsoft technology to deliver pow-
erful new features for network administration and enhanced security.
The PATHWORKS Advanced Server can operate independently or in coop-
eration with systems running Windows NT Server software.

FEATURES

PATHWORKS Advanced Server adds a new dimension to general purpose Open-
VMS systems. In addition to providing traditional support for busi-
ness, scientific, and engineering applications, PATHWORKS Advanced Server
allows an OpenVMS system to appear to LAN Manager clients as a Win-
dows NT Server. PATHWORKS Advanced Server is based on Windows NT Server
source code from Microsoft and AT&T[R].

The major features of PATHWORKS Advanced Server are described in the
following sections.





                                 3

 

File Services

PATHWORKS V6.0 for OpenVMS provides LAN Manager-based clients with a
remote file system that appears as a transparent extension of the client
system's local computing environment.

PATHWORKS for OpenVMS file shares are based on Microsoft's Advanced
Server V3.0 SMB (Server Message Block) protocols.

Each file stored in a file service is stored as an OpenVMS file in Record
Management Services (RMS) format. Three types of RMS file or record
formats are allowed and supported on each volume:

o  Sequential stream

o  Sequential fixed length record (512 bytes per record)

o  Sequential undefined

Files stored in a file service are accessible to PC clients, OpenVMS
users, and to applications that can interpret the content and orga-
nization of the file as written by the client application.

Multiple LAN Manager clients can concurrently access files stored on
the server's disk through the file access modes and byte-range lock-
ing support provided by PATHWORKS.

The PATHWORKS Advanced Server lets network users share local OpenVMS
files. You can use discretionary access controls on each file and di-
rectory to specify the groups and users that can access files, to de-
fine the levels of access that each group or user is permitted, and
to control auditing as supported by Windows NT-like security. Addi-
tional security is provided by OpenVMS file and directory protections.

Print Shares

PATHWORKS for OpenVMS software lets DOS, Windows[R], Windows NT, Win-
dows 95[R], OS/2[R], and OpenVMS users share printers connected to Al-
pha computers and to OpenVMS cluster systems, as well as network-based
printers such as LAT[TM] printers and DIGITAL PrintServers[TM]. Print

                                 4

 

shares are supported in local area network (LAN) and wide area net-
work (WAN) environments. PC clients can print files from the DOS, OS/2,
Windows, Windows 95, and Windows NT operating systems as well as from
PC applications.

Multiple print shares may be defined for a single printer. For exam-
ple, separate services may be created for landscape-mode printing and
portrait-mode printing. Similarly, separate services may be created
for DIGITAL mode and IBM[R] ProPrinter[R] mode printing for a single
LA75[TM] printer.

PATHWORKS Advanced Server includes the DECprint[TM] Supervisor (DCPS)
Open product, which provides PostScript[R] and DEC[TM] ANSI printing
to selected industry-standard PostScript printers.

Sharing of Network Resources by Heterogeneous Users

Services provided by PATHWORKS for OpenVMS are accessible to PATHWORKS
LAN Manager clients as well as to Microsoft LAN Manager clients. All
clients using the services of a PATHWORKS for OpenVMS server must be
properly licensed. (For more information, see the Software Licensing
section.) Files are stored on the server in native OpenVMS RMS for-
mat. This allows information stored by the PCs using PATHWORKS for Open-
VMS to be shared with traditional OpenVMS users. In addition, this fea-
ture allows information to be shared among all PATHWORKS clients, in-
cluding those not based on Advanced Server technology. Concurrent file
access by host applications or non-Advanced Server clients is not sup-
ported.

Network Transport Support

PATHWORKS Advanced Server supports DECnet[TM] (Phase IV), DECnet-Plus[TM]
(formerly known as DECnet/OSI), TCP/IP, and NetBEUI network transport
software. One or multiple transport stacks can work concurrently on
the server.

The TCP/IP transport, which is sold as a separate product and avail-
able from various vendors, must include a PATHWORKS IP (PWIP) driver.


                                 5

 

NetBEUI transport software is included with the PATHWORKS V6.0 for Open-
VMS software. Using NetBEUI transport software, Advanced Server clients
can access the server in the LAN for file and print shares.

See the Software Requirements section of this SPD for information on
supported network transport software.

NetBIOS[TM] Interface Support

PATHWORKS Advanced Server supports the NetBIOS interface in DECnet,
TCP/IP, and NetBEUI networks. PATHWORKS Advanced Server uses NetBIOS
naming services and datagram services. A NetBIOS programming inter-
face is not provided, however. NetBIOS interface support includes the
support of multiple transport stacks on a single or different network
controllers.

NetBIOS support under TCP/IP includes a both a p-node and a b-node RFC
1001/1002 implementation. This implies that the NetBIOS interface is
supported under TCP/IP in both LAN and WAN environments. The Config-
uration Manager provides the ability to select name resolution for WAN
support with either LMHosts or Windows Internet Naming Services (WINS)
Server name resolution.

Flexible Security Models

The PATHWORKS Advanced Server security model accommodates both the Ad-
vanced Server security model and the OpenVMS security model. The server
may be configured to use the security implementation best suited to
the environment. In Advanced Server Only mode, the Advanced Server se-
curity model is enforced.

PATHWORKS Advanced Server employs a user-level security model. User-
level security provides precise control over access to shared resources,
including disk devices, directories, and printers. Control is based
on a password assigned to each user account and the access granted to
the resources.




                                 6

 

The PATHWORKS Advanced Server incorporates enhanced features that pro-
vide a high level of control over user and resource permissions and
auditing. These features include support of discretionary access con-
trol permissions on individual files, directories, and resources, and
complete auditing capabilities.

Like Windows NT Servers, the PATHWORKS Advanced Server does not sup-
port share-level security and operates in user-level security mode only.

In the Advanced Server and OpenVMS model, both the OpenVMS and Advanced
Server security models are enforced. The PATHWORKS Advanced Server en-
hances the Windows NT security model with OpenVMS security. Users who
require the additional security support can continue to protect their
resources based on OpenVMS.

Domain Support

PATHWORKS Advanced Server allows the network to be subdivided into ad-
ministrative groups of servers and clients called domains. A domain
is a group of servers and clients on a network and is the basic unit
of network administration. Each server running PATHWORKS for OpenVMS
can be a member of a single domain. A PATHWORKS for OpenVMS server can
be a Primary Domain Controller (PDC) or a Backup Domain Controller (BDC).
Domains are a convenient mechanism for controlling user access to the
network and for managing large networks.

A PATHWORKS for DIGITAL UNIX[R] Advanced Server can be part of the same
domain as a PATHWORKS for OpenVMS Advanced Server and can be desig-
nated as either the Primary Domain Controller or Backup Domain Con-
troller.

PATHWORKS for OpenVMS Advanced Server provides support for wide area
domains using either the LMHosts file or WINS (Windows Internet Nam-
ing Services).

This presence of the LMHosts file on the PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Ad-
vanced Server) server allows NetLogon services and security database
replication over wide area TCP/IP configurations. This file contains
a list of nodes from geographically dispersed sites synchronized by

                                 7

 

the Primary Domain Controller and accessible to clients in the server's
domain. However, use of the LMHosts file for replication over extreme
distances or in networks with slow transmission speeds is not recom-
mended.

Support for WINS integration allows PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Advanced
Server) servers to act as WINS clients; that is, to use the name reg-
istration and resolution facilities available from a Microsoft WINS
Server across routed wide area TCP/IP networks, thus enabling WAN sup-
port via WINS for domain functions, NetLogon services, and security
database replication.

Trust Relationships

The PATHWORKS Advanced Server supports trusts. Trust relationships al-
low users from other domains to access resources in the local domain,
and local domain users may access resources in other domains.

NetLogon Services

A single domain-wide logon lets a user access resources on any server
in this domain or on servers in other domains that trust this domain.

The domain capabilities of PATHWORKS Advanced Server make it possi-
ble for a user to issue a single logon request to gain access to mul-
tiple servers in a network. Running the NetLogon service forces the
validation of users' logon requests. The logon server that processes
the request checks its copy of the domain-wide user accounts database
for the user name and password supplied in the logon request.

TimeSource Services

DOS, Windows, and OS/2 clients can request date and time information
from the server system and set the local workstation date and time to
coincide with them.





                                 8

 

User Environment Management

Logon scripts can be used to configure MS-DOS[R] and Windows worksta-
tion user environments by making network connections and starting ap-
plications. User profiles can be created to make workstations easier
to use as well as to control workstation access to network resources.

Server Management and Control

The PATHWORKS Advanced Server can be managed from either the OpenVMS
server or a client workstation, using one of the following server man-
agement interfaces:

o  The PATHWORKS Advanced Server ADMINISTER command line interface,
   which can be accessed from a terminal or terminal emulator. It con-
   forms to standard DCL command syntax.

o  Windows NT server administration tools, which are included in the
   PATHWORKS Advanced Server software kit to be installed on Windows
   NT workstations, Windows 95 workstations, and Windows for Workgroups
   workstations. This set of tools, including Server Manager, User Man-
   ager for Domains, and Event Viewer, allows you to administer the
   PATHWORKS Advanced Server and Windows NT Server computers from net-
   work clients.

o  Windows NT ADMIN tools, which are available as part of the Windows
   NT Server.

o  PATHWORKS Configuration Manager (a character cell interface) to man-
   age local server configuration.

o  PATHWORKS License Manager (a character cell interface) to manage
   the PATHWORKS License Server.

These management utilities can be used to:

o  Manage file and printer shares, user accounts, and groups

o  Display and control server resources currently in use, such as ac-
   tive sessions, connections, and services.

                                 9

 

o  View context-sensitive online help that provides command syntax,
   options, and qualifiers for each menu item and command

The PATHWORKS Advanced Server can be remotely administered from PATH-
WORKS and Microsoft Windows client workstations. These workstations
include Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95, Windows NT.
PATHWORKS Advanced Server can also be managed remotely from Windows
NT Servers and PATHWORKS Advanced Servers.

PATHWORKS Configuration Manager Utility

The PATHWORKS Configuration Manager utility is a character cell in-
terface that allows the user to set up and modify the server's con-
figuration. For example, the user can configure the data cache size,
the security model, the number of supported clients, the types of trans-
ports, the type of WAN capabilities, and more. Any adjustments that
need to be made to the OpenVMS SYSGEN parameters to support the run-
ning of the server are automatically performed by the Configuration
Manager utility.

Integrating with OpenVMS

The PATHWORKS Advanced Server encompasses many of the features of the
OpenVMS Operating System, including OpenVMS clusters and symmetric mul-
tiprocessing. OpenVMS cluster configurations provide failover avail-
ability and extensive resource capacities by integrating multiple Open-
VMS systems that can be accessed using a single cluster name.

PATHWORKS Advanced Server includes support for a transport-independent
PATHWORKS cluster alias NetBIOS name that allows multiple cluster mem-
bers to appear as a single server to the connecting clients. This sup-
port provides higher availability. The PATHWORKS cluster alias name
has a load-balancing feature that connects clients to the cluster mem-
ber that is the least loaded at the time the session is established.
PATHWORKS V6.0 for OpenVMS also includes a high performance, cluster-
wide distributed data cache that provides scalability in a clustered
environment. Alpha clusters are supported by PATHWORKS Advanced Server.



                                10

 

Integrating with External Authentication

External authentication is an optional feature introduced in OpenVMS
V7.1 that lets OpenVMS systems authenticate designated users using their
Advanced Server domain with a single username and password combina-
tion. You can configure an external authentication for any PATHWORKS
Advanced Server user account mapped to an OpenVMS user account. Ex-
ternal authentication allows PATHWORKS Advanced Server users to log
on to the OpenVMS system, using PATHWORKS Advanced Server username and
password. For more information about external authentication for Open-
VMS Alpha, see SPD 25.01.xx.

Integrating with OpenVMS Security

PATHWORKS Advanced Server provides an extension to the Windows NT se-
curity model by supporting OpenVMS security enforcement as an optional
enhancement.

Alerter Service

The PATHWORKS Advanced Server includes an Alerter Service that sends
automatic alert messages to clients and users as specified in the LAN-
MAN.INI file.

Event Log Service

Event logs provide valuable information about server activities. The
administrator can select from several event types and, for each, whether
successful or unsuccessful attempts at specific operations are to gen-
erate event messages. Event messages are generated based on the au-
dit policy specified for the server and files and directories.









                                11

 

Installation Utilities

PATHWORKS Advanced Server is installed on the OpenVMS system using the
standard VMSINSTAL procedure. An Installation Verification Procedure
(IVP) is also included, which can be used to confirm that the server
software has been installed properly.

The installation procedure allows you to install just the PATHWORKS
Advanced Server server, just the NetWare[R] server, or both. It also
allows you to install just the PATHWORKS License Server or the Advanced
Server Upgrade utility.

If you are running the PATHWORKS for OpenVMS NetWare Server on the same
system, you must upgrade the NetWare server as well as the PATHWORKS
Advanced Server. The NetWare Server is upgraded automatically when you
install the PATHWORKS Advanced Server.

The first purchase of PATHWORKS for OpenVMS at each site should in-
clude DIGITAL installation service. Contact your local DIGITAL rep-
resentative for information on the service options available.

Year 2000-Ready

PATHWORKS V6 for OpenVMS has been tested to ensure that the product
will run in the Year 2000.

License Management

PATHWORKS for OpenVMS offers license management for client-based li-
censes (CCS, FPA, Designated Access, System, and CNS), server-based
licenses (FPS or PC Concurrent), and the new Client Access licenses,
which can be used in either client-based or server-based mode. (See
the Software Licensing section for details.)

The license deliverables for PATHWORKS products are Product Authoriza-
tion Keys (PAKs) that are then used with the OpenVMS License Manage-
ment Facility (LMF). These PAKs must be loaded into an LMF database,



                                12

 

using standard LMF procedures, on an OpenVMS system that is hosting
a PATHWORKS server or is acting as a PATHWORKS License Server.[1]

o  Client-Based License Management. PATHWORKS for OpenVMS provides a
   facility called the PATHWORKS License Server that acts as a proxy
   for client systems that require license keys stored in the LMF database
   on an OpenVMS system.

A single copy of the PATHWORKS License Server software provides and
verifies client-based licenses, or Client Access licenses being used
in client-based mode, for clients using NetWare or LAN Manager pro-
tocols. NetWare clients use the IPX transport to communicate with a
PATHWORKS License Server, while PATHWORKS Advanced Server clients and
PATHWORKS LAN Manager clients use the DECnet, TCP/IP, or NetBEUI trans-
port.

The PATHWORKS License Manager, which must execute on the same node as
the License Server, provides a user interface that allows the admin-
istrator to monitor client-based license usage, to manage license groups,
set alert levels, set logging levels for licensing events, enable or
disable the License Server, and revoke assigned licenses. The PATH-
WORKS License Manager is also used to preallocate licenses to specific
"groups" (including the special, predefined "Server-Based" group; see
below for details), and to reclaim a license from a client.

Each LAN needs only one active PATHWORKS License Server. (The new Li-
cense Server provided with PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) can
support every kind of PATHWORKS client-based license, as well as Client
Access licenses and all supported clients.)

The PATHWORKS License Registrar, which executes on the same system as
the file server, verifies the licenses for clients requesting access
to the server functions. Clients that can produce a valid Client Ac-
cess license are allowed access to the services offered by the PATH-
WORKS V6.0 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) server.

____________________
 Although  the License Server is active on a single node in a cluster,
  if that node goes down for any reason, the License Server will au-
  tomatically activate itself on another node in the cluster that is

  still running PATHWORKS.

                                13

 

o  Server-Based License Management. The PATHWORKS V6.0 for OpenVMS (Ad-
   vanced Server) server also allows client access based on the avail-
   ability of Client Access licenses in the local LMF database being
   used in server-based mode. If a client requesting access to the server
   fails to produce a sufficient client-based license, the PATHWORKS
   License Registrar software checks for the availability of a valid
   Client Access license being used in server-based mode. If one is
   available, the client is allowed access.

Client Access licenses can be put into server-based mode in one of two
ways:

   -  If the PATHWORKS License Server facility was not configured for
      the system where PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) is ex-
      ecuting, then all Client Access licenses loaded into the local
      LMF database on that system will be used in server-based mode.

   -  If the PATHWORKS License Server facility was configured for the
      system where PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) is execut-
      ing, then all Client Access licenses loaded into the local LMF
      database will, by default, be used in client-based mode.

To allow some or all of these licenses to be used in server-based mode,
use the PATHWORKS License Manager and allocate those licenses to the
special, predefined group called the "Server-Based" group. Licenses
available in the "Server-Based" group will then be available for use
in server-based mode.

Note: PATHWORKS V6.0 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) server allows you
to use Client Access licenses in both client-based and server-based
mode, simultaneously. However, because clients using Client Access li-
censes in client-based mode are already licensed to use the server soft-
ware, they never consume additional Client Access licenses allocated
for use in server-based mode by a PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Advanced Server)
server.





                                14

 

Accommodation of Retired Features

The following features of PATHWORKS V5.x for OpenVMS are not provided
in PATHWORKS V6.0 for OpenVMS:

o  Standalone and member server roles. PATHWORKS Advanced Server may
   be configured as a Primary or Backup Domain Controller.

o  FAT volumes. To continue to provide FAT volume access to clients,
   you must maintain the PATHWORKS LAN Manager server on a separate
   system. Files held within shares on a FAT volume must be migrated
   to PATHWORKS LAN Manager shares before you upgrade to PATHWORKS Ad-
   vanced Server.

o  Backward compatibility mode. This mode was used to ease the migra-
   tion from PATHWORKS V4.x to PATHWORKS LAN Manager. Make sure all
   clients making use of this connection format are upgraded before
   the installation of PATHWORKS Advanced Server.

o  Remote Boot service. If clients depend on remote booting, you must
   maintain the PATHWORKS LAN Manager server on a separate system. Trans-
   fer this function to another server that supports Remote Boot ser-
   vice before the upgrade.

o  Share-level security. PATHWORKS Advanced Server manages access to
   all resources through user-level security.

o  LAN Manager and Creator security mode. The server can be config-
   ured for PATHWORKS Advanced Server Only security model or for PATH-
   WORKS Advanced Server and OpenVMS security model.

o  PATHWORKS LAN Manager Net command line interface and ADMIN/PATHWORKS
   character cell interface. These features were replaced by the PATH-
   WORKS Advanced Server ADMINISTER command line interface. The AD-
   MINISTER command line interface provides automatic translation of
   Net commands that have ADMINISTER command equivalents.




                                15

 

A PATHWORKS LAN Manager server can be upgraded to a PATHWORKS Advanced
Server or can continue running PATHWORKS LAN Manager and act as a Backup
Domain Controller, member server, or standalone server in a domain in
which the Primary Domain Controller is a PATHWORKS Advanced Server or
a Windows NT Server computer. PATHWORKS Advanced Server maintains com-
patibility with LAN Manager client and server software.

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

The following systems, components, and peripherals specified are sup-
ported except as noted.

Processors Supported

All Alpha processors supported by the OpenVMS V7.1 Operating System
are also supported by PATHWORKS V6.0 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server).

Memory Requirements

On Alpha systems, PATHWORKS Advanced Server requires a minimum of 64
MB of physical memory for proper installation, configuration, and ex-
ecution of the software.

Note: This memory requirement is a minimum requirement only. Memory
requirements can vary widely according to the server CPU, the number
of clients using the server and their activities, and the number and
speed of the server's disks and the other applications running on the
server.

For example, a typical configuration supporting a light workload (word
processing or spreadsheet applications) for 50 PC users requires an
Alpha system with approximately 64 MB of memory. This means that 80%
of the system memory and CPU time are dedicated to PATHWORKS, even though
some work may use less.

Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size=1)

The following table provides the disk space requirements for the in-
stallation and configuration of PATHWORKS V6.0 for OpenVMS (Advanced
Server) either standalone or with PATHWORKS V1.0G for OpenVMS (Net-
Ware) software. By default, all entries are directed to the same disk,
but each may be directed to different disks.

These sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the
user's system environment, configuration, and software options.


                                17

 

You should also plan for additional, significant disk-space require-
ments for items such as data files, virtual memory section files, log
files - after the product is started and in use.

o  For the NetBEUI transport, PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Advanced Server)
   provides the same level of support for Ethernet and FDDI as the Open-
   VMS Operating System. For more information, see SPD 25.01.xx.

The PATHWORKS V6.0 for OpenVMS server does not support the DEFZA FDDI
controller.

CLUSTER ENVIRONMENT

PATHWORKS V6.0 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) supports Alpha-supported,
OpenVMS cluster configurations. OpenVMS cluster configurations for Al-
pha systems are fully described in the OpenVMS Cluster Software for
OpenVMS Alpha Software Product Description (SPD 42.18.xx).

PATHWORKS V6.0 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) supports up to 31 server
nodes in cluster. In other words, no more than 31 nodes in a cluster
can run PATHWORKS V6.0 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) concurrently. In
a typical scenario, the server is run on only a few central nodes -
to exploit the cluster's shared disks and high speed interconnect en-
vironment.

In a cluster, PATHWORKS V6.0 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) supports
simultaneous file access by all nodes running the server. A central
event log, central Advanced Server accounts, and share databases are
maintained in a cluster. In an Advanced Server domain, the OpenVMS clus-
ter represents a single domain member, whether it is acting as the Pri-
mary Domain Controller or as a Backup Domain Controller.

Network Transport Software

PATHWORKS V6.0 for OpenVMS includes NetBEUI network transport soft-
ware. DECnet or TCP/IP network transport software may also be required
by PATHWORKS for OpenVMS, depending on the transport used by clients
requiring connections to the server or for use of some features.

The following DECnet and DECnet-Plus products are supported by PATH-
WORKS V6.0 for OpenVMS:

For Alpha Systems:

o  DECnet-Plus V7.1 for OpenVMS Alpha, SPD 50.45.xx

o  DECnet for OpenVMS Alpha V7.1, SPD 48.48.xx

When PATHWORKS V6.0 for OpenVMS is to be used in a TCP/IP environment,
OpenVMS-based TCP/IP software is required. This software must be pur-
chased separately. The following TCP/IP transports support PATHWORKS
V6.0 for OpenVMS:

o  DIGITAL's TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS V4.1

o  Process Software Corporation's[TM] Multinet[TM] V4.0, Rev. B

o  Process Software Corporation's TCPware[R] for OpenVMS V5.1

Other PATHWORKS Server Software

PATHWORKS V6.0 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) and PATHWORKS V1.0G for
OpenVMS (NetWare) share some common components. As a result, only cer-
tain combinations of PATHWORKS server software can run on the same ma-
chine at the same time.

The following PATHWORKS server products can run on the same system as
PATHWORKS V6.0 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server):

o  PATHWORKS V1.3A for OpenVMS (Macintosh[R])

o  PATHWORKS V1.0G for OpenVMS (NetWare)

                                22

 

The following PATHWORKS server products cannot run on the same sys-
tem as PATHWORKS V6.0 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server):

o  PATHWORKS V1.0x for OpenVMS (NetWare). If the V1.0x (NetWare) server
   is installed on a system to which the V6.0 (Advanced Server) server
   is added, the V1.0 (NetWare) server is automatically upgraded to
   the V1.0G (NetWare) server. Only PATHWORKS V1.0G for OpenVMS (Net-
   Ware) can run on the same system as PATHWORKS V6.0 for OpenVMS (Ad-
   vanced Server).

o  PATHWORKS for OpenVMS V5.x. The PATHWORKS V6.0 for OpenVMS (Advanced
   Server) server can be upgraded from the V5.x server. Running the
   V6.0 server on a system also running the V5.x server is not pos-
   sible or supported. You cannot continue to run the PATHWORKS LAN
   Manager software, once the PATHWORKS Advanced Server server has been
   installed. PATHWORKS V6.0 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) cannot co-
   exist on the same OpenVMS cluster with PATHWORKS V5.x server.

PATHWORKS Advanced Server maintains full down-level compatibility with
LM client and server software. LM users can add a PATHWORKS Advanced
Server to an existing network and migrate to the new technology at their
own pace. A PATHWORKS LAN Manager server can be upgraded to PATHWORKS
Advanced Server technology or act as a Backup Domain Controller, mem-
ber server, or standalone server in a network in which the Primary Do-
main Controller is a PATHWORKS Advanced Server or a Windows NT Server
computer. The PATHWORKS Advanced Server can be deployed as a Primary
Domain Controller in a network comprising other PATHWORKS Advanced Servers,
Windows NT Servers, DIGITAL PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) servers,
or LAN Manager for OS/2 Servers. It can also act as a Backup Domain
Controller for other PATHWORKS Advanced Server or Windows NT Server
computers.

PRODUCT NAME:  DIGITAL PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS (LAN Manager)

DESCRIPTION

DIGITAL PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) is an OpenVMS lay-
ered application that provides the functions of a Microsoft LAN Man-
ager V2.2 server in a PC LAN environment - with additional features.
It is a member of the PATHWORKS family of products, which provides a
framework for integrating personal computers into an organization's
total information system, allowing users to share information and net-
work services across the entire organization.

The PATHWORKS family includes PC LAN server products running on Open-
VMS, DIGITAL UNIX, ULTRIX[TM], SCO[TM] UNIX, and OS/2 platforms pro-
viding industry-standard Network Operating System (NOS) services that
use Novell[R]'s NetWare, Microsoft's LAN Manager, and Apple[R]'s Ap-
pleShare[R] protocols. The PATHWORKS family also includes client soft-
ware for these servers, consisting of a multi-NOS management inter-
face called ManageWORKS[TM], enterprise-wide support capabilities such
as wide area transports (DECnet and TCP/IP), and applications such as
Mail and Terminal Emulation, allowing DOS, Windows, Windows NT, Win-
dows 95, Windows for Workgroups, OS/2, and Macintosh clients to par-
ticipate as full peers in a distributed computing environment.

FEATURES

PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS adds a new dimension to general purpose
OpenVMS systems. In addition to providing traditional support for busi-
ness, scientific, and engineering applications, this product allows
an OpenVMS system to appear to LAN Manager clients as a Microsoft LAN
Manager server. PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS is an implementation of
industry-standard Microsoft LAN Manager V2.2.

The major features of PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS are described in the
following sections.



                                25

 

File Services

PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS provides LAN Manager-based clients with
a remote file system that appears as a transparent extension of the
client system's local computing environment.

PATHWORKS for OpenVMS file shares are based on Microsoft's LAN Man-
ager V2.2 SMB (Server Message Block) protocols.

Each file stored in a file service is stored as an OpenVMS file in RMS
format. Three types of RMS file/record formats are allowed and sup-
ported on each volume:

o  Sequential stream

o  Sequential fixed length record (512 bytes per record)

o  Sequential undefined

Files stored in a file service are accessible to PC clients, OpenVMS
users, and to applications that can interpret the content and orga-
nization of the file as written by the client application.

Multiple LAN Manager clients can concurrently access files stored on
the server's disk through the file access modes and byte range lock-
ing support provided by the OpenVMS Operating System.

Print Shares

PATHWORKS for OpenVMS software allows DOS, Windows, Windows NT, Win-
dows 95, OS/2, and OpenVMS users to share printers connected to Al-
pha, VAX, or VAXserver[TM] computers and to OpenVMS cluster systems,
as well as network-based printers such as LAT printers and DIGITAL PrintServers.
Print shares are supported in local area and wide area network envi-
ronments. PC clients can print files from the DOS, OS/2, Windows, Win-
dows 95, and Windows NT operating systems as well as from PC appli-
cations.



                                26

 

Multiple print shares may be defined for a single printer. For exam-
ple, separate services may be created for landscape-mode printing and
portrait-mode printing. Similarly, separate services may be created
for DIGITAL mode and IBM ProPrinter mode printing for a single LA75
printer.

PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS includes the DECprint Supervisor (DCPS)
Open product, which provides PostScript and DEC ANSI printing to se-
lected industry-standard PostScript printers.

Sharing of Network Resources by Heterogeneous Users

Services provided by PATHWORKS for OpenVMS are accessible to PATHWORKS
LAN Manager-based clients as well as to Microsoft LAN Manager clients.
All clients using the services of a PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS server
must be properly licensed. (See the Software Licensing section of this
SPD.) Files are stored on the server in native OpenVMS Record Manage-
ment Services (RMS) format. This allows information stored by the PCs
using PATHWORKS for OpenVMS to be shared with traditional OpenVMS users.
In addition, this feature allows information to be shared among all
PATHWORKS clients, including those not based on LAN Manager technol-
ogy. Concurrent file access by host applications or non-LAN Manager
clients is not supported.

Network Transport Support

PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS supports DECnet, DECnet-Plus, TCP/IP, and
NetBEUI network transport software. One or multiple transport stacks
can work concurrently on the server.

The TCP/IP transport, which is sold as a separate product and avail-
able from various vendors, must include a PATHWORKS IP (PWIP) driver.

NetBEUI transport software is included with the PATHWORKS V5.0F for
OpenVMS software. Using NetBEUI transport software, LAN Manager clients
can access the server in the local area network for file and print shares.

See the Software Requirements section of this SPD for information on
supported network transport software.

                                27

 

NetBIOS Interface Support

PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS supports the NetBIOS interface in DECnet,
TCP/IP, and NetBEUI networks. PATHWORKS for OpenVMS utilizes NetBIOS
naming services and datagram services. A NetBIOS programming inter-
face is not provided, however. NetBIOS interface support includes the
support of multiple transport stacks on a single or different network
controllers. NetBIOS support under TCP/IP includes a b-node RFC 1001
/1002 implementation. This implies that the NetBIOS interface is sup-
ported under TCP/IP in local area network environments only.

Flexible Security Models

The PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS security model accommodates both the
LAN Manager security model and the OpenVMS security model. The server
may be configured to use the security implementation best suited to
the environment. In "LAN Manager Only" mode, the LAN Manager security
model is enforced. In "LAN Manager and OpenVMS" mode, both the Open-
VMS and LAN Manager security models are enforced. In "LAN Manager and
Creator" mode, OpenVMS security is applied to files not created by users
of the PATHWORKS server.

Domain Support

PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS allows the network to be subdivided into
administrative groups of servers and clients called domains. A domain
is a group of servers and clients on a LAN and is the basic unit of
network administration. Each server running PATHWORKS for OpenVMS can
be a member of a single domain. A PATHWORKS for OpenVMS server can be
a Primary Domain Controller, Backup Domain Controller, Member Server,
or a Standalone Server, depending on the environment. Domains are a
convenient mechanism for controlling user access to the network, and
for managing large networks.







                                28

 

PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS also provides support for wide area do-
mains using the LMHosts file. This file's presence on the PATHWORKS
for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) server allows NET Logons and UAS replica-
tion over some wide area TCP/IP configurations. The LMHosts file con-
tains a list of nodes from geographically disperse sites that are syn-
chronized by the primary domain controller and accessible to clients
in the server's domain. However, use of the LMHosts file for repli-
cation over extreme distances or in networks with slow transmission
speeds is not recommended.

Network Logon Services

The domain capabilities of LAN Manager make it possible for a user to
issue a single logon request in order to gain access to multiple servers
in a LAN. Running the netlogon service forces the validation of users'
logon requests. The logon server that processes the request checks its
copy of the domain-wide user accounts database for the user name and
password supplied in the logon request.

LAN Manager V2.2 API Support

PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS supports the LAN Manager V2.2 Application
Programming Interfaces, with the exception of Named Pipes and Mail-
slots. Note that LAN Manager APIs are not available to OpenVMS host-
based applications, but are available to PATHWORKS LAN Manager-based
clients, non-PATHWORKS LAN Manager clients, and OS/2 LAN Manager servers.

Remote Boot

The remote boot service included with PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS al-
lows DOS and Windows workstations to start up using information stored
on the server's hard disk instead of on their own local hard disks.
The PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS remote boot service is based on Mi-
crosoft's LAN Manager remote boot service, which uses the Remote Pro-
gram Load (RPL) protocol. Remote boot is supported over NetBEUI on Eth-
ernet networks. PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS supports MOP (Maintenance




                                29

 

Operation Protocol) as a secondary loader for clients without an RPL
ROM.

Mail Services

PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS includes a mail server component that al-
lows clients to send and receive electronic mail. The mail server is
based on the OpenVMS MAIL-11 product and requires DECnet as its com-
munications transport. It allows users of PATHWORKS Mail client soft-
ware to send and receive electronic mail messages without having to
log in to the OpenVMS system as an interactive user.

A mail account may be established on the OpenVMS server for each user.
Mail can be sent to this account by other PATHWORKS Mail users as well
as traditional users of OpenVMS mail software. The mail server then
routes messages to the appropriate client when the user logs onto the
server.

The PATHWORKS for OpenVMS mail server provides the PATHWORKS user with
folders, distribution lists, and delivery capabilities. Realtime no-
tification of new messages can be optionally enabled by the client.

Time and Date Services

DOS, Windows, and OS/2 clients can request date and time information
from the server system and set the local workstation date and time to
coincide with them.

PATHWORKS FAT File System

PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS includes the PATHWORKS FAT file system,
which is an alternative to, and designed to coexist with the OpenVMS
ODS-2 file system. It is based on the DOS File Allocation Table (FAT)
file system. PC files stored in the FAT file system are stored in na-
tive DOS format in a container file on the server system. Features of
the PATHWORKS FAT file system include:

o  support for multiple readers and writers of the container file


                                30

 

o  wide-area network access to files stored on the server in DOS for-
   mat

o  improved performance on file and directory operations over the Open-
   VMS ODS-2 file system

The PATHWORKS FAT file system may be used as a migration path from ex-
isting PATHWORKS V4.x disk service container files (see Accommodation
of Retired Features).

Server Management and Control

PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS supports several server management inter-
faces:

o  ManageWORKS, a Windows-based utility supplied with the PATHWORKS
   V5.0F for DOS and Windows client product

o  A character cell utility called ADMINISTER/PATHWORKS

o  The LAN Manager NET ADMIN command line interface which may be ac-
   cessed from a terminal or terminal emulator, or from a LAN Manager
   client, including the PATHWORKS for DOS and Windows client.

The management utilities can be used to:

o  Manage file and printer shares, user accounts, and groups

o  Display and control server resources currently in use, such as ac-
   tive sessions, connections, and services

o  View context-sensitive Help for each menu item and command

PATHWORKS Monitor

The PATHWORKS Monitor utility is a Windows-based application provided
with the PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS server software. PATHWORKS Mon-
itor collects data on server resource utilization and provides a real-
time graphical display of this information.

                                31

 

PATHWORKS Configuration

The PATHWORKS Configuration utility is an OpenVMS-based application
that allows the user to modify the server's configuration. For exam-
ple, the user can configure the data cache size, the security mode,
the number of supported clients and more. Any adjustments that need
to be made to the OpenVMS SYSGEN parameters are automatically performed
by the Configuration utility.

Enhanced Cluster Support

PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS includes support for a transport-independent
PATHWORKS cluster alias name service that allows multiple cluster mem-
bers to appear as a single server to the connecting clients, provid-
ing higher availability. The PATHWORKS cluster alias name has a load-
balancing feature which connects clients to the cluster member that
is the least loaded at the time the session is established. PATHWORKS
V5.0F for OpenVMS also includes a high performance cluster-wide dis-
tributed data cache that provides scalability in a clustered environ-
ment. VAX clusters, Alpha clusters, and mixed-architecture clusters
are supported by PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS.

Enhanced Performance via XQP+

PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS includes a special release of the enhanced
OpenVMS file system, known as XQP+ (eXtended QIO Processor Plus). XQP+
is separately installable to OpenVMS VAX V5.5-2. XQP+ is included with
OpenVMS VAX and Alpha V6.1 and later. When PATHWORKS V5.0F for Open-
VMS detects the existence of the enhanced file system, it automati-
cally takes advantage of its improved concurrency, multi-threading,
and directory caching features to provide better performance to file
system operations.








                                32

 

Installation Utilities

PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS is installed on the OpenVMS system using
the standard VMSINSTAL procedure. An Installation Verification Pro-
cedure (IVP) is also included, which can be used to confirm that the
server software has been installed properly.

The installation procedure allows you to install just the LAN Manager
server, just the NetWare server or both. It also allows you to install
just the PATHWORKS License Server.

DIGITAL recommends that a customer's first purchase of this software
product at each site include DIGITAL installation service. Contact your
local DIGITAL representative for information on the service options
available.

Security

External authentication is an optional feature introduced in OpenVMS
Version 7.1 that enables OpenVMS systems to authenticate designated
users using their LAN Manager domain using a single username/password
combination. This feature is supported in PATHWORKS V5.0E and later.
For more information about external authentication for OpenVMS VAX,
see SPD 25.01.xx.

License Management

PATHWORKS for OpenVMS offers license management for client-based li-
censes (CCS, FPA, Designated Access, System, and CNS), server-based
licenses (FPS or PC Concurrent), and the new Client Access licenses,
which can be used in either client-based or server-based mode. (See
Software Licensing section for details.)

The license deliverables for PATHWORKS products are Product Authoriza-
tion Keys (PAKs) that are then used with the OpenVMS License Manage-
ment Facility (LMF). These PAKs must be loaded into an LMF database,




                                33

 

using standard LMF procedures, on an OpenVMS system that is hosting
a PATHWORKS server or is acting as a PATHWORKS License Server.[2]

o  Client-Based License Management. PATHWORKS for OpenVMS provides a
   facility called the PATHWORKS License Server that acts as a proxy
   for client systems that require license keys stored in the LMF database
   on an OpenVMS system.

A single copy of the PATHWORKS License Server software provides and
verifies client-based licenses, or Client Access licenses being used
in client-based mode, for clients using NetWare or LAN Manager pro-
tocols. NetWare clients use the IPX transport to communicate with a
PATHWORKS License Server, while PATHWORKS LAN Manager clients and PATH-
WORKS Advanced Server clients use the DECnet, TCP/IP, or NetBEUI trans-
port.

The PATHWORKS License Manager, which must execute on the same node as
the License Server, provides a user interface that allows the admin-
istrator to monitor client-based license usage, to manage license groups,
set alert levels, set logging levels for licensing events, enable or
disable the License Server, and revoke assigned licenses. The PATH-
WORKS License Manager is also used to preallocate licenses to specific
"groups" (including the special, predefined "Server-Based" group; see
below for details), and to reclaim a license from a client.

Each LAN needs only one active PATHWORKS License Server. (The new Li-
cense Server provided with PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS (LAN Manager)
can support every kind of PATHWORKS client-based license, as well as
Client Access licenses, and all supported clients.)

The PATHWORKS License Registrar, which executes on the same system as
the file server, verifies the licenses for clients requesting access
to the server functions. Clients that can produce a valid client-based
license, or Client Access license, are allowed access to the services
offered by the PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) server.

____________________
 Although  the License Server can be active on a single node in a clus-
  ter, if that node goes down for any reason, the License Server will
  automatically activate itself on another node in the cluster that is

  still running PATHWORKS.

                                34

 

o  Server-Based License Management. The PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS
   (LAN Manager) server also allows client access based on the avail-
   ability of valid server-based licenses (either FPS and/or PC Con-
   current), and/or Client Access licenses being used in server-based
   mode in the local LMF database. If a client requesting access to
   the server fails to produce a sufficient client-based license, the
   PATHWORKS License Registrar software checks for the availability
   of a valid server-based license or Client Access license being used
   in server-based mode. If one is available the client is allowed ac-
   cess.

Client Access licenses can be put into server-based mode in one of two
ways:

   -  If the PATHWORKS License Server facility was not configured for
      the system where PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) is
      executing, then all Client Access licenses loaded into the lo-
      cal LMF database on that system will be used in server-based mode.

   -  If the PATHWORKS License Server facility was configured for the
      system where PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) is ex-
      ecuting, then all Client Access licenses loaded into the local
      LMF database will, by default, be used in client-based mode.

To allow some or all of these licenses to be used in server-based mode,
use the PATHWORKS License Manager and allocate those licenses to the
special, predefined group called the "Server-Based" group. Licenses
available in the "Server-Based" group will then be available for use
in server-based mode.

Note: PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) server allows you to
use both client-based and server-based licensing, simultaneously. How-
ever, because clients using client-based licenses, or Client Access
licenses in client-based mode, are already licensed to use the server
software, they never consume additional server-based licenses, or Client
Access licenses allocated for use in server-based mode, by a PATHWORKS
V5.0F for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) server.



                                35

 

Accommodation of Retired Features

The following features of PATHWORKS V4.x for OpenVMS are not provided
in PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS:

o  File services over LAST

o  Disk services

o  Remote boot over LAST

If PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS is installed on a server system which
had been running V4.x of the product, some aspects of the V4.x envi-
ronment related to the features listed above will be preserved. Disk
services will remain intact and available to pre-V5.0F clients. LAST-
based remote boot services will also remain intact and available to
pre-V5.0F clients.

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

The systems, components, and peripherals specified below are supported
except as noted.

Processors Supported

All VAX and Alpha processors that are supported by the version of the
OpenVMS operating system in use are also supported by PATHWORKS V5.0F
for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) with the following exceptions:

MicroVAX    MicroVAX I, MicroVAX II, MicroVAX 2000

VAXstation  VAXstation I, VAXstation II, VAXstation 2000, VAXsta-
            tion 8000

VAX         VAX-11/725, VAX-11/730, VAX 11/750, VAX 11/780, VAX
            11/782, VAX 11/785




                                36

 

Memory Requirements

PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS requires the following minimum physical
memory for proper installation, configuration, and execution of the
software:

   16 MB on VAX systems (24 MB if used with DECnet-Plus)

   64 MB on Alpha systems

Note that the memory requirements indicated above are minimum require-
ments only, and that memory requirements can vary widely according to
the server CPU, the number of clients using the server and their ac-
tivities, the number and speed of the server's disks and the other ap-
plications running on the server.

For example, a typical configuration supporting a light workload (word
processing or spreadsheet applications) for 50 PC users requires an
Alpha system with approximately 64 MB of memory or a VAX system with
approximately 16 - 24 MB of memory. This assumes that 80% of the sys-
tem memory and CPU time are dedicated to PATHWORKS, even though some
work loads may use less.

Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size=1)

The following table provides the disk space requirements for the in-
stallation and configuration of PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS (LAN Man-
ager) either stand-alone or with PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare)
software. By default, all entries are directed to the same disk, but
each may be directed to different disks.

Network Interface Controllers

PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) supports Ethernet, FDDI, and To-
ken Ring network hardware devices as described below:

o  For the TCP/IP transport, PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) sup-
   ports the network hardware devices supported by the specific TCP
   /IP product. For DIGITAL's TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS, consult SPD
   46.46.xx (for Alpha systems) or SPD 25.A4.xx (for VAX systems). For
   other TCP/IP products, contact the vendor.

o  For the DECnet transport using Ethernet, FDDI, or Token Ring, see:

   -  SPD 42.25.xx for DECnet for OpenVMS AXP, Version 6.1

   -  SPD 25.03.xx for DECnet/OSI V7.0 (or DECnet-Plus) for OpenVMS
      on VAX systems

   -  SPD 50.45.xx for DECnet/OSI, Version 7.0 (or DECnet-Plus Ver-
      sion 7.1) for OpenVMS Alpha

   -  SPD 48.48.xx for DECnet for OpenVMS VAX and Alpha, Version 7.0

o  For the NetBEUI transport, PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) pro-
   vides the same level of support for Ethernet and FDDI as the Open-
   VMS operating system. For more information, see SPD 25.01.xx. PATH-
   WORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) does not support NetBEUI over
   Token Ring on VAX systems.

The PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS server does not support the DEFZA FDDI
controller.

CLUSTER ENVIRONMENT

PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) supports all OpenVMS clus-
ter configurations. OpenVMS cluster configurations for Alpha systems




                                40

 

are fully described in the OpenVMS Cluster Software for OpenVMS Al-
pha Software Product Description (SPD 42.18.xx). OpenVMS cluster con-
figurations for VAX systems are fully described in the OpenVMS Clus-
ter Software for OpenVMS VAX Software Product Description (SPD 29.78.xx).

PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) supports up to 31 server nodes
in cluster. In other words, no more than 31 nodes in a cluster can run
PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) concurrently. In a typical
scenario, the server is run on only a few central nodes, to exploit
the cluster's shared disks and high speed interconnect environment.

In a cluster, PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) supports si-
multaneous file access by all nodes running the server. A central event
log and central LAN Manager accounts and share databases are maintained
in a cluster. In a LAN Manager domain, the OpenVMS cluster represents
a single domain member, whether it is acting as the primary domain con-
troller or as a backup domain controller.

The following PATHWORKS server products cannot run on the same sys-
tem as PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS (LAN Manager):

o  PATHWORKS V1.0x for OpenVMS (NetWare).
   If the V1.0x (NetWare) server is installed on a system to which the
   V5.0F (LAN Manager) server is added, the V1.0 (NetWare) server is

                                43

 

   automatically upgraded to the V1.0F (NetWare) server. Only PATH-
   WORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare) can run on the same system as PATH-
   WORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS (LAN Manager).

o  PATHWORKS for OpenVMS V4.x.
   The PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS server can be installed and con-
   figured on a system running the V4.x server, but actually running

LICENSING AND ORDERING INFORMATION:  DIGITAL PATHWORKS V6.0 and V5.0F

SOFTWARE LICENSING

PATHWORKS V6 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server)[3] is purchased by licens-
ing the clients or applications that use the services provided by the
product. There is no additional fee.

The license that clients require to use the PATHWORKS V6 for OpenVMS
(Advanced Server) software is referred to as a Client Access license
(PAK Product Name: PWLMXXXCA06.00). Though there is only one license
sold for any client using this PATHWORKS server, this license can be
used in one of two ways:

o  Client-based mode (also known as per-seat mode)

o  Server-based mode (also known as per-server or concurrent use mode)

These two different licensing modes are described in the following text.

o  Client-Based Licensing Mode. When a license for PATHWORKS V6 for
   OpenVMS (Advanced Server) is used in client-based licensing mode,

____________________
 All  previous versions of PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Advanced Server), in-
  cluding PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS (LAN Manager), are now licensed
  for use in exactly the same way as PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Advanced
  Server).  Though previously purchased licenses continue to be valid
  for use with pre-V6 servers, only the new Client Access licenses may
  be purchased when adding new clients to existing systems.

   In particular, all the licenses listed in Table 2, Previous Version
  Licenses Qualifying for Upgrade Licenses, are no longer sold but con-
  tinue to be valid and grant the right to use the PATHWORKS V5.0 for
  OpenVMS (LAN Manager) software.



                                45

 

   the right to use the server is assigned electronically to a par-
   ticular client or seat. Once the right is assigned, the client sys-
   tem may access all systems running PATHWORKS V6 for OpenVMS (Ad-
   vanced Server) as well as all systems running any previous version
   of PATHWORKS for OpenVMS.[4]

This mode of licensing PATHWORKS servers is normally used when a cus-
tomer has more than one PATHWORKS server and where clients normally
access more than one server at the same time. Because only one license
per client is required regardless of how many servers are being ac-
cessed, the client-based licensing mode can be more economical in these
situations when compared to server-based mode (described later).

Because a client with a client-based license cannot be refused access
to a server due to license limits, this mode of licensing is also use-
ful when you need to guarantee that a particular system will always
have access to one or more servers.

Note: To use this licensing mode, a small licensing agent must be loaded
and enabled on each licensed client. The code for this licensing agent
is distributed with the PATHWORKS V6 for OpenVMS server, is available
free on the Web, and is also available on CD-ROM at a nominal fee.

o  Server-Based Licensing Mode. When a license for PATHWORKS V6 for
   OpenVMS (Advanced Server)[5] is used in server-based licensing mode,
   the right to use the server is assigned electronically to a par-
   ticular server system running a copy of the software. Any client
   can then access this server and make as many connections to file
   services and print shares as needed.

____________________
 The  PAK associated with the Client Access license will work, in client-
  based mode, only with PATHWORKS V5.0 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) servers
  that have been upgraded to a minimum of V5.0E. Prior revisions of this

  product will not recognize or use this PAK.
 The  PAK associated with the Client Access license will work, in server-
  based mode, only with PATHWORKS V5.0 for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) servers
  that have been upgraded to a minimum of V5.0F. Prior revisions of this

  product will not recognize or use this PAK in this mode.

                                46

 

The PATHWORKS server will allow up to "n" clients to access its ser-
vices concurrently, where "n" is the total number of licenses being
used in server-based licensing mode. The server will not allow the "n+1st"
client to access its services, until one of the first "n" clients has
disconnected from the server.

Note: Though a server may have only "n" licenses available, any num-
ber of clients can potentially access that server. The restriction is
based only on the total number of clients that may connect to the server
at one time.

For example, if you have 100 licenses assigned to a PATHWORKS server
in server-based licensing mode, then any 100 clients can make use of
all services offered by the PATHWORKS server at one time. However, if
an additional client (the 101st) attempts to connect to the server,
the client will be denied access until one of the connected clients
disconnects from all services.

Server-based licensing works best in situations where all clients use
or access only one server and there are enough licenses available on
each system for all clients to access their assigned server. A "sys-
tem" is defined as either a standalone system or a cluster.

Note: Customers can choose which mode to use and can change the li-
censing mode, as their situation dictates, without contacting or no-
tifying DIGITAL.

Note also that any portion of multiple licenses delivered in a sin-
gle PAK can be used in server-based mode, while the remainder can be
used in client-based mode. Because a PAK can be legally loaded on only
one system, it is only the system where the PAK is loaded that can use
the licenses in server-based mode.
