PRODUCT NAME:  DIGITAL PATHWORKS V1.0 for OpenVMS      SPD 41.47.08
               (NetWare)

DESCRIPTION

DIGITAL PATHWORKS V1.0 for OpenVMS (NetWare[R]) is an OpenVMS layered
application that provides the functions of a NetWare V3.0 server in
a PC LAN environment. It is a member of the PATHWORKS family of 
products, which provides a framework for integrating personal computers
into an organization's total information system, allowing different
types of users to share information and network services across the
entire organization.

The PATHWORKS family includes PC LAN server products running on OpenVMS
and DIGITAL UNIX[R] platforms, providing industry standard Network
Operating System (NOS) services that use protocols developed by
Novell[R], Microsoft[R], and Apple[R]. The PATHWORKS family also 
includes client products providing both client software for these servers
and enterprise-wide support capabilities such as wide area transports
(DECnet and TCP/IP) and applications such as Mail and Terminal 
Emulation, allowing DOS, Windows[TM], Windows 95, Windows NT[TM], and 
Macintosh[R] clients to participate as full peers in a widely distributed
computing environment.

FEATURE OVERVIEW

PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) adds a new dimension to general 
purpose OpenVMS systems. In addition to providing traditional support for
business, scientific, and engineering applications, this product 
allows OpenVMS systems to appear to NetWare clients as Novell-certified
NetWare servers.

                                                     September 1997

                                                        AE-PPMGJ-TH

 

The major features of PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) include:

o  Novell-certified file and print services using Novell's NetWare Core
   Protocol and the IPX/SPX transports.

o  Access to services provided by PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) 
   available to PATHWORKS and other NetWare clients with appropriately 
   licensed components. (See the License Management section for details.)

o  Files are stored on the server in native OpenVMS format. This 
   allows information stored by the PCs using PATHWORKS for OpenVMS 
   (NetWare) to be shared with traditional OpenVMS users. In particular,
   this feature allows the sharing of information between all PATHWORKS
   clients, even if they are not using NetWare.

o  Printing support not only allows NetWare clients to use an OpenVMS
   system running PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) to act as a generic
   NetWare Print Server, but this support also allows interactive OpenVMS
   users to direct jobs to remote, native NetWare print servers
   by simply directing their print jobs to local OpenVMS print queues.

o  File and print services management using standard NetWare management
   utilities, such as FCONSOLE, PCONSOLE, and SYSCON. These functions,
   combined with other standard systems and network management
   utilities for OpenVMS, such as Remote System Management (RSM), provide
   a powerful set of tools for total distributed systems management.

o  Either NetWare-only, or NetWare combined with OpenVMS security models,
   can be applied in this environment, providing greater flexibility
   and added security to your system.

o  A mail server is provided that works with the OpenVMS Mail 
   utility and the PATHWORKS Mail client to provide clients with access
   to enterprise-wide electronic mail over DECnet.

o  A DECnet tunnel function for the IPX transport is provided. This
   function encapsulates IPX packets in DECnet packets, thereby 
   allowing information sent over IPX to be transported anywhere within
   a DECnet network. This allows existing DECnet-based wide area 
   networks (WANs) to be used to transport IPX-based traffic from IPX 
   local area networks (LANs) on one side of the WAN to another.

                                 2

 

o  New Novell Virtual Terminal (NVT2) support is provided, employing
   SPX as the new underlying transport. NVT2 support provided for DOS
   clients allows IPX-based terminal emulation software to be used on
   a PC for direct, interactive connections to the OpenVMS systems where
   PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) is operating.

o  NetWare (file and print) Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
   are provided.

o  The host-based SCONSOLE Utility provides systems managers and 
   administrators with a single menu-driven tool to configure and 
   administer OpenVMS-specific functions such as starting and stopping
   the file server, the IPX/SPX transports, or the DECnet tunneling
   function for IPX.

o  License Management software, now capable of supporting PATHWORKS
   users of both NetWare and LAN Manager clients, provides the 
   capability to:

   a. Distribute PATHWORKS client-based licenses across a network

   b. Validate access by clients with PATHWORKS client-based licenses

   c. Support client access using server-based licenses validated through
      the local OpenVMS License Management Facility (LMF) database

Note that (a) and (b) are accomplished with PATHWORKS license management
software for the client.

FEATURE DETAILS

NetWare Volumes/File Services

PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) provides NetWare clients with a 
remote file system that appears as a transparent extension of the client
system's local computing environment.

PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) services are based on Novell's NetWare
Core Protocols (NCPs) and have been certified by Novell as a fully
compliant implementation of Portable NetWare, V3.01B.

                                 3

 

Three RMS file formats are allowed and supported on each volume:

o  Stream

o  Sequential fixed length record (512 bytes per record)

o  Sequential fixed length record of a specified record size (1 to 32K
   bytes per record)

Included with PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) is a feature called a
hybrid user. This feature allows users who are both interactive 
OpenVMS users and users of PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) to access both
their NetWare-created information and their interactive OpenVMS user
directory while logged in as a NetWare user.

If you are identified as a hybrid user, a special volume called HOME
is created when you log in. HOME points to your login directory in your
OpenVMS account. You can map drives to this HOME volume and/or to 
directories below it. You have access rights to all files in that 
directory just as if you were logged in to your account on OpenVMS.

Multiple NetWare clients can concurrently access files stored on the
server's disk through the file access modes and byte-range locking
support provided by the server as defined by Novell's NCPs.

Through the use of the VMS Lock Manager, OpenVMS and PC applications
can control file access.

Print Services

PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) software allows NetWare clients to 
access printers used by interactive OpenVMS users and other PATHWORKS
clients that may not be using NetWare. These printers can be connected
to the OpenVMS server, OpenVMS cluster, or LAT-supported terminal servers
in a LAN.

The system administrator assigns a service name, called a NetWare print
queue, to an OpenVMS print queue and can define NetWare user access
to the print service. NetWare client software can redirect printer I/O
from a client printer port to a defined NetWare print queue.

                                 4

 

The system administrator creates, on the host, the physical and generic
queues and defines forms for selected DIGITAL and third-party printers
using standard OpenVMS commands. The administrator then uses the
PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) SCONSOLE utility to associate NetWare
print queues with OpenVMS print queues. Refer to the Optional 
Hardware section for details.

Multiple NetWare print queues may be set up for the same printer. For
example, a landscape service and a portrait service may be created for
the same PrintServer 40 Plus printer. In addition, other printer queues
can be manually set to support additional DIGITAL and third-party printers
that are not listed in the menus.

NetWare print queues and the NetWare print servers servicing those queues
may reside on different physical systems. Because PATHWORKS for OpenVMS
(NetWare) includes a NetWare-compliant PSERVER implementation, it
is compatible with many versions of Novell's print servers, including:

o  NetWare 3.X (PSERVER.NLM)

o  NetWare 2.X (PSERVER.VAP)

o  Dedicated DOS (PSERVER.EXE)

o  Network printers providing a NetWare compliant PSERVER implementation

o  Router VAP

o  NetWare for UNIX print server daemons

Compatibility with NetWare for UNIX print server daemons means that
PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) will interoperate with other Novell
Certified implementation of NetWare for UNIX provided by DIGITAL or
by other vendors.

Any type of NetWare print server is capable of servicing NetWare print
queues located on any NetWare file server. To service NetWare print
queues associated with remote NetWare file servers, a PATHWORKS for
OpenVMS (NetWare) print server must be configured to attach to each

                                 5

 

NetWare file server associated with each NetWare print queue that it
will service.

Similarly, to be serviced by remote NetWare print servers, a PATHWORKS
for OpenVMS (NetWare) print queue would need to be configured to 
allow this access.

NetWare clients logged into a PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) file server
can also access other NetWare print services available in the network,
either by attaching directly to the associated NetWare file server or
using the PCONSOLE utility.

Interactive OpenVMS users can also queue print jobs to remote NetWare
print servers by simply queuing to normal OpenVMS print queues that
have been set up by PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) to send print jobs
to the desired remote NetWare print server.

Server Management and Control

SCONSOLE, an OpenVMS Utility used with standard NetWare client 
utilities, provides the complete set of tools needed to manage the 
PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) server.

SCONSOLE is used to manage OpenVMS-specific functions related to this
product. In particular, SCONSOLE is used to:

o  Start and stop the server, in its entirety or in part

o  Create, modify, and remove volumes

o  Associate NetWare print queues with OpenVMS print queues

o  Modify server security settings

o  Add and delete hybrid users

o  Configure and tune server components

o  Display server specific statistics and information

                                 6

 

Network Connectivity

o  IPX/SPX

The PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) software includes an OpenVMS 
implementation of the two transport protocols used by Novell's native
NetWare products:

   -  IPX (Internetwork Packet Exchange)

   -  SPX (Sequenced Packet Exchange)

IPX is delivered as a STREAMS driver in this product and is used for
all NetWare-related client/server functions. The IPX protocol is 
transmitted as datagram packets between source and destination.

SPX provides a layer above the IPX protocol that tracks IPX packets
to ensure that each packet is successfully received by its intended
destination.

o  Novell Virtual Terminal (NVT2) Protocol

NVT2 support consists of server software and software that must be loaded
on each client.

On the PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) server, an OpenVMS process 
provides Virtual Terminal services over SPX (using IPX). Each NVT2 
connection requires a corresponding SPX connection. Therefore, a 
maximum of 1000 concurrent NVT2 connections can be supported.

The NVT2 software for DOS-based clients (TSR or VLM) redirects 
terminal I/O through INT14 or INT6b interrupt modes, the interfaces used
by most terminal emulation applications. Note that the PATHWORKS V6.0
for DOS and Windows SETHOST terminal emulation application also uses
these interfaces.

o  IPX Tunneling Within DECnet

PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) includes the capability of connecting
one or more NetWare LANs using a DECnet WAN. The tunnel driver 
encapsulates IPX datagrams within DECnet packets transmitted across the
DECnet network to the tunnel partner and then de-encapsulates the IPX
datagram, routing it to its intended destination.

                                 7

 

Performance-Enhancing XQP+ Services

PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) includes a special release of the 
enhanced OpenVMS file system, known as XQP+ (eXtended QIO Processor Plus).
XQP+ is integral to OpenVMS V6.1 or later and is separately instal-
lable on VAX/VMS V5.5-2 and OpenVMS VAX V6.0 systems. XQP+ provides 
improved concurrency using multithreading, which results in improved 
performance for file system operations.

Mail Services

The mail server component of PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) provides
a service that is separate and distinct from the NetWare file and print
services. This mail server is based on the OpenVMS MAIL utility and
requires DECnet as its communications transport. It allows PATHWORKS
users, using the client PATHWORKS Mail software, to send and receive
electronic mail messages without having to log in to the OpenVMS 
system as an interactive user.

A mail account may be established on the OpenVMS server for each user.
Mail can be sent to this account by other PATHWORKS Mail users as well
as traditional users of OpenVMS mail software. The mail server then
routes messages to the appropriate client when the user logs on to the
server.

The PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) mail server provides the PATHWORKS
user with folders, distribution lists, and delivery capabilities. Also,
notification of new messages occurs both in real time (which may be
optionally disabled) and upon log in to a network MAIL session.

Installation and Configuration

PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) shares code with, and is distributed
with, both PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS (LAN Manager) and with 
PATHWORKS V6.0 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) (though still licensed 
separately). A single installation procedure is shared between PATHWORKS
for OpenVMS (NetWare) and PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS (LAN Manager).



                                 8

 

Another, different single installation procedure shared between 
PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) and PATHWORKS V6.0 for OpenVMS (Advanced
Server). Both procedures provide for the installation of one or both
associated server products in a single step on an OpenVMS system 
using the standard VMSINSTAL procedure. An Installation Verification
Procedure (IVP) is also included, which can be used to confirm that all
server software has been installed properly.

DIGITAL recommends that a customer's first purchase of this software
product at each site include DIGITAL installation service. This 
service provides implementation support for customers installing 
PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) software and for the integration of PC 
workstations into the DIGITAL network. Contact your local DIGITAL 
representative for information on the service options available.

License Management

PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) offers several license management 
capabilities related to both client-based and server-based licenses.

o  Client-Based License Management

PATHWORKS client licenses are provided as Product Authorization Keys
(PAKs) for the OpenVMS License Management Facility (LMF). These PAKs
must be loaded into an LMF database, using standard LMF procedures,
on an OpenVMS system that is acting as a PATHWORKS License Server.[1]
A single copy of the PATHWORKS License Server software can now 
provide and verify client-based licenses for clients using NetWare and
LAN Manager software. NetWare clients use the IPX transport to 
communicate with a PATHWORKS License Server, while LAN Manager clients
use the DECnet, NetBEUI, or TCP/IP transports.

____________________
[1] Although  the License Server can be active only on a single node in
a cluster, if that node goes down for any reason, the License Server
will automatically activate itself on another node in the cluster that
is still running PATHWORKS.


                                 9

 

The PATHWORKS License Manager, which must execute on the same node as
the License Server, provides a user interface that allows the system
manager to monitor client license usage. The PATHWORKS License Manager
is also used to preallocate licenses to specific groups of users
and to reclaim a license from a client.

The PATHWORKS License Registrar, which executes on the same system as
the file server, will "handshake" with clients requesting access to
PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) functions. Clients that can success-
fully "handshake" with the server and produce a valid client-based 
license will be allowed access to the services offered by the PATHWORKS
for OpenVMS (NetWare) server.

o  Server-Based License Management

The PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) server also allows client access
based on a local server-based license. If a client requesting access
to the server fails to produce a valid client-based license, the 
PATHWORKS License Registrar software checks the local LMF database for the
availability of a PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) PC Concurrent 
(formerly known as FPS) license. If one is available, and the number of
concurrently connected clients allowed by the license has not been 
exceeded, the client will be allowed access.

PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) servers always allow you to use both
client-based and server-based licenses, simultaneously. However, 
because clients that do have a valid client-based license are already
licensed to use the server software, they are never counted against
the fixed number of clients granted access by the server-based PC 
Concurrent license.

RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS

o  NetWare NLMs are not usable with a PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare)
   server. NetWare NLMs are typically applications or utilities written
   specifically for an Intel platform using NetWare 3.x or for an
   Intel platform using NetWare 4.x as the host operating system. They
   are not easily portable to other environments.


                                10

 

o  Portable NetWAre V3.01B

PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) is an implementation of Portable 
NetWare V3.01B. As such, certain features currently available in Novell
NetWare 3.x, Intel-based servers are not included. Among these 
features are:

   -  The PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) print server implementation
      cannot be used with DOS-based clients configured with RPRINTER.EXE
      or network-based printers that implement NetWare's RPRINT 
      protocol.

   -  Burst mode technology, or "packet burst", is not supported

   -  Windows NT client software from Novell is not supported. 
      However, Windows NT NetWare client software from Microsoft is 
      supported.

o  The DOS utilities specific to PC hardware devices such as CHKDSK,
   FDISK, DISKCOPY, DISKCOMP, and FORMAT cannot be used with PATHWORKS
   server volumes.

o  Unsupported wire protocols include:

   -  Ethernet using IEEE 802.3 (SNAP) frame type (used mainly by 
      Macintosh systems)

   -  Arcnet

   -  Token Ring on VAX systems (Token Ring on Alpha systems is supported.)

o  The OpenVMS Spiralog file system is not supported.

o  Though Novell's raw 802.3 Ethernet frame type is supported, some
   usage restrictions will always apply, because it does not conform
   to the IEEE specifications. In particular, this frame type should
   not be used on any OpenVMS system using the DECnet-Plus protocol
   (the default for OpenVMS V7.1 and later). See the product documen-
   tation for additional information.

o  PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) is not supported with OpenVMS VAX
   V6.0 or with OpenVMS Alpha V1.5.

                                11

 

o  The NetWare utility, Salvage, is not supported (incompatible with
   the OpenVMS file system).

o  PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) supports a maximum of

   -  250 simultaneous users per OpenVMS node (an inherent NetWare 3.x
      limitation)

   -  250 NetWare volumes

   -  1000 SPX connections (each NVT2 session uses an SPX connection)

o  Though NetWare volumes may be dynamically marked for addition or
   deletion, volumes are only added or deleted when the server is restarted.

VARIANTS DELIVERED AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER PATHWORKS SERVERS

Two slightly different versions of PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) are
delivered with the distribution kits. Both sets of code provide the
exact same functions and capabilities; however, they are designed to
function in different environments.

o  PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare)

Delivered on the PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS distribution media and
designed to coexist with PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS (LAN Manager)
software, it can be run on VAX and Alpha systems and with a number of 
different versions of OpenVMS either stand alone or coexisting with 
PATHWORKS V5.0F for OpenVMS (LAN Manager).

o  PATHWORKS V1.0G for OpenVMS (NetWare).

Delivered on the PATHWORKS V6.0 for OpenVMS distribution media and 
designed to coexist with PATHWORKS V6.0 for OpenVMS (Advanced Server)
software, it can be run only on Alpha systems with OpenVMS V7.1 
either stand alone or coexisting with PATHWORKS V6.0 for OpenVMS
(Advanced Server).



                                12

 

Though both V1.0F and V1.0G can be run stand alone and would deliver
identical services, V1.0F should normally be used, because the 
hardware and software environments it supports include all those supported
by V1.0G and and many more.

Network Interface Controllers

At least one network interface controller is required for use with 
PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare). The following devices are supported:

o  All DIGITAL VAX and Alpha Ethernet controllers

Supported Ethernet frame types include:

   -  Ethernet II

   -  IEEE 802.3 (SAP). (Novell refers to this frame type as "802.2.")

   -  Raw 802.3. (Novell refers to this frame type as "802.3.")
      (For more information, see the Restrictions section.)

                                17

 

o  All DIGITAL VAX and Alpha FDDI controllers

o  All DIGITAL Token Ring controllers for Alpha systems.

Optional Hardware: DIGITAL Printers

All printers supported by the OpenVMS Operating System using print queues
are also supported by PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare).

DIGITAL PostScript[R] printers require the use of DECprint Supervi-
sor (DCPS) for OpenVMS V1.3. DCPS software is included with the 
PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) media, but the use of the DCPS software
requires the purchase of an appropriate license.

Refer to SPD 44.15.xx for DCPS licensing information and for a 
complete list of the DIGITAL and non-DIGITAL PostScript printers supported
by DCPS.

OpenVMS CLUSTER ENVIRONMENT

The PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) server provides for a common 
NetWare SYS volume across OpenVMS cluster members running the server. This
means that a single bindery and trustee database is maintained clusterwide.





                                19

 

In addition, NetWare volumes can also be made available clusterwide.
A volume defined by SCONSOLE on one cluster member running the server
can also be configured so that it is available to all other cluster
servers. However, concurrent file sharing between servers running on
different cluster members is not supported.

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

Operating System Software

o  For PATHWORKS V1.0F for OpenVMS (NetWare):

   -  For Alpha Systems:

OpenVMS Alpha Operating System V6.1, V6.2, V7.0, and V7.1

   -  For VAX Systems:

VAX/VMS Operating System V5.5-2
      OpenVMS VAX Operating System V6.1, V6.2, V7.0, and V7.1

o  For PATHWORKS V1.0G for OpenVMS (NetWare):

OpenVMS Alpha Operating System V7.1

For minimum hardware requirements of the operating system, refer to
the Software Product Descriptions for the OpenVMS VAX Operating 
System (SPD 25.01.xx) and the OpenVMS Alpha Operating System (SPD 41.87.xx).

OpenVMS Tailoring

For use with VAX/VMS V5.5-2 systems, the following OpenVMS classes are
required for full functionality of this layered product:

o  OpenVMS Required Saveset

o  Network Support

o  System Programming Support

o  Secure User's Environment

                                20

 

o  OPTL (Miscellaneous Files)

For more information on OpenVMS classes and tailoring, refer to the
OpenVMS VAX Operating System Software Product Description (SPD 25.01.xx).

Network Transport Software

o  DECnet Software

The DECnet network transport software is required by PATHWORKS for 
OpenVMS (NetWare):

   -  When acting as a MAIL server for PATHWORKS clients

   -  To optionally tunnel IPX packets between two OpenVMS systems 
      using this software

   -  When the PATHWORKS License Server is configured to service 
      PATHWORKS clients using LAN Manager and DECnet.

The license to use DECnet software is usually bundled with your 
system but may need to be purchased separately.

Because the DECnet/IPX tunnel is a DECnet Phase IV implementation, its
use on systems with DECnet-Plus installed requires the definition of
network name synonyms.

o  TCP/IP Software

TCP/IP network transport software is only required by PATHWORKS for
OpenVMS (NetWare), if the PATHWORKS License Server is configured to
service PATHWORKS clients using LAN Manager and TCP/IP.

When TCP/IP software is used for this purpose, it must be purchased
separately. Please consult the Software Product Description for 
PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Advanced Server) and PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (LAN 
Manager), SPD 30.50.xx, for currently supported TCP/IP products.



                                21

SOFTWARE LICENSING AND ORDERING INFORMATION

PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (NetWare) can be licensed in two different ways.

o  Client-Based Licensing (Designated Access)

This product can be licensed for operation and access on any number
of supported platforms to provide services to clients assigned appro-
priate client-based licenses.

See the terms and conditions for Designated Access licenses on your
Product Authorizations Keys (PAKs) or on the Internet at 
http://www.digital.com/info/software-licensing
for a description of the specific rights granted. See the Applicable
Client-Based Licenses section later in this SPD for specific license
names and ordering information.


                                22

 

o  Server-Based Licensing (PC Concurrent)

A PATHWORKS PC Concurrent license for this product permits its use on
a single supported platform and allows access by clients that do not
have a PATHWORKS client-based license.

See the terms and conditions for PC Concurrent licenses on your Product
Authorizations Keys (PAKs) or on the Internet at 
http://www.digital.com/info/software-licensing
for a description of the specific rights granted. See the Applicable
Server-Based Licenses section later in this SPD for specific license
names and ordering information.

Note: Clients with client-based licenses for server access do not 
interfere with the access of other clients that rely on server-based 
licensing for access to a particular server. The two licensing methods
are designed to coexist.
