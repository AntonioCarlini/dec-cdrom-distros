 PRODUCT NAME:  Storage Library System                  SPD 29.67.18
                Version 2.9A for OpenVMS

 DESCRIPTION

 Data center managers face major storage management problems: system
 backup and restore complexity and effective file archiving and retrieval.
 The Storage Library System (SLS) for OpenVMS provides the solution for
 OpenVMS environments.

 SLS for OpenVMS includes a remote backup facility for OpenVMS clients.

 Features

 o  Automatic, flexible scheduling of backup operations

 o  Centralized services for user-requested backup and archiving op-
    erations

 o  Support for remote backup and archiving operations directly between
    disks and tape drives located on different OpenVMS systems within
    a DECnet or DECnet Plus network without staging data across disks

 o  Online maintenance of information about backed up and archived files
    and volumes; this allows quick retrieval of the files or restora-
    tion of disk volumes without the user having to know the names of
    the tape volumes on which the data was saved

 o  Support for OpenVMS systems in both mixed-interconnect and mixed
    architecture OpenVMS Clusters

 o  Integration with RMU/BACKUP and RMU/RESTORE, allowing backup and
    restore of Oracle Rdb[TM] databases using SLS managed media

                                                        January 1998

                                                         AE-LB73V-TE

 

 o  Effective use of all media capacity by appending multiple sets of
    backed up or archived files to the same volume or volume set

 o  Direct positioning to the start of each save set file during a re-
    store operation using saved information about the tape position of
    each save set file

 o  DCL and menu interfaces with online help for users, operators, and
    storage administrators

 o  Customization features to meet a variety of operational and site
    requirements

 SLS for OpenVMS provides the following important media and device man-
 agement capabilities:

 o  Support for unattended backup operations using a variety of auto-
    mated loaders including the StorageTek[R] automated cartridge server
    (Wolfcreek silo). For a complete list of supported devices, see the
    addendum titled Section 14.

 o  Media life cycle control including maintenance of volume retention
    period, availability status, location, and scheduling of dates when
    volumes are to move offsite and return

 o  Maintenance of counters for each volume noting the number of times
    a volume has been mounted and the number of errors associated with
    the volume; these counters are used to schedule volume cleaning when
    the counters exceed threshold values

 o  Control of media allocation based on customer-defined media pools

 o  Ability to print external tape labels in a customized format

 o  Built-in report generation and custom report generation capabil-
    ity

 o  Security features to prevent unauthorized media or device use

 o  "Round robin" device allocation to distribute drive usage among avail-
    able tape drives

                                  2

 

 o  In an OpenVMS Cluster environment, automatic failure recovery from
    the loss of a processor to allow continuous access to the SLS for
    OpenVMS media databases. This feature requires two server licenses.

 Remote Device Facility (RDF[TM])

 The Remote Device Facility (RDF) software is included within the SLS
 for OpenVMS software. It is optionally installed during the SLS soft-
 ware installation procedure. No additional license is needed for RDF
 when used within the bounds of SLS.

 RDF allows SLS to access a tapes from other OpenVMS nodes across the
 DECnet or DECnet-Plus network for backup and archive operations. RDF
 includes of the following components:

 o  RDF servers that execute tape I/O requests on behalf of a remote
    client. Servers are located on systems that have tape drives at-
    tached or on systems that can access drives through the OpenVMS TM-
    SCP Server.

 o  RDF clients that provide the communications interface between ap-
    plications reading or writing data to a tape drive and to the RDF
    servers.

 SLS for OpenVMS software makes access to remote tape drives transpar-
 ent to SLS backup and archive operations by issuing RDF commands as
 appropriate if a designated tape drive is a remote one. SLS for Open-
 VMS software also manages volume load requests to remote systems to
 allow unattended backups or to communicate with a console operator.
 SLS for OpenVMS makes no direct use of the remote disk capabilities
 inherent in RDF.

 LICENSE OPTIONS

 To support a variety of configuration requirements, the following SLS
 for OpenVMS license options are available:

 o  SLS for OpenVMS VAX Server

 o  SLS for OpenVMS Alpha Server

                                  3

 

 o  SLS for OpenVMS VAX Client

 o  SLS for OpenVMS Alpha Client

 o  SLS ACS for OpenVMS VAX

 o  SLS ACS for OpenVMS Alpha

 SLS for OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha Server

 SLS for OpenVMS server software provides full functionality, as de-
 scribed above, to users on the node or OpenVMS Cluster on which SLS
 is executing. A node or OpenVMS Cluster executing SLS for OpenVMS soft-
 ware provides media management services for itself and for any "client
 nodes" connected to it. At least one SLS for OpenVMS server license
 in the network is required for use of the SLS for OpenVMS product.

 SLS for OpenVMS VAX and Alpha Clients

 SLS for OpenVMS Client software provides backup scheduling and archiv-
 ing services for the node or OpenVMS Cluster on which it is execut-
 ing, and acts as a client of the SLS server software when the client
 requires media management services.

 Like the SLS Sever software, the SLS Client software maintains SLS his-
 tory files where it records information about user files backed up or
 archived locally under its control. The node executing SLS for Open-
 VMS client software communicates using DECnet or DECnet-Plus software
 to a node running the SLS for OpenVMS server software. The SLS server
 node maintains the SLS media database. The SLS media database contains
 information about volume location and pool access authorization.

 Each SLS for OpenVMS client node must be reached from a node or Open-
 VMS Cluster system executing the SLS for OpenVMS server software. Any
 number of SLS for OpenVMS client nodes may be served by a single SLS
 for OpenVMS server node.

 SLS ACS for OpenVMS VAX and Alpha Systems


                                  4

 

 SLS ACS for OpenVMS supports the StorageTek 4400 automated cartridge
 server. This license is required in order to interface the StorageTek
 ACS to SLS for OpenVMS. The SLS ACS license can run on either the SLS
 server or client system.

 Digital also strongly recommends that you order the Digital Cartridge
 Server Component(DCSC) V3.0 or newer software license for use with the
 StorageTek 4400 automated cartridge servers. Refer to the DCSC SPD (33.59.xx)
 for more information.

 Disk space required by the SLS for OpenVMS media database and history
 files:

 The SLS media database is present only on nodes executing SLS for Open-
 VMS server software (not on nodes executing SLS for OpenVMS client soft-
 ware). The disk space required by the SLS media database depends on
 the number of pieces of media to be managed. During installation, you
 may designate the disk on which the SLS media database will be kept.
 For enhanced data safety, the SLS media database may be stored on a
 shadowed disk.

 SLS history files are present on any node executing either SLS for Open-
 VMS server software or SLS for OpenVMS client software. The disk space
 required for a SLS history file depends upon the number of files to
 be tracked by SLS for OpenVMS software. During installation, you may
 designate the disk on which SLS history files are will be kept. For
 enhanced data safety, the SLS history files may be stored on a shad-
 owed disk.

 Total Disk Space Requirement for SLS for OpenVMS Server Software:

 Execution of SLS for OpenVMS Server software requires approximately
 8,400 blocks (the number of blocks occupied by SLS for OpenVMS and RDF
 software) plus one block for every piece of media it manages plus one
 block for every six files it tracks.

 Example: Assume that there are 1,500 pieces of media under management
 by SLS for OpenVMS software and that 60,000 files are tracked. The space
 required is:

 DEVICE SUPPORT

 The following libraries and loaders have been tested and qualified by
 Storage Management Software Engineering and they are supported by the
 Storage Management Software products using the common media manager
 (SLS, ABS, HSM and SMF). However, Storage Management Software Engi-
 neering does not test each of the devices with every possible combi-
 nation of controllers and host systems. Because the Storage Manage-
 ment Software products and the Media Robot Utility (MRU) run in com-
 mon environments, these combinations are tested first with MRU. Upon
 successful completion of the MRU tests, the storage management prod-
 ucts are then tested in representative configurations. Note that MRU
 is not a prerequisite for the Storage Management Software products.

 Therefore, to determine if your specific configuration is supported,
 follow these steps:

 1. If you have a tape drive that is not software-defined as a juke-
    box (is not a library or a loader device), reference the OpenVMS
    Software Product Description (SPD 25.01) to determine if your tape
    drive is supported for your platform and controller/adapter com-
    bination.

 2. If your device is software-defined as a jukebox (it is a library
    or loader device), first check the following list to determine if
    it is supported by the media manager. If the device is supported,
    see the following instructions:

    a. Check the OpenVMS Software Product Description (SPD 25.01) to
       make sure the tape drive(s) in your library/loader are supported
       for your platform and controller/adapter combination.

    b. Check the MRU Software Product Description (SPD 64.44) to make
       sure your library/loader is supported by MRU for your specific
       controller/adapter combination.

 3. Assuming your device is correctly connected and configured, it is
    fully supported by the common media manager and its clients.


                                 14

 

 If you have devices that are not shown on the list, they may still be
 supported. DIGITAL continually tests its software on additional de-
 vices that may have been released since the last publication of this
 SPD. If you have a question about a particular device, contact DIG-
 ITAL customer support.
