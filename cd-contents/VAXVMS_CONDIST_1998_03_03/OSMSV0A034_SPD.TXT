PRODUCT NAME:  DIGITAL Optical Storage Management      SPD 47.46.06
                Software (OSMS) for OpenVMS VAX and Alpha, 
                Version 3.4a

DESCRIPTION

The DIGITAL[TM] Optical Storage Management Software (DIGITAL OSMS) for
OpenVMS[TM] product provides OpenVMS applications and users the func-
tionality necessary to access an optical disk library (or jukebox) us-
ing the conventional device, file, and record access services provided
by the OpenVMS Operating System. In most cases, no changes will be re-
quired to existing applications that use magnetic disk storage.

The OpenVMS VAX[TM] and OpenVMS Alpha version of DIGITAL OSMS provides
local or VMScluster[TM] access to rewritable or WORM (Write Once, Read
Many) media containing FILES-11 on-disk structure by way of the RW5xx
series of optical libraries. DIGITAL OSMS for OpenVMS Alpha does not
support any configuration using WORM media containing the WORMS-11[R]
on-disk structure.

Pseudo-Device Representation

DIGITAL OSMS allows the OpenVMS host to view the optical library as
a virtual set of disk devices. This translates to one virtual disk de-
vice for each optical disk surface in the library. For example, the
DIGITAL RW531 optical library has two single-headed optical disk drives
and 32 optical disk cartridge storage slots. Each storage slot holds
one optical disk cartridge, so the library has the capacity of 64 op-
tical disk surfaces. The optical library, therefore, appears to ap-
plications as 64 virtual disk devices, named JBA0: through JBA63:. The
JB devices are not physical devices; they are called pseudo-devices.
Excluding those functions that are unique to the optical technology,

                                                          July 1997

 

these pseudo-devices emulate the operation of a conventional OpenVMS
magnetic disk.

Volume Access

Volumes in an optical library used with DIGITAL OSMS are accessed us-
ing the same techniques that are used to access conventional OpenVMS
disks. The standard OpenVMS INITIALIZE command is used to prepare each
side of an optical disk cartridge for use and the standard OpenVMS MOUNT
command is used to make the volume known to OpenVMS. WORM volumes can
only be "initialized" once, whereas rewritable volumes, like magnetic
disks, can be "initialized" multiple times. Once a volume has been mounted,
DIGITAL OSMS manages the use of the physical optical disk drives to
allow volumes to remain logically mounted regardless of where the vol-
ume is in the optical library.

File Access

Files on volumes under control of DIGITAL OSMS are accessed using the
same techniques that are used to access conventional OpenVMS files.
Once a volume has been mounted, files may be opened, read, written,
and closed using the conventional OpenVMS system services and run-time
library functions. WORM volumes use the WORMS-11 file system. Rewritable
volumes use the FILES-11 file system.

DIGITAL OSMS provides essentially transparent access using standard
OpenVMS commands and I/O statements from application programs. DIG-
ITAL OSMS supports all OpenVMS commands and their library routine equiv-
alents, such as, but not limited to:

ALLOCATE           DEALLOCATE      MOUNT
APPEND             DELETE[2]       OPEN
BACKUP[1]          DIFFERENCE      PURGE
CLOSE              DIRECTORY       READ
COPY               DISMOUNT        RENAME
___________________________________________________________________
[1]Not all backup options are supported using WORM media.

[2]This command can be used with WORM media but will not free up
additional disk space as with rewritable media.

CREATE             EDIT            WRITE
CREATE             INITIALIZE[3]
/DIRECTORY
___________________________________________________________________
[3]This command can be used only once with WORM media.

SYSTEM MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS

The management utility tool, JBUTIL, lets the system manager control
the parameters affecting the operation of the optical library. The util-
ity also allows cartridges to be loaded into and removed from the op-
tical library. Once a cartridge has been placed in a storage slot in-
side the optical library, it will remain associated with the corre-
sponding JBxx: device destination until the cartridge is removed from
the optical library using JBUTIL.

The ODUTIL utility is provided for analyzing and recovering lost files
on WORM media - for VAX systems only. The ODUTIL utility lets the user:

o  Recover files that have been "lost" on a WORMS-11 optical disk; that
   is, files that still exist on the disk but are not entered into any
   directory.

o  Display the number of allocated blocks in all files currently vis-
   ible (not deleted) on the disk volume.

o  Analyze and repair the file structure of a WORMS-11 optical disk
   by correcting the pointer that describes the next free block to use
   on the optical disk.

o  Recreate corrupted directories and restore the required files into
   the directory.

Some of these functions were provided by the ODRECOVER and ODANALYZE
utilities in previous releases.

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

The person planning a system configuration must understand the hard-
ware requirements of the complete system. Due to the variety of pro-
cessors that support OpenVMS and the length of time that some Open-
VMS systems have been in service, there exist a huge combination of
processor, SCSI adapter/controller, and optical subsystem combinations.
Some combinations are not supported. For example, the VAX 6000, 7000,
8000, and 10000 series processors are only supported when the opti-
cal library is connected to an HSD or HSJ controller.

[1]1 block = 512 bytes

[2]DIGITAL OSMS uses one cache file per optical storage volume.
As a result, volume caching options selected at installation can
result in disk requirements ranging from 4 additional blocks to
cache one optical disk volume to 15,597,092 additional blocks -
the_maximum_allowable_cache_for_476_optical_disk_volumes.__________

These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. Ad-
ditional disk space can be required based on the user's system envi-
ronment and configuration, as well as the user options selected at in-
stallation time.

The minimum memory supported is 16 Mbytes for VAX systems and 32 Mbytes
for Alpha systems. The use of this software in conjunction with in-
creased memory capability improves performance. The memory size sug-
gested for most typical VAX hardware configurations is at least 32 Mbytes.

SOFTWARE LICENSING

This software is furnished under the licensing provisions of DIGITAL
Equipment Corporation's Standard Terms and Conditions. For more in-
formation about DIGITAL licensing terms and policies, contact your lo-
cal DIGITAL office.

License Management Facility Support

DIGITAL OSMS for OpenVMS supports the OpenVMS License Management Fa-
cility.

License units for DIGITAL OSMS for OpenVMS VAX and Alpha are allocated
to a single 5.25-inch optical library based on the size and slot ca-
pacity of the optical library. The license is based on unlimited sys-
tem use.

Upgrade license units for DIGITAL OSMS for OpenVMS VAX and Alpha are
used in conjunction with a hardware upgrade of the applicable opti-
cal libraries and are added to the original license to provide a to-
tal equal to the combined units of the original license plus the up-
grade license.

For more information on the License Management Facility, refer to the
OpenVMS VAX Operating System Software Product Description (SPD 25.01.xx)
or the OpenVMS Alpha Operating System Software Product Description (SPD
41.87.xx), or the License Management Facility manual of the appropri-
ate version (VAX or Alpha) of the OpenVMS Operating System documen-
tation sets.
