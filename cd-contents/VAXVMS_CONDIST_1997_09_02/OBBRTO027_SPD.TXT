         PRODUCT NAME: ObjectBroker for OpenVMS, Version 2.7          SPD

         44.12.04

         DESCRIPTION

         ObjectBroker for OpenVMS (VAX and Alpha) Version 2.7 provides ap-
         plication developers and system integrators with the development tools
         and run-time environments to integrate applications and services dis-
         tributed across UNIX[R] environments (Digital UNIX [TM]), SunOS[TM],
         Solaris[TM], HP-UX[R], IBM[R] AIX[R]), Microsoft[R], Windows 95[R],
         Windows[TM], and Windows NT[TM] (Alpha and Intel[TM]).

         ObjectBroker Version 2.7 is Digital's implementation of the Object
         Management Group's (OMG[R]) Common Object Request Broker Architecture
         (CORBA[TM]) specification V1.2 and V2.0 for enterprise wide produc-
         tion use. ObjectBroker also extends Microsoft OLE technology to a
         multiplatform distributed computing environment.

         ObjectBroker simplifies distributed application development by pro-
         viding platform-independent, client/server, programming interfaces.
         It offers an object-oriented (O-O) approach to dynamic linking of
         independently developed applications and services. ObjectBroker al-
         lows application processes to transparently invoke, control, and in-
         teract with each other across multiple platforms.

         Features

         o  A high-level, standards-based application programming interface
            (API) across 15 platforms.

         o  Compliance with OMG's CORBA specification, protecting users' soft-
            ware development investments.

         o  C++ language bindings provide C++ programmers a natural inter-
            face as defined in CORBA Specification Version 2.0. C program-
            ming language and Visual Basic bindings continue to be supported.

                                                            November 1996

         ObjectBroker for OpenVMS, Version 2.7              SPD 44.12.04


         o  Integration with Kerberos/DCE Security for optional integration
            of secure client and server applications on Windows NT and Digital
            UNIX.

         o  Support for the CORBA V2.0 Initialization Service.

         o  ObjectBroker COSS Naming implementation has become invokable, al-
            lowing users to replace it with one of their choosing.

         o  OLE Integration (known as the OLE Portal) and DDE Integration (known
            as the DDE Listener) provide the ability for shrink-wrapped and
            custom desktop applications, that comply with the Microsoft OLE
            and DDE interfaces, to communicate with certain remote ObjectBroker
            servers. Developers can use the OLE Portal and DDE Listener fea-
            tures today to begin moving toward open client/server environ-
            ments.

         o  Script servers allow client access to existing applications us-
            ing command line interfaces, with no source changes necessary,
            facilitating the migration to client/server computing.

         o  O-O abstraction provides insulation of clients and servers from
            changes in network topology or application code through the use
            of implementation-independent brokering services.

         o  QuickStart makes it easier for new users to get an application
            up and running, as well as making experienced users more produc-
            tive.

         o  A new Server Management API to enables system managers to man-
            age servers through a callable API.

         ObjectBroker for OpenVMS Capabilities

         ObjectBroker V2.7 is a software product that enables client and server
         applications, on different computer systems, to communicate over a
         network. Each message between the client and server is called a re-
         quest and the process of sending a request is called invocation.

         Client Application

         The client application sends a request, possibly over a network, for
         an operation to be performed. The request is performed by an imple-
         mentation within a server application.

         Server Application

                                        2

 



         ObjectBroker for OpenVMS, Version 2.7              SPD 44.12.04


         The server application contains implementations that satisfy client
         requests when they are received. The server application returns in-
         formation back to the client application.

         ORB

         The Object Request Broker (ORB) provides functions specific to the
         client and to the server. A client request first goes to the ORB,
         which is the primary mechanism that ObjectBroker uses to locate 
	 ObjectBroker implementations on the network.

         The server-side ORB answers requests from clients and dispatches them
         to the appropriate server application.

         Agent

         The agent is the entity provided as part of ObjectBroker V2.7 that
         performs services on behalf of a user in the context of ObjectBroker.
         An agent must be present on any computer that supports applications
         that provide services using ObjectBroker. The agent maintains a list
         of active servers on the computer and can automatically start new
         servers if needed to respond to client requests.

         A new function, Proxy Failure Log, has been added to ObjectBroker
         V2.7. This function provides the ObjectBroker agent with the abil-
         ity to record certain types of security failures in the agent log
         file.

         Repository

         The ObjectBroker repository contains definitions of ObjectBroker in-
         terfaces and their associated implementations. An ObjectBroker in-
         terface is the set of operations and attributes that can be performed
         on a object. An implementation contains the code that satisfies a
         client request for operations on a specific object.

         The interface repository also contains method maps, which describe
         the criteria by which to select implementations. The interface def-
         initions in the Interface Repository are written in OMG IDL, which
         is described in the CORBA specification and in the ObjectBroker doc-
         umentation.

         Context Object

         A context object contains information about a user's preferences,
         which are taken into account during the resolution process, and ad-
         ditional properties and values which are propagated to the server
         side during an invocation request. In addition, applications can store
         profile information in the context object that is not used as res-
         olution criteria.

         Script Server

         The script server is a special ObjectBroker server process which al-
         lows legacy applications to be encapsulated as object implementa-
         tions. The script server allows applications that export a command
         line interface to be used as object implementations. Client appli-
         cations have no knowledge that an object's implementation is actu-
         ally implemented as a script.

         Registry

         ObjectBroker for OpenVMS, Version 2.7              SPD 44.12.04


         The ObjectBroker registry stores information outside of user appli-
         cations, that is used by all of the components of ObjectBroker.

         The configuration partition of the registry contains information about
         the configuration of ObjectBroker on a given computer, including the
         list of available transports and the authentication package to be
         used.

         The security partition of the registry contains information about
         a user's authorization to access specific implementations and meth-
         ods. Along with authorization information for users, the security
         registry also contains information that describes the list of re-
         mote users that are allowed to access ObjectBroker on the current
         computer

         The advertisement partition of the registry stores information about
         servers, where to find them, and what they provide.

         The implementation partition of the registry contains information
         about object implementations that have been installed on the com-
         puter. At a minimum, the implementation registry contains the unique
         identifier of the implementation, the operating system specific com-
         mand for starting the server process that contains the implementa-
         tion code, and the list of attributes to be defined as environment
         variables when the process that executes the implementation is started.

         Developer's Features

         The ObjectBroker product contains many functions to aid in program
         development. There are utilities to generate code for the client and
         server applications, utilities to define and manage security and en-
         vironmental settings, and utilities to support other products and
         their interface to ObjectBroker.

         For code generation, ObjectBroker utilizes a language to describe
         the interfaces of your distributed application. ObjectBroker util-
         ities use this language to generate code and other definitions used
         at run-time.

         Developer's features include the following:

         o  ObjectBroker V2.7 implements the CORBA 2.0 standard for allow-
            ing an application to initialize itself into an ORB environment.


                                        5

 



         ObjectBroker for OpenVMS, Version 2.7              SPD 44.12.04


         o  CORBAservices naming service is implemented as an invocable server.
            This makes it possible for customers to replace the CORBAservices
            Naming Service implementation supplied with ObjectBroker with-
            out relinking the client.

         o  OMG Interface Definition Language (IDL) for describing classes
            and messages

         o  Support for User Defined Types (UDT)

         o  Generation of client-side stubs for operations defined on one or
            more interfaces:

            -  Static interfaces use code skeletons (stubs) containing rou-
               tines that cannot be changed. Stubs provide a linear inter-
               face and reduce the complexity of the method resolution.

            -  Dynamic interfaces use routines that the client defines and
               builds as it is running. The dynamic interface provides client
               with more flexibility to use deferred synchronous operations,
               different method maps, and new interfaces.

         o  Generation of OMG IDL skeletons (dispatchers), registration rou-
            tines, and method routine stubs for servers

         o  Support for the Dynamic Invocation Interface (DII) routines

         Additionally, ObjectBroker provides utilities to manage the secu-
         rity settings and the overall environment. These utility functions
         are available as command-line functions as well as through graph-
         ical user interface utilities (GUIs).

         Digital Extensions to the CORBA specification provide enhanced
         capabilities. These extensions include:

         Languages

         o  The Implementation Language (IML) describes methods and their
            implementations.

         o  The Method Mapping Language (MML) maps operations to the
            methods that implement them.

         QuickStart is a new code generation facility. It is a prototyp-
         ing tool that allows a user to take an OMG IDL file and generate
         code for the client, server, methods, make files and more.
         QuickStart reduces the complexity and time to create a running
         ObjectBroker client/server application and is particularly

                                        6

 



         ObjectBroker for OpenVMS, Version 2.7              SPD 44.12.04


         useful for evaluators to test their IDL and showcase ORB
         functionality.

         Improved System Management makes it possible for a system
         manager to monitor the state of server applications within a
         distributed production environment through a callable API. This
         facilitates integration with other management tools or products.

         ObjectBroker Graphical User Interface Utilities provide a
         fully supported, windowed set of utilities that help system
         integrators manage the CORBA environment and programmers develop
         new distributed applications. The utilities provide interfaces
         that:

         o  View and manipulate context objects, repositories, and remote
            servers

         o  Generate code for programmers

         o  Set up the environment (security, proxies, transport)

         The user interface of each utility is based on CORBA concepts.
         The utility's interface is native to the platform on which it is
         executing (Motif[R], Windows).

         OLE and DDE

         ObjectBroker Version 2.7 works cooperatively with Microsoft's
         Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) to provide a network
         "portal" from Microsoft Windows platforms to ObjectBroker server
         platforms. ObjectBroker applications on UNIX and OpenVMS systems
         can be made OLE-aware (by implementing a set of pre-defined OLE
         methods shipped with ObjectBroker) and will respond to requests
         from OLE applications on Microsoft Windows.

         The ObjectBroker OLE Portal processes OLE API calls on Window
         Systems and maps them to messages. These messages are then
         sent to an appropriate ObjectBroker server on the network for
         resolution. From a user's perspective, the mapping process
         is transparent. Within an OLE application, the OLE Portal
         appears as another local OLE server application, which can be
         expanded to a window to display OLE-aware applications/servers
         on the network. Information from sources across the network
         can be linked or embedded into desktop applications through
         ObjectBroker. The ObjectBroker OLE portal employs OLE Version

                                        7

 



         ObjectBroker for OpenVMS, Version 2.7              SPD 44.12.04


         2.0 interfaces and also provides support for OLE Version 1.0
         applications.

         ObjectBroker extends the Microsoft Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)
         communication protocol to allow Microsoft Windows applications
         on a networked PC to interact using DDE with applications
         running on, Solaris, SunOS, IBM AIX, HP-UX, OpenVMS and
         Digital UNIX. Applications can function as DDE clients or
         servers. DDE support in ObjectBroker allows two Microsoft
         applications to communicate on different PCs. Transports

         ObjectBroker supports PATHWORKS TCP/IP, Novell[R] TCP/IP,
         TCPware[R], DEC TCP/IP Services and PATHWORKS DECnet IV network
         transports. In addition, ObjectBroker uses the Winsocket Version
         1.1.1 interface to PATHWORKS TCP/IP and Novell TCP/IP,and
         may work with other WinSock-compliant TCP/IP transports
         implementations. However, no others have been tested nor are
         they supported at this time.

         Multiple Simultaneous Transports

         ObjectBroker V2.7 supports multiple network transports on a
         single system; each transport can run concurrently. A client
         running TCP/IP and DECnet can communicate with a server that is
         running either TCP/IP, DECnet, or both. The system administrator
         controls which transports are available to client and server
         applications on each system. The platforms that support multiple
         simultaneous transports are OpenVMS (VAX and Alpha), Microsoft
         Windows and Windows NT (Intel and Alpha).

         Network Tester

         The network tester utility provides the ability to determine
         whether the network is properly configured for use with
         ObjectBroker. A user can specify the amount of data to be
         sent between a network tester client and server. This tool also
         provides detailed error messages when failures occur. The user
         can test ObjectBroker and the network between two computers
         without having to write an ObjectBroker test program.

	 Load Balancing

         ObjectBroker allows you to associate descriptive attributes
         to server applications so that clients can select a particular
         server application based on those attributes. ObjectBroker also
         provides a means of balancing the load among multiple copies of
         a server application on a given computer.
