        1 Description

              DECnet-Plus Version 7.1 for OpenVMS VAX (formerly known
              as DECnet/OSI) is an implementation of Phase V of the
              Digital Network Architecture (DNA) for the OpenVMS VAX
              operating system. DECnet-Plus integrates DECnet and
              Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) network protocols,
              allowing both stacks to share integrated network
              functions up to the Transport layer. Upper layers have
              been implemented as separate towers, allowing existing
              DECnet and OSI applications to share the integrated
              Transport layer. Existing DECnet Phase IV and new DECnet
              and OSI applications are supported by DECnet-Plus. In
              combination with TCP/IP protocol stacks, OpenVMS systems
              can participate in multivendor, multiprotocol networks
              adhering to open networking standards.

              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS features include:

              o  The ability to run DECnet and OSI applications over
                 TCP/IP transports.

              o  Continued support for 32-bit network applications.

              o  Host-based routing, which includes communication with
                 nodes running DECnet Phase IV and OSI protocols, FDDI
                 large packets, and X.25 switched and permanent virtual
                 circuits.

              o  FAST configuration option, which allows quick
                 configuration upgrades from Phase IV to Phase V.

              o  X.25 network management interface, providing efficient
                 wide area network (WAN) management.

              o  The ability to configure all members of a cluster from
                 any cluster member.

              o  The ability to generate an OpenVMS audit event when a
                 connection is established.

              o  OSI application programming interfaces (APIs).

                                                                       1

 






              o  Expanded naming options, allowing the use of a larger
                 Local namespace, DECdns, and/or DNS/BIND as naming
                 services.

              o  Routing segregated mode to allow the Routing layer to
                 choose a Phase IV router for those packets having a
                 Phase IV compatible address. (Packets having a Phase
                 V extended address are sent to a Phase V router by
                 default.) This is a configurable option.

              o  Reverse path caching to capture path information for
                 later use in reaching remote systems.

              o  Increased network size, supported through the use of
                 ISO OSI addressing.

              o  Simplified installation and configuration process.

              o  The Network Control Language (NCL). Network management
                 is based on DNA CMIP, Digital's implementation of
                 the OSI international standard Common Management
                 Information Protocol.

              o  A graphical network management user interface,
                 net$mgmt, for improved network management, using NCL.

              o  An NCP (Network Control Program) emulator to facilitate
                 installation of layered products written for DECnet
                 Phase IV.

              o  Installation using the POLYCENTER Software Installation
                 utility.

              o  Support for topologies using multicircuit and
                 multihomed end nodes.

              o  Dynamic connections over X.25 networks.

        DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS includes OSI implementation in
        accordance with current U.S. and U.K. GOSIP requirements:

              o  Application, Presentation, and Session layers

                 -  File Transfer, Access, and Management (FTAM)
                    application

                 -  Virtual Terminal application

                 -  Applicaton Service Elements (ASEs), including ACSE
                    (Association Control Service Element)

        2

 






              o  Transport layer classes 0, 2, and 4

              o  Lower layers

                 -  OSI addressing formats, supporting large network
                    topologies

                 -  End system to intermediate system (ES-IS) routing

                 -  Connectionless Mode Network Service (CLNS) over
                    local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN),
                    and X.25

                 -  Logical Link Control type 2 (LLC2) for Connection-
                    Oriented Network Service (CONS) over LAN

                 -  Data Link layer, supporting High-level Data Link
                    Control (HDLC) for wide area communications, ISO
                    8802-3 (Ethernet CSMA/CD) and FDDI LANs, and DDCMP
                    for backwards compatibility. HDLC support includes
                    the LAPB (Link Access Protocol Balanced) protocol
                    for X.25 communications.

                 -  Physical layer, with CSMA/CD, HDLC, and FDDI devices
                    supported.

              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS offers task-to-task communica-
              tions, file management, downline system and task loading,
              network command terminals, and network resource sharing
              capabilities using DNA, OSI, and TCP/IP protocols.
              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS communicates with adjacent and
              non-adjacent DECnet Phase IV, PATHWORKS, DECnet-Plus
              implementations on other OpenVMS systems, ULTRIX, and
              Digital UNIX systems, as well as systems running TCP
              /IP transports and on OSI-compliant systems from other
              vendors.

              OpenVMS programs written in native-mode programming
              languages can use DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS capabilities.

              Depending on the system configuration, networks combining
              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS systems with other DECnet, OSI,
              and TCP/IP products may limit the functions available if
              all products do not support equal features.

                                                                       3

 






        1.1 Data Link Layer

              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS uses asynchronous, Ethernet and
              FDDI communications controllers to interface with other
              network nodes.

              LAN connectivity is provided by the CSMA/CD and FDDI
              controllers and drivers supporting ISO 8802-2 Logical
              Link Control (LLC) Type 1 connectionless service and ISO
              8802-3 LLC Type 2. DECnet-Plus also supports Ethernet
              Version 2 packet formats on CSMA/CD devices.

              Use of FDDI packets larger than 1500 bytes requires a
              Phase V router on the FDDI LAN. As with cluster alias
              support, you can configure the Phase V router to run the
              Phase IV distance vector routing protocol or the Phase V
              link state routing protocol.

              Supported synchronous devices allow for the use of DDCMP,
              Digital HDLC, LAPB/E and SDLC protocols. BISYNC and
              GENBYTE protocols are also supported on some options.
              WAN device drivers are required by X.25 to establish
              host-based wide area connections.

              Synchronous controllers use DDCMP or HDLC, when connected
              either directly or through modems, to provide full- or
              half-duplex communications over point-to-point lines.
              Synchronous DDCMP multipoint tributary connections are
              also supported. Asynchronous controllers use DDCMP, when
              connected either directly or through modems, to provide
              only full duplex communications over point-to-point lines.
              Error correcting and data suppression modems are not
              supported.

              Asynchronous lines are supported only to other systems
              running DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS VAX, DECnet-VAX, DECnet-
              RSX, and DECnet-DOS.

              DDCMP operation is not supported in cases where an
              asynchronous physical communications line is emulated
              by lower-level protocols or communications subsystems.
              Examples of this include X.29 Virtual Terminals,
              asynchronous connections as emulated by terminal servers,
              and connections through data switches.

              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS allows up to four circuits to be
              defined and operational on an end system. This capability
              allows a single end system to be connected to up to
              four separate LANs or WANs. Digital recommends that the
              circuits be equal in capacity and connectivity.

        1.2 X.25

              The DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS VAX license includes the
              right to use X.25 Access software, formerly known as VAX
              P.S.I. Access. The right to use X.25 Native Mode software,
              formerly known as VAX P.S.I., requires an additional
              license. See the Optional Software section of this SPD for
              ordering information. The X.25 software in DECnet-Plus for
              OpenVMS is backward compatible with systems running the
              older X.25 Native Mode products. Applications written to
              the older X.25 interfaces will continue to run, unchanged,
              with the X.25 software supported on DECnet-Plus.

              The X.25 Native Mode software allows suitably configured
              DECnet-Plus systems to connect to PSDNs that conform
              to CCITT recommendation X.25 (1980 or 1984) and/or to
              International Standards (ISO) 7776 and 8208. This allows a
              DECnet-Plus system to function as data terminal equipment
              (DTE) or be addressed as data circuit terminating
              equipment (DCE) as follows:

              o  A packet-mode DTE connected to a supported PSDN
                 (supported PSDNs are listed in Table 5) conforming
                 to CCITT Recommendation X.25 (1980, 1984)

              o  A packet-mode DTE connected to a CSMA/CD LAN conforming
                 to ISO 8802-3 using ISO Logical Link Control Type 2
                 (LLC2) as specified in ISO 8881

              o  A packet-mode DTE/DCE connected to a DCE/DTE conforming
                 to ISO 7776 and 8208

        You can configure X.25 for native operation to support direct
        connections from a VAX system to one or more PSDNs, each of
        which may have one or more DTEs. The software also allows
        communication with any non-Digital X.25 system on the same
        LAN that supports the ISO Logical Link Control Type 2 (LLC2)
        protocol.

                                                                       5

 






              Direct access to a PSDN (using the supported device
              drivers) requires an X.25 license. See the Optional
              Software section.

              X.25 Access Software

              The X.25 Access software uses a connector node to provide
              the physical connection to a PSDN. A connector node can
              be an X25Router 2000 (SPD 28.86.xx), a DEC X.25gateway
              100/500 (SPD 32.97.xx), a DECNIS router (SPD 36.95.xx), or
              other similar routers.

              DECnet-Plus logical links are established by OpenVMS to
              connect the X.25 Access system to the X.25 Connector
              system. These links may use any supported DECnet-Plus
              communications path between the X.25 Access system and
              the Connector system, provided they do not use an X.25
              connection. X.25 Access uses these links to transmit X.25
              or X.29 messages between the Connector system and the X.25
              Access system.

              Note that successful use of an X.29 connection, either
              for incoming X.29 calls or by means of the host-based
              PAD (packet assembler/disassembler) utility supplied with
              X.25 Access, depends on the DECnet-Plus circuit between
              the Access and Connector system having a low response
              time. This configuration requires high-speed DECnet-Plus
              connections and few intermediate routing systems.

              A single X.25 Access system can connect to one or more
              Connector systems concurrently, and hence access all
              PSDN(s) accessible from those Connector systems. When
              X.25 Access is used, one of these Connector systems/PSDN
              combinations must be established as the default gateway
              for outbound and inbound traffic.

              Features

              The X.25 software provides the Connection-Oriented Network
              Service (CONS) to allow mapping between a destination NSAP
              address and a destination DTE address according to ISO
              8348.

              The X.25 software can be used in the following ways:

              o  Process-to-process (X.25) communications

              o  Process-to-terminal (X.29) communications

        6

 






              o  Terminal-to-process (X.29) communications

              Process-to-Process (X.25) Communications

              The X.25 software provides access for OpenVMS user
              programs written in VAX MACRO and high-level languages
              such as VAX FORTRAN. The X.25 software does not support
              programs executing in PDP-11 compatibility mode.

              The X.25 programming interface allows application programs
              to access the service interface to the packet level by
              means of the standard OpenVMS QIO interface. Functions
              include setting up and breaking network connections,
              data transmission and reception, sending and receiving
              interrupt messages, and resetting virtual circuits. The
              interface allows splitting and recombining of messages
              that are longer than the packet size selected for the
              circuit.

              The X.25 programming interface enables an application
              program using OpenVMS system services to communicate
              with complementary software on other systems (Digital or
              non-Digital DTEs) accessible through the X.25 connection.

              Process-to-Terminal and Terminal-to-Process (X.29)
              Communications

              The X.25 software supports terminal communications
              according to CCITT recommendations X.3, X.28, and X.29
              for outgoing and incoming terminal traffic.

              X.25 native users may make outgoing calls to other Digital
              or non-Digital CPUs, or suitable network PADs accessible
              through a PSDN, using the X.29 programming interface or
              by using the host-based PAD. The PAD facility accepts
              DCL-style commands or CCITT X.28 commands.

              The X.29 interactive terminal interface allows remote
              asynchronous terminals (character-mode DTEs) connected
              to the network to communicate with the X.25 host in a
              manner similar to local terminals. Dissimilarities might
              appear as a result of delays caused by the PSDN(s) and
              the various PAD parameter settings chosen by the user or
              peculiar to the PSDN(s). In this case, the remote PAD must
              convert code between ASCII and the code the terminal uses.
              Note that there may be some restrictions imposed by the
              PSDN(s).

                                                                       7

 






              Terminal parameters defined in the X.3 recommendation are
              supported explicitly. Network-specific enhancements or
              extensions to the X.3 parameters are available at both
              the X.29 programming interface and the host-based PAD
              user interface. Terminal processes that depend on these
              extensions might cause problems when used on other PSDNs
              or when accessing one PSDN through another (for example,
              international access).

              The X.29 terminal interface is compatible with the local
              terminal interface, except for those facilities where the
              PSDN does not provide adequate support. The X.29 interface
              includes support for specific X.29 signaling.

              The host-based PAD employs a DCL-style command syntax,
              offering the ability to reference the CCITT PAD parameters
              symbolically, as well as an interface that conforms to the
              standard CCITT command signals. The host-based PAD also
              offers the capability of running multiple X.29 sessions
              using the OpenVMS SPAWN and ATTACH commands. The host-
              based PAD supports reception of reselection messages to
              allow X.29 calls to be redirected to another DTE.

              The X.29 programming interface is similar to the X.25
              one and allows an OpenVMS process to control the virtual
              circuit (for example, to modify PAD parameters or clear
              a call). You can also use the X.29 programming interface
              to make an outgoing call to a remote PAD. The programming
              interface allows generation of PAD reselection messages.

              The maximum number of terminals supported (both local
              and remote X.29) must not exceed the number supported by
              OpenVMS. The use of PVCs (permanent virtual circuits) for
              X.29 connections is not defined by the 1980, 1984, and
              1988 CCITT Recommendations and is not supported.

              Static X.25 Circuits

              X.25 allows the use of DECnet-Plus facilities over static
              X.25 circuits. These circuits are called statically
              assigned circuits.

              X.25 native software supports both permanent virtual
              circuits (PVCs) and switched virtual circuits (SVCs).
              One virtual circuit is used for each:

              o  Incoming or outgoing X.29 terminal connection

              o  X.25 connection, using either a SVC or PVC

        X.25 native supports a maximum of 4,096 virtual circuits per
        system.

              X.25 Access supports a maximum of 900 virtual circuits per
              system.

              Note that each virtual circuit requires a certain amount
              of memory so the number of logical virtual circuits
              possible on any single system is limited by the available
              memory.

              Configuration

              The X.25 software includes a configuration procedure to
              configure a VAX system. This menu-based interface allows
              network managers to create an initialization script to
              configure entities and their attributes after initial
              installation.

              X.25 Accounting

              The X.25 Accounting utility enables the system manager to
              obtain information PSDN usage. X.25 Accounting can extract
              the information collected and display the information
              directly on a terminal or write the information to a file.
              It can also extract information for selected records,
              or produce a summary. The X.25 Accounting utility is
              compatible with the OpenVMS Accounting utility.

              For incoming X.29 calls, no information about the process
              /account on to which a user is logged can be stored.
              However this information may be obtained by correlation
              with OpenVMS accounting records.

              X.25 Security

              X.25 security allows control of both remote DTE access to
              the X.25 software, and access to the PSDN(s) by OpenVMS
              processes. X.25 security allows for access control on the
              basis of:

                                                                       9

 






              o  The remote DTE numbers involved, either on the basis of
                 individual DTE numbers or groups of DTE numbers with
                 common leading digits.

              o  The process making the outgoing call or the application
                 handling the incoming call.

              X.25 Mail

              The X.25 Mail utility allows communications through
              electronic mail between two OpenVMS systems running the
              X.25 software in native or in access mode. Refer to the
              OpenVMS Operating System SPD 25.01.xx for more information
              about OpenVMS Mail.

              Synchronous Communications Devices

              The X.25 Native Mode software supports the synchronous
              communications devices listed in the Communications
              Devices section, Table 3. The devices are different in
              many respects, particularly in the amount of CPU used.
              For optimum performance, Digital recommends the use of a
              direct memory access (DMA) device.

              Line Interfaces

              The electrical line interface used for PSDN communications
              depends on the hardware device used. X.25 Native Mode
              software provides only the electrical interface of a DTE
              rather than a DCE, and does not provide clock signals.
              Therefore, an external clock source (for example, a modem)
              is required.

              The range of supported synchronous communications devices
              covers V.24, V.35 and V.10, RS232, RS422 and RS423
              interfaces over point-to-point, 4-wire, synchronous, full-
              duplex lines at transmission rates up to 256K bits per
              second.

              Prerequisite Support

              For new PSDNs, the customer and Digital should jointly
              prepare a Network Profile and Customer Support Plan
              covering all the intended network systems, their usage
              of SVCs, PVCs, and other network facilities, and their
              support. Without this Network Profile and Customer Support
              Plan, Digital cannot support the network connections.

              Optional Facility Support

              Support for any given CCITT X.25 facility depends on
              support for it in the appropriate supported PSDN.
              Generally, X.25 software is designed to disallow use of
              facilities that the PSDN does not support. Table 1 shows
              the options that X.25 is capable of supporting, rather
              than what X.25 actually supports when used on a particular
              PSDN. The X.25 product documentation describes specific
              facility availability for the supported public PSDNs.

              __________________________________________________________

              The X.25 software does not support the following items of
              the CCITT X.25 recommendation:

              o  Multi-link protocol

              o  Use of the D-bit in outgoing packets

        Wide Area Network (WAN) Device Drivers

              The WAN device drivers included in DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS
              VAX support synchronous communications. The device drivers
              all offer a supported user ($QIO) interface.

              The device drivers all support full-duplex and half-
              duplex operation, where appropriate to the protocol.
              DDCMP and SDLC device drivers support both point-to-point
              and multipoint tributary operation. `BISYNC' refers to
              the IBM implementation of bisynchronous protocol. The
              GENBYTE protocol is a general byte-oriented protocol for
              use with user-written framing routines on some of the
              device drivers.

              The maximum permitted line speed depends on the line
              interface standard used and must not exceed 19.29 Kbits
              /second for an RS232 V.24 standard interface. There may
              be additional line speed restrictions for other line
              interface standards. For more information, refer to
              the SPDs for the synchronous interfaces. The Digital
              communications layered products may not necessarily
              support operation of the synchronous interface at the
              maximum speed supported by the device driver. Refer to the

        14

 






              appropriate Software Product Description for the Digital
              communications layered product for precise details of
              supported configurations.

              In all cases, the data throughput over the synchronous
              lines is dependent on the user applications and system
              environment.

              The device drivers support modem control signal operation.
              Refer to the product descriptions for the appropriate
              synchronous interface for details of the modem signals
              supported by an individual device.

              Supported controllers are listed in the Communications
              Devices section, Table 3.

              WAN device drivers include a pseudodriver (WANDRIVER) that
              provides a programming interface to the Data Link level
              for the LAPB, DEC-HDLC, and DDCMP protocols.

        1.3 Network Layer

              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS supports the Connectionless-Mode
              Network Service (CLNS) and the Connection-Oriented Network
              Service (CONS).

              Exchange of routing information between end systems and
              routers uses the ISO 9542 ES-IS routing protocol. This
              protocol allows DECnet-Plus systems to autoconfigure as
              end systems with ISO 9542-conformant routers.

              Addresses conform to the ISO 8348 Addendum 2 specifica-
              tion, allowing the support of large network topologies. As
              long as the system address stays within the addressing
              range of Phase IV systems (up to 1,023 systems per
              area and up to 63 areas per network), and uses the same
              initial domain part (IDP), you can use Phase IV or Phase V
              routers.

              The Network layer supports the capability of an end system
              to be multicircuited and multihomed. Multicircuit support
              allows multiple circuits to be active simultaneously.
              This functionality increases network reliability and data
              throughput. Multihomed end-system support allows a system
              to have up to three network entity titles.

                                                                      15

 






              Segregated routing mode is a settable attribute. It
              directs routing to choose a Phase IV router for those
              packets having a destination address that can be
              translated to the Phase IV format. All other packets are
              sent to a Phase V router, if available.

              The Routing layer is able to cache information about the
              paths that are used to reach remote nodes.


        1.4 Transport Layer

              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS provides support for:

              o  OSI Transport protocol as specified in ISO 8073

              o  RFC 1006 and RFC 1859 to allow DECnet and OSI
                 applications to run over TCP/IP

              o  Network Services Protocol (NSP)

        NSP, RFC 1006, and OSI transports support communications
        between DECnet, TCP/IP, and OSI systems. NSP provides backward
        compatibility with Phase IV DECnet systems.

              RFC 1859 support for DECnet applications is provided
              by a kernel interface that is implemented on all TCP/IP
              stacks available for use on the OpenVMS operating system.
              The supported applications include all licensed DECnet
              applications as well as layered products and user-
              written applications that conform to the documented DECnet
              programming interfaces.

              The RFC 1859 is a specification for running OSI appli-
              cations over TCP/IP. Operation of the FTAM and Virtual
              Terminal applications over a TCP/IP network is supported
              along with other layered OSI applications such as X.400
              and X.500.

              A separate TCP/IP stack is required on the same system
              with DECnet-Plus. See the Optional Software section of
              this SPD for information on supported TCP/IP products.

              OSI transport supports transport classes 0, 2, and 4 on
              connection-oriented networks and class 4 on connectionless
              networks.

              OSI transport uses two types of network service:

              o  The Connectionless-Mode Network Service (CLNS) using
                 the Internet protocol (ISO 8473) and ES-IS protocol
                 (ISO 9542) to communicate across linked subnetworks.
                 The inactive subset of ISO 8473 (null internet) is also
                 supported for communications over a single ISO 8802-3
                 local area network.

              o  The Connection-Oriented Network Service (CONS).

        1.5 Upper Layers

              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS software provides the OSI upper
              layer stack consisting of Session, Presentation and
              Application layers. The Application layer provides
              Association Control Service Element (ACSE); File Transfer,
              Management, and Access (FTAM); and Virtual Terminal (VT).

              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS also provides a range of DECnet
              applications and services including file and record
              access, remote terminal access, mail, and phone.

        2 Applications

              Transport Options for Applications

              You can run applications written to the DECnet upper
              layers over NSP, OSI, or TCP/IP transports using RFC 1006
              and RFC 1859. This includes the network applications
              that are licensed with DECnet-Plus as well as user-
              written applications that adhere to the documented DECnet
              programming interfaces. The use of TCP/IP transports using
              RFC 1006 and RFC 1859 does not require any modification to
              the existing application.

              You can run applications written to the OSI upper layers
              over OSI or TCP/IP transports.

              Remote File Transfer

              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS supports two upper layer protocols
              for remote file transfer: the OSI protocol's File
              Transfer, Access, and Management (FTAM) and the DECnet
              Data Access Protocol (DAP).

              FTAM

                                                                      17

 






              FTAM supports file transfer, access, and management
              between a DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS system and other systems
              with software adhering to ISO 8571. In addition, FTAM is
              conformant with NIST Phase II and Phase III agreements
              and is certified as being conformant to the released
              specifications of U.S. GOSIP, U.K. GOSIP, and ENV41204.

              In addition, FTAM:

              o  Provides users the ability to create, delete, rename,
                 view, and copy files using DCL commands.

              o  Is implemented as an Application Service Element (ASE)
                 of the OSI Application layer.

              o  Acts as the initiator or as the responder in a
                 connection.

              o  Accesses and transfers files with both binary and
                 character data. It supports FTAM-1, FTAM-2, FTAM-3,
                 and NBS-9 document types.

              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS also supports gateway services
              between FTAM and DAP.

              A full description of the FTAM services in DECnet-Plus for
              OpenVMS is provided in Appendix A of this document.

              DAP

              The DECnet Data Access Protocol (DAP) supports task-to-
              task communications, file and record access, and proxy
              access.

              Task-to-Task Communications: For most applications, you
              can use task-to-task communications in a transparent
              manner where the remote task is treated as a full-duplex,
              record-oriented device. Transparent operation is provided
              with the following interfaces: system service calls,
              RMS calls (OPEN, GET, PUT, and CLOSE), and high-level
              language I/O statements (which are mapped to RMS calls).
              A nontransparent mode of task-to-task communications is
              offered by means of the system service interface that
              extends the capabilities provided by the transparent mode.
              These capabilities include support for interrupt messages
              and multiple inbound connect requests.

        18

 






              Using DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS, an OpenVMS program written
              in a native mode programming language can exchange
              messages with other user programs.

              File Access: File access is supported to and from remote
              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS systems, transparent to native
              mode high-level language programs using RMS. User programs
              can sequentially read, create, and delete files on a
              remote node.

              Record Access: User programs can perform record level
              operations such as GET, PUT, UPDATE, DELETE, FIND, and
              REWIND to access and modify files residing on a remote
              OpenVMS node. In addition to sequential access to a file,
              several other access methods are supported through RMS
              using DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS. These methods include
              random access by relative record number, random access
              by key value, random access by record file address (RFA),
              and block I/O access by virtual block number.

              Proxy Access: Remote users can have access to up to 15
              proxy accounts on a specific remote system. One proxy
              account should be designated as the default proxy account
              on the remote system.

              Command Language File Management

              You can use most OpenVMS Digital Command Language (DCL)
              commands to perform remote file operations. These commands
              include: ANALYZE, APPEND, BACKUP, CLOSE, CONVERT, COPY,
              CREATE, DELETE, DIFFERENCES, DIRECTORY, DUMP, OPEN,
              PRINT, PURGE, READ, SEARCH, SUBMIT, TYPE, and WRITE. The
              operation of these commands is transparent except for
              commands that invoke processing on a specific system (for
              example, SUBMIT/REMOTE and PRINT/REMOTE). Only a node name
              added to a file specification is required to invoke the
              network capabilities using one of these commands.

              Using the COPY command, a user can transfer sequential,
              relative, and indexed-sequential (ISAM) files between
              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS nodes that support compatible
              file structures and record formats. Users can transfer
              sequential or relative files with fixed length, variable
              length, or variable length with fixed control field
              records between two DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS systems.

                                                                      19

 






              Similarly, multikeyed indexed files with variable or fixed
              length records are supported.

              The SUBMIT/REMOTE command allows command files residing on
              a remote node to be submitted for execution at the remote
              node. The command file must be in the format expected
              by the node responsible for execution. DECnet-Plus for
              OpenVMS allows OpenVMS command files to be received from
              other systems and executed.

              The DCL command EXCHANGE/NETWORK allows the transfer of
              files to or from heterogeneous systems. This command gives
              users the option to transfer file types between MS-DOS,
              ULTRIX, and UNIX systems and OpenVMS systems regardless of
              record semantics. Unlike the COPY command, which preserves
              file and record organization during a file transfer,
              this command enables the user to modify file and record
              attributes during file transfer.

              OSI Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)

              The OSI application programming interfaces enable users to
              write distributed applications that communicate over open
              networks and use the OSI services provided by DECnet-Plus.

              The interfaces are provided under the Extended Function
              license and include:

              o  An interface to FTAM (File Transfer, Access, and
                 Management)

              o  Interfaces to the ACSE (Association Control Service
                 Element) and Presentation layers

              o  An interface to ROSE (Remote Operations Service
                 Element)

              o  An interface to the OSI Session layer

        The interfaces permit application writers to use the services of
        the OSI upper layers in their applications.

              The APIs allow you to develop applications on DECnet-Plus
              systems. You must compile and link source code with the
              APIs. The APIs are required on the development system
              and the compile/link system. You can run the resulting
              application on any DECnet-Plus system with the appropriate
              operating system. The APIs are not required on these

        20

 






              target systems. See Appendix C for details on the OSI
              APIs.

              Network Virtual Terminal

              DECnet-Plus supports two upper layer protocols for
              terminal access: the OSI Virtual Terminal protocol and
              the DECnet Command Terminal protocol.

              Virtual Terminal

              Virtual Terminal (VT) supports the ISO Virtual Terminal
              Protocol (ISO 9041). This protocol allows remote logins
              and access to remote applications between DECnet-Plus
              for OpenVMS systems and any remote system, including
              multivendor systems, that also run an ISO-compliant
              Virtual Terminal implementation.

              Virtual Terminal is implemented as an Application Service
              Element (ASE) of the OSI Application layer.

              Virtual Terminal may act as the terminal/initiator (for
              a local user) or as the host/responder (for the remote
              user).

              A full description of Virtual Terminal features is
              provided in Appendix B of this SPD.

              Command Terminal

              The DCL command SET HOST allows a terminal user on one
              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS node to establish a logical
              connection to another DECnet-Plus node that uses the
              Command Terminal (CTERM) protocol. This connection
              makes the terminal appear to be physically connected
              to the remote system and the operator can use all the
              standard system and network utilities supported by that
              remote node. This capability is particularly useful for
              doing remote program development and allows the terminal
              users on smaller application-oriented systems to use the
              resources of larger development-oriented systems.

              Other interfaces are included in DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS.
              You can develop programs and procedures based on these
              interfaces for functions such as file access and task-
              to-task communications on individual systems. Because the
              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS interfaces stay the same, you can

                                                                      21

 






              use the programs and procedures developed on an individual
              system in a network environment without modifying them.



        3 Services

              Downline Loading

              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS allows for the loading of an
              unattended system using the services provided by the
              Maintenance Operations Module (MOM). MOM provides a
              set of maintenance operations over various types of
              circuits by using the Maintenance Operations Protocol
              (MOP). A loadable system is a system that has a load
              device enabled for MOP service functions and for which a
              properly formatted load file is supplied. Downline loading
              involves transferring a copy of the load file image to a
              remote target node. Load requests can come from the local
              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS operator or from the target node.
              Downline loading is supported for Digital server products.
              However, this facility is not supported over asynchronous
              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS VAX connections.

              Downline Task Loading

              Initial task images for loadable systems can be stored
              on OpenVMS file system devices and loaded into remote
              nodes. Programs already executing on loadable systems
              can be checkpointed to the host OpenVMS file system and
              later restored to main memory in the node. These features
              simplify the operation of network systems that do not have
              mass storage devices.

              Downline task loading is not supported over asynchronous
              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS VAX connections.

              Upline Dumping

              Memory images of adjacent nodes connected by DECnet-Plus
              for OpenVMS can be written or dumped into a file on an
              OpenVMS system. This facility provides assistance in
              troubleshooting in the event of a system crash. This
              facility is also supported for Digital server products.

              This facility is not supported over asynchronous
              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS VAX connections.

        22

 






              Mail

              The OpenVMS Mail utility allows transmission of text
              messages between users on systems supporting MAIL-11. The
              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS software allows users to exchange
              mail with users of other DECnet-Plus systems.

              Phone

              The OpenVMS Phone utility allows users to send and receive
              data interactively from one user's terminal to another
              user's terminal. DECnet-Plus allows users on different
              systems in the same DECnet-Plus network to exchange
              information.

              OpenVMS Cluster Alias

              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS supports the ability to access
              nodes in an OpenVMS Cluster using a separate alias node
              address, while retaining the ability to address each node
              in the cluster individually. Not all network objects can
              be accessed using this mechanism. The maximum number of
              nodes supported for a cluster alias is 94. Refer to the
              OpenVMS Cluster SPD (29.78.xx) for relevant restrictions.

              DECnet-Plus no longer requires a cluster member to
              be configured as a router. Clusters in a DECnet-Plus
              environment require a reachable IS-IS compliant router
              on the LAN.

              Network Management

              Network management is provided with the Network Control
              Language (NCL). Network management implements the DECnet-
              Plus layered model, based on the Digital hierarchical
              structure called Enterprise Management Architecture (EMA).

              Users can access NCL through either a command line
              interface or a graphical user interface (GUI) called
              net$mgmt. The GUI allows network managers to view the
              status of network components and control those components
              from a Motif-based window interface.

              The DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS network management software
              allows system and network managers to:

                                                                      23

 






              o  Control and monitor the operation of a network and
                 provide information related to network traffic and
                 performance

              o  Configure network operating parameters

              o  Start up and shut down network components as needed

              o  Detect and isolate network problems, and return the
                 network to service once repaired.

        In addition, the network management software can provide
        information, warning network managers of faulty or failing
        network components, both hardware and software.

              Network Command Language (NCL) is provided as a utility to
              the network manager to perform the operations described
              above.

              Network managers can also use NCL to test specific
              components of the network. NCL enables transmission
              and reception of test messages either between systems
              or through controller loopback arrangements. The messages
              can then be compared for possible errors. NCL helps users
              isolate network problems.

              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS provides network event logging to
              a terminal device, disk file, or remote system. NCL users
              can enable and disable the event logging facility as well
              as optionally filter specific events.

              NCL uses the DNA Common Management Information Protocol
              (CMIP), which permits entity management from a single
              location anywhere in the DECnet-Plus network.

              The Common Trace Facility (CTF) allows the network manager
              to collect and display information about specific protocol
              exchanges between systems.

              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS supports an ISO CMISE application
              programming interface (API) conforming to the service
              definitions in ISO 9595. The API allows for development of
              applications that can communicate with other management
              applications conforming to ISO 9595 on remote nodes in the
              network.

              DECnet-Plus supports the DECnet Phase IV NCP for remote
              management of Phase IV DECnet systems.

        24

 






              Name Service Options

              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS allows the use of one or more
              naming services. The available services are DECdns, DNS
              /BIND, and the Local namespace. Node name and addressing
              information is stored in the native name service; TCP
              /IP information is maintained in DNS/BIND, and DECnet
              and OSI information is maintained in DECdns or the Local
              namespace.

              When you use more than one name service, a configurable
              search list defines the order in which the existing
              services are to be accessed.

              Local Namespace

              The Local namespace replaces the Local Name Option (LNO)
              of the Phase IV product. Using the Local namespace, you
              can define up to 100,000 nodes in a local naming database.
              A migration tool is available to move Phase IV and/or LNO
              databases to the new large local file format and/or DECdns
              format.

              DNS/BIND

              DECnet can now use TCP/IP naming and addressing informa-
              tion from the DNS/BIND name service.

              DECdns

              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS provides a global naming service
              called the Digital Distributed Naming Service (DECdns).

              The full DECdns service provides a consistent, network-
              wide set of names for network resources called the
              namespace. This namespace is maintained by one or more
              DECdns server systems. Digital recommends that DECdns
              servers be installed on at least two systems in every LAN.
              This should provide adequate service and redundancy.

              The features provided by DECdns include:

              o  A networkwide name-to-attribute mapping service that
                 allows selected Digital applications to create, read,
                 modify, and delete names in the namespace

              o  A hierarchical structure permitting a large number of
                 names to be stored and distributed across the network

                                                                      25

 






              o  Access control to each name in the namespace

              o  Management and event logging

        Distributed Time Service

              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS provides a network time service
              with DECdts, the Digital Distributed Time Service. DECdts
              provides precise, fault-tolerant clock synchronization for
              systems in a LAN or WAN. Time is provided in Coordinated
              Universal Time (UTC) and can be used across a global
              network. Several forms of time providers are supported,
              and a callable interface for applications allows users
              to add their own time providers. DECdts can be used by
              distributed applications to determine event sequencing,
              duration, and scheduling.

        3.1 Operation


              DECnet-Plus is implemented under OpenVMS as an ancillary
              control process (ACP) and a network device driver with
              Digital-supplied executive-level components and user-level
              programs.

              The normal OpenVMS protection has been incorporated in the
              operation of DECnet-Plus. For example, incoming connects,
              including file access and file transfer requests, are
              protected by the normal OpenVMS login and file protection
              mechanisms. Outgoing connects, including file access
              and file transfer requests, can include user password
              information that is implicitly specified by NCL, or
              explicitly specified by the user for verification on the
              remote node.

        3.2 Configuration and Performance

              You can configure DECnet-Plus using either the BASIC or
              ADVANCED configuration options.

              With DECnet Version 6.3 and later, cluster nodes are
              configurable from any node within the cluster.



        26

 






              As with any network protocol, the performance of a given
              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS node is a function not only of
              the expected network traffic and resultant processing, but
              also of the amount of concurrent processing specific to
              that node. Thus, node performance depends on many factors
              including:

              o  CPU type

              o  Number and type of devices attached to the particular
                 CPU

              o  Number of device interrupts per unit time

              o  Communications line(s) characteristics

              o  Number and size of buffers

              o  Message size and frequency of transmission

              o  Applications in use

              It is important to note that the rate at which user data
              can be transmitted (throughput) over a communications
              line can sometimes approach, but will never exceed, the
              actual line speed. This is because the actual throughput
              is a function of many factors, including the line quality,
              protocol overhead, topology, and network application(s),
              as well as the factors cited in this section.

              The performance of DECnet-Plus is comparable to the
              performance of DECnet Phase IV.

        3.3 Standards Conformance

        4 Installation

              DECnet-Plus software is customer installable. Installation
              services are available for customers who request
              installation of the software product by an experienced
              Digital software specialist.

              Digital requires that a customer's first use of X.25
              include Digital Installation Services. These services
              provide for installation of the software product by an
              experienced Digital software specialist.

              Customer Responsibilities




        28

 






              Before Digital Services can install the software, the
              customer must:

              o  Ensure that the system meets the minimum hardware and
                 software requirements (as specified in the relevant
                 SPDs)

              o  Prior to installing Digital hardware or software,
                 obtain, install, and demonstrate as operational any
                 modems and other necessary customer equipment or
                 facilities to which Digital's communications hardware
                 or software will connect

              o  Designate one adjacent node to verify installation and
                 connectivity

              o  Make available for a reasonable period of time, as
                 mutually agreed upon by Digital and the customer, all
                 hardware communications facilities and terminals that
                 are to be used during installation.

              Delays caused by any failure to meet these responsibili-
              ties will be charged at the prevailing rate for time and
              materials.

              Installation of DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS consists of the
              following tasks:

              o  Verify that all components of DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS
                 have been received.

              o  Verify that the necessary versions of the OpenVMS
                 software and documentation are available.

              o  Verify the appropriate SYSGEN parameters.
                 Note: If a software specialist is required to modify
                 the previously installed operating system parameters, a
                 time and materials charge will apply.

              o  Create any necessary DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS accounts
                 and directories.

              o  Enable software by registering the License Product
                 Authorization Key (PAK) .

              o  Install the DECnet-Plus software on the target system
                 using the POLYCENTER Software Installation utility .

                                                                      29

 






              o  Verify the proper installation of DECnet-Plus
                 for OpenVMS by running a series of tests to show
                 connectivity to a designated node.

              Connectivity to all other nodes within the network is the
              responsibility of the customer. Digital recommends the use
              of NCL to help verify connectivity.

              In some cases, the PSDN supplier (or PTT) may impose
              restrictions, limitations, or requirements on the
              proposed Digital network configuration. The customer must
              understand and adhere to these controls for every network.

              For installation of the X.25 software, the customer must:

              o  Demonstrate equivalence of operation for modems other
                 than Bell 208A, 208B, 209, 212A synchronous modems, or
                 in Europe, PTT approved modems.

              o  Subscribe to the open user group and to at least
                 two switched virtual circuits (SVCs) to complete
                 the product's installation checkout (this test loops
                 information from the X.25 native system to the PSDN and
                 back to X.25 native system). Systems that use permanent
                 virtual circuits (PVCs) or closed user groups only, or
                 where the PSDN does not support calls to the same DTE
                 address, require specially negotiated arrangements for
                 Digital installation of the product.

        5 Hardware Requirements

              Refer to the OpenVMS Operating System for Alpha and VAX
              Software Product Description (SPD 25.01.xx) for hardware
              requirements and processor support.

              For general device or controller descriptions, refer to
              the Networks and Communications Buyer's Guide.

              Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1)

              The following counts refer to the disk space required
              on the system disk. The sizes are approximate; actual
              sizes may vary depending on the user's system environment,
              configuration, and software options.

              For OpenVMS VAX Systems

        30

 






              Disk space required for installation of base software:
              77,000 blocks

              Disk space required for installation of all optional
              software: 101,000 blocks

              For WAN Device Drivers

              Disk space required for installation: 5,000 blocks (2.5
              MB)

              The disk space required for permanent use depends on
              the number and type of drivers installed, but should not
              exceed the space required for installation.

              For X.25 Software

              Disk space required for installation: 8,000 blocks (4 MB)

              Disk space required for use (permanent): 10,000 blocks (5
              MB)

              These counts refer to the disk space required on the
              system disk. The sizes are approximate; actual sizes
              may vary depending on the user's system environment,
              configuration, and software options.

              Supported LAN Adapters

              The LAN adapters listed in Table 2 are supported:

        Cluster Environment

              The WAN device drivers are fully supported when installed
              on any valid and licensed OpenVMS Cluster configuration. A
              device driver can only be accessed from the system or node
              containing the communications device.

              On common disks, to configure some product-specific
              attributes that must remain unique to each system, certain
              components of the product are stored in the system-
              specific environment (SYS$SPECIFIC: [SYSxxx]) of the VAX
              computer on which the installation is being performed.
              The remaining components of the product, including some or
              all of the executable images, are installed common to all
              accessing VAX systems.

              Though some or all of the product's executable images
              exist in the common system directory (SYS$COMMON:
              [SYS$LDR]) and are executable by all VAX computers
              sharing this directory, it is essential that the product
              be installed separately on all OpenVMS Cluster systems
              requiring access to configure the product uniquely for
              each.

              The same version of WAN device drivers must be used on all
              systems in OpenVMS Cluster systems accessing a common disk
              and in local area OpenVMS Cluster configurations.

              Communications Devices

              One of the communications devices listed in Table 3 is
              required for use with X.25 native and WANDD.

                                                                      33

 






                 transmission, reception, and framing in microcode. You
                 can use the two lines independently to run different
                 protocols or to provide a failover capability between
                 lines in the event of an application or system failure.

              o  The DMB32 (BI-bus) and the DMF32 (UNIBUS) are
                 multifunction devices that include a single DMA line.
                 The communications controllers perform character
                 transmission, reception, and framing in microcode.

              o  The DSB32 (BI-bus) is a dual-line synchronous
                 communications device for VAXBI systems. The DSB32

                 VAX 10000 systems.

              o  The DSB32 is not supported for use on a VAX 6600
                 with extended addressing (>512 MB of physical memory)
                 enabled.

              o  The DMB32, DMF32, and DSH32 are multifunction devices.
                 Only the device driver for the synchronous ports are
                 included in the DECnet-Plus kit.

              o  The DMB32 must be revision J or later for applications
                 using GENBYTE, HDLC, or SDLC protocols.

              o  The DMF32 must be revision J of later for applications
                 using HDLC protocol and revision M is required for
                 simultaneous operation of the printer port.

              o  The DMB32 only supports a synchronous line speed of
                 19.2 Kb/s if any asynchronous lines are in use. The
                 DMB32 is also supported on VAX 7000 and VAX 10000
                 systems configured with extended addressing, (32-bit
                 physical addresses).

        34

 






              o  The DMF32 is supported on a VAXBI system fitted with a
                 DWBUA UNIBUS adapter for DDCMP and GENBYTE protocol use
                 only.

              o  The DSH32 running the DDCMP protocol only supports a
                 single line at 9.6 Kb/s on a MicroVAX 2000. Running the
                 BISYNC protocol, it only supports a single line at 4.8
                 Kb/s on a MicroVAX 2000.

              o  The DSV11, DSW42, and the DSB32 support the use of
                 different protocols on each of the two lines of the
                 device.

              o  The DUP11 is supported on a VAXBI system fitted with a
                 DWBUA UNIBUS adapter for VAX 8200, VAX 8250, VAX 8300,
                 VAX 8300, VAX 8350, VAX 8500, VAX 8530, VAX 8550, VAX
                 8700, and VAX 8800 systems only.

        All the WAN device drivers included with DECnet-Plus offer
        support for a user ($QIO) interface. Table 4 lists the device
        driver characteristics and indicates the maximum permitted
        line speeds for each of the line protocols supported by the
        individual drivers.

                Where two line speeds are shown, for example 256/64,
                the higher speed refers to single line operation of
                the device while the lower speed refers to dual line
                operation of the device.

                _____________________________________________________

              The WAN device drivers included with DECnet-Plus also
              provide a pseudodriver (WANDRIVER) that provides a
              programming interface to the data link level for the LAPB,
              DEC-HDLC, and DDCMP protocols.

              The device drivers all support full-duplex and half-
              duplex operation, where appropriate to the protocol. DDCMP
              and SDLC device drivers support both point-to-point and
              multipoint tributary operation. "BISYNC" refers to the
              IBM implementation of bisynchronous protocol. The GENBYTE
              protocol is a general byte-oriented protocol for use with
              user-written framing routines, is supported by the DMB32
              and the DMF32 device drivers.

              The maximum permitted line speed depends on the line
              interface standard used and must not exceed 19.2 Kb/s
              for an RS232 V.24 interface. There may be additional line
              speed restrictions for other line interface standards.
              Refer to the Software Product Descriptions for the
              synchronous interfaces for more information.

        36

 






              Other Digital communications layered products may not
              necessarily support operation of the synchronous interface
              at the maximum line speed supported by the device driver.
              Refer to the appropriate Software Product Description for
              the Digital communications layered product for precise
              details of supported configurations.

              In all cases, throughput over synchronous lines is
              dependent on the user application and system environment.

              The WAN device drivers all support modem control signal
              operation. Refer to the Software Product Descriptions for
              the appropriate synchronous interface for details of the
              modem signals supported by an individual interface.

              Optional Hardware

              Additional communications device(s) subject to the
              limitations described in Table 4 of this SPD are required.

              Supported Public Networks

              Table 5 describes public PSDNs that are supported with the
              X.25 software only in the countries shown. In addition to
              these public PSDNs, certain private PSDNs have been tested
              by Digital and appropriate profiles are included in the
              X.25 software.

              Since the publication of this SPD, other configurations
              may have been tested. Consult your local Digital office
              for any questions concerning other public PSDNs. Digital
              has designed or adopted the X.25 software to operate
              with equipment conforming to ISO 8208/7776, with certain
              private PSDNs that have been approved by Digital, and with
              public networks in Table 5. Profiles for these private and
              public PSDNs are included in X.25. Connections to public
              networks not shown in this table are not supported by
              Digital.

              The presence of a network/country combination in
              Table 5 shows Digital's commitment to support the X.25
              software when using that public X.25 service. It does
              not necessarily imply that network certification by
              the particular networking authority has been granted
              for all or any hardware devices supported by the X.25

                                                                      37

 






              software. Contact your local Digital office for up-to-
              date information regarding supported configurations and

              X.25 Software Configuration Guidelines

              Table 6 describes the physical hardware configurations
              supported by X.25 in terms of CPU type and communication
              interface. It is assumed that there are 128 bytes of
              user data per packet in an X.25 native mode configuration
              where data is being sent and received at maximum speeds
              in both directions. This table indicates the maximum

        40

 






              load for certain VAX processors supported at the time
              of publication.

              The numbers given in the table are load costs. Load costs
              indicate the overhead of full-duplex packet transfer
              at the indicated speed. The load units are calculated
              for an application that does no work with transmitted
              /received data, and indicate a maximum packet rate for
              that configuration. An idle device incurs negligible load.
              Systems should be configured to sustain peak load rates.

        Factors to Consider

              Other factors to consider when configuring hardware
              devices for use with X.25 on a given processor are:

              o  Hardware configuration limits, such as power supply,
                 backplane space, bus throughput and mapping registers
                 available, and any other restrictions on the number of
                 devices per CPU or per bus must be observed.

              o  Actual/average packet size in bytes - Generally,
                 doubling the actual packet size will halve the load
                 units consumed for direct memory access (DMA) devices,
                 but increase the load units for character-interrupt
                 devices by approximately 30 percent.

              o  Table 6 assumes that data is sent and received in each
                 direction of a full-duplex line in equal ratio. If the
                 number of X.25 packets per second is predominantly
                 one-way, the load units per line can be reduced
                 proportionately up to a factor of 50 percent.

                                                                      43

 






              The maximum system configuration with a mix of device
              types is computed by adding the load costs (in load units)
              for each device up to the limit for a given processor
              type. Table 7 lists the load units for devices at various
              speeds.

              __________________________________________________________

              Example 1:

        44

 






              A VAX 8500 computer is being used to process X.25 native
              mode communications. If the system uses one line of a
              DSB32 at 192 Kb/s and a DMB32 at 19.2 Kb/s, the load
              unit total is 156. Assuming these devices are fully
              active, they will consume 156/360 = 43% of the CPU for
              communications processing. It is inadvisable to add more
              devices to this CPU, unless it is dedicated to the task of
              communications processing.

              Example 2:

              When one line of a DSV11 is fully used on a MicroVAX 3800
              at 64 Kb/s, it consumes 120/390 = 31% of the processor in
              processing X.25 communications.

              Certain versions of these products depend on a specific
              version of the operating system. Refer to the Software

        13 Software Warranty

              Warranty for this software is provided by Digital with the
              purchase of a license for the product as defined in the
              Software Warranty Addendum of this SPD.

        14 Appendix A: File Transfer, Access, and Management (FTAM)

              FTAM software provides communications for the following
              file operations between open systems:

              o  Copying files between local and remote systems

              o  Appending, deleting, or renaming files

              o  Displaying information about files

              An open system is a computer system that implements the
              standards for each of the seven layers of the Open Systems
              Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model for communications
              as defined by the International Organization for
              Standardization. An FTAM system is any open system
              containing an FTAM implementation that conforms to the
              FTAM standard and includes the implementations of the
              necessary underlying OSI services.

              FTAM implements several standards that define the
              following components of these layers of the OSI Basic
              Reference Model: the FTAM service element and the
              Association Control Service Element (ACSE) of the
              Application layer, the Presentation layer, and the Session
              layer.

              Supported Standards

              FTAM conforms to the following OSI standards:

              o  ISO 8571 - File Transfer, Access, and Management
                 service and protocol

              o  ISO 8650 - ACSE protocol

              o  ISO 8823 - Presentation protocol

              o  ISO 8327 - Session protocol

                                                                      49

              FTAM Component Software

              The component software includes the user facilities
              (initiators), responders, management tools, and problem
              determination tools.

              FTAM User Facilities

              Users access the FTAM user facilities by entering the
              following OpenVMS operating system commands: APPEND, COPY,
              DIRECTORY, RENAME, and DELETE. These commands operate on
              files stored on any FTAM system whose implementations are
              compatible with FTAM. You cannot use these commands to
              manipulate files directly on your local system.

              Support for Any File-Naming Convention

              A file designation is system-specific information
              that identifies a file to its storage system. FTAM
              software lets users specify files using the naming
              conventions of the systems where the files reside. FTAM
              supports the OpenVMS operating system RMS format for
              file specifications and a comparable style of file-
              specification format that accommodates non-RMS file
              designations.

              Support for Several File Types

              FTAM software can access and transfer files containing
              both binary and ASCII data. FTAM-1, FTAM-2, FTAM-3, and
              NBS-9 document types are supported.

                                                                      51

 






              FTAM-1 files are unstructured text files, FTAM-2 files are
              sequential text files, and FTAM-3 files are unstructured
              binary files. Table 9 shows the parameters supported by
              FTAM-1, FTAM-2, and FTAM-3 document types.

              ________Fixed_______________Presence_of_parameter_________

              NBS-9 files are NBS file directories.

              Flexible and Transparent Access for Local Files

              FTAM software treats local files the same way that the
              OpenVMS operating system file system treats them.

              File Transfers

              The FTAM COPY command transfers files between compatible
              FTAM systems without modifying the source file. The
              facility can transfer files in either direction between
              the local system and a remote FTAM system. The COPY
              command can also transfer files between two remote FTAM
              systems for a local FTAM user.

              The COPY command also allows you to append one or more
              files to a single output file within or between FTAM
              systems.

        52

 






              FTAM-DAP Gateway

              The FTAM-DAP Gateway lets you perform file operations
              from a non-OSI system that supports the DAP protocol to an
              OSI system supporting FTAM. Remote users of the gateway
              need not establish accounts on the gateway system to use
              its capabilities. The gateway does not support the APPEND
              functionality.

              File Deletion

              The FTAM DELETE command lets you delete one or more files
              on any combination of FTAM systems provided you have
              delete access to those files on the specific FTAM system.

              Renaming Requests

              The FTAM RENAME command allows you to rename files. The
              command works on files stored on remote FTAM systems
              (remote files). The command enables you to change the
              path name or file name of an existing file. For remote
              files, you must specify whatever type of information the
              remote FTAM system requires for specifying files.

              Directory Requests

              The FTAM DIRECTORY command lets you display the complete
              set of FTAM file attributes. Specific options allow you to
              vary the display of attributes that are meaningful in an
              OpenVMS operating system environment, for example, date
              and time of the last modification of file name.

              FTAM File Error Recovery

              FTAM provides file error recovery functionality, both in
              the COPY initiator command and in the FTAM responder. File
              error recovery is provided for classes 1, 2, and 3 errors
              as detailed in ISO 8571-4.

              Class 1 file error recovery provides only the restart
              functionality, while classes 2 and 3 provide both the
              restart and recovery functionality as follows:

              o  If an internal error is detected in the data transfer
                 regime, class 1 recovery restarts the data transfer
                 regime by retransmitting the file data beginning at the
                 negotiated checkpoint within the data transfer regime.

                                                                      53

 






              o  Class 2 error recovery provides for the re-establishment
                 of the select and open regimes, and also allows for the
                 retransmission of file data beginning at a negotiated
                 checkpoint within the data transfer regime.

              o  Class 3 error recovery provides full recovery by re-
                 establishing a lost FTAM association and its select
                 and open regimes. Class 3 recovery then restarts the
                 data transfer regime by retransmitting the file data
                 beginning at the negotiated checkpoint within the data
                 transfer regime.

              All restart and recovery operations and procedures are
              completely transparent to the user.

              Management and Problem Determination Tools

              FTAM software supplies a number of management tools,
              including an installation verification procedure (IVP),
              a tracing utility, event logging, and informational and
              error messages.

              FTAM Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)

              The FTAM IVP sets up outbound and inbound application
              associations. A connection is made to your local system
              (as a loopback test). The FTAM IVP checks that your
              installation is able to set up and release presentation
              and session connections. It tests the FTAM software by
              starting a responder and reading the attributes of a file
              with the DIRECTORY command.

              FTAM Tracing Utility

              The FTAM tracing utility (OSITRACE) is a tool for
              identifying problems in protocol exchanges between your
              local system and any remote FTAM system. The tracing
              utility captures protocol exchanges and transcribes
              them into easily read text; OSITRACE data is written to
              SYS$OUTPUT.

              The FTAM tracing utility monitors data exchanges for
              individual associations. The tracing utility can trace
              data originating from the following components: FTAM
              (DATA, PROTOCOL, and STRUCTURING), ACSE, Presentation,
              and Session.

        54

 






              OSI Address Lookup Using X.500

              The FTAM software is capable of retrieving network
              addresses from the X.500 directory. You can use this
              functionality with or instead of retrieving addresses
              from a local repository.

              FTAM Event Logging

              For event logging, the FTAM responder writes records to
              OSIF$RESPONDER.LOG.

              Requirements for Compatibility with FTAM

              FTAM lets an open system perform a specific set of file
              transfer, access, and management activities with any open
              system having a compatible FTAM implementation.

              The Protocol Implementation Conformance Statement
              (PICS) provides more information about Digital's FTAM
              implementation.

        15 Appendix B: Virtual Terminal

              DECnet-Plus Virtual Terminal (VT) is Digital Equipment
              Corporation's implementation of the ISO Virtual Terminal
              Basic Class standard, which consists of the service
              definition (ISO 9040) and the protocol (ISO 9041). VT
              software adheres to these standards, thereby providing
              interactive access between DECnet-Plus systems and other
              multivendor terminal systems and host systems that also
              adhere to the ISO Virtual Terminal Basic Class standard.

              VT is implemented as an Application Service Element (ASE)
              of the OSI Application layer.

              VT can run over Transport layer classes 0, 2 or 4 over
              CONS, and TP4 over CLNS. VT can also run over TCP/IP
              networks using RFC 1006.

              VT provides terminal/initiator (for a local user) and host
              /responder (for the remote user) capabilities. Terminal
              /responder and host/initiator are not supported.


                                                                      55

 






              Supported Standards

              OSI Address Lookup using X.500

              The VT software is capable of retrieving network addresses
              from the X.500 directory. You can use this functionality
              with or instead of retrieving addresses from a local
              repository.

              Command Mode

              Command mode allows you to execute commands that can
              modify the characteristics of the Virtual Terminal
              association with the remote application.

              Trace Utility

              The VT tracing utility (OSITRACE) is a tool for iden-
              tifying problems in protocol exchanges between your
              local system and any remote system. The utility captures
              protocol exchanges and transcribes them into easily read
              text.

              The tracing utility monitors data exchanges for individual
              associations. The utility can trace data originating from
              the VT, ACSE, Presentation, and Session components.

        16 Appendix C: OSI Application Programming Interfaces

              FTAM API

              The FTAM API supports the OSI standard ISO 8571:
              Information Processing Systems, Open Systems Interconnection,
              and File Transfer, Access, and Management.

              The FTAM API provides the interface to the FTAM protocol
              machine provided in DECnet-Plus. Communications between
              the application code and the FTAM protocol machine are
              carried out using ASN.1 encoded data structures. The API
              supports the following functions:

                 Abort
                 Begin-Group
                 Cancel
                 Change-Attributes
                 Create
                 Close
                 Data
                 Data-End
                 Delete
                 Deselect

              OSI Application Kernel (OSAK) API

              The OSAK API provides a direct interface to servcies at
              the ACSE and Presentation layer. The OSAK API supports the
              following OSI standards for the ACSE layer:

              o  ISO 8650: Information Processing Systems, Open Systems
                 Interconnection, Protocol Specification for the
                 Association Control Service Element

              o  ISO 8649: Information Processing Systems, Open Systems
                 Interconnection, Service Definition for the Association
                 Control Service Element

              The OSAK API provides the interface to the ACSE services.
              It provides the following services:

                 Associate
                 Release
                 Abort
                 Redirect

              The redirect service is not an ACSE service. The service
              allows applications to redirect an incoming association to
              another process on the local system.

              The OSAK API also includes support for the OSI Presentation
              layer with support for the following OSI standards:

              o  ISO 8823: Information Processing Systems, Open Systems
                 Interconnection, Connection-Oriented Presentation
                 Protocol Specification

              o  ISO 8822: Information Processing Systems, Open Systems
                 Interconnection, Connection-Oriented Presentation
                 Service Definition

              o  ISO 8327: Information Processing Systems, Open Systems
                 Interconnection, Basic Connection-Oriented Session
                 Protocol Specification

        58

 






              o  ISO 8326: Information Processing Systems, Open Systems
                 Interconnection, Basic Connection-Oriented Session
                 Service Definition

              The Presentation layer services supported by the OSAK API
              are:

                 Alter-Context
                 Data
                 Capability-Data
                 Expedited-Data
                 Typed-Data
                 Token-Please
                 Token-Give
                 Control-Give
                 Sync-Major
                 Sync-Minor
                 Resynchronize
                 Exception-Report
                 Activity-Start
                 Activity-Interrupt
                 Activity-Resume
                 Activity-Discard
                 Activity-End

              The OSAK API also supports (by pass through) the OSI
              Session layer services.

              Session Layer API

              The Session layer API, called the OSAK Session Programming
              Interface (SPI), supports the following OSI standards:

              o  ISO 8327: Information Processing Systems, Open Systems
                 Interconnection, Basic Connection Oriented Session
                 Protocol Specification

              o  ISO 8326: Information Processing Systems, Open Systems
                 Interconnection, Basic Connection Oriented Session
                 Service Definition.

              Support for the OSAK SPI interface is limited to Version
              3.0. The OSAK Version 1.1 SPI interface is no longer
              supported.

                                                                      59

 






              The Session layer supports ISO Session version 1 and
              version 2. Session version 1 allows up to 512 octets
              of user data on a service. Session version 2 supports
              the restrictions imposed by the National Institute of
              Standards and Technology allowing up to 10,240 octets of
              data on a service.

              DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS Version 7.1 includes Version 3.0
              of the OSAK SPI. Users of the OSAK SPI Version 1.1 should
              upgrade to Version 3.0.

              The OSAK API provides the interface to the following
              connect and release services:

                 Connect
                 Release
                 Abort
                 Redirect

              The redirect service is not a Session service. The service
              allows applications to redirect an incoming connection to
              another process on the local system.

              The Session layer services supported by the OSAK API are:

                 Data
                 Capability-Data
                 Expedited-Data
                 Typed-Data
                 Token-Please
                 Token-Give
                 Control-Give
                 Sync-Major
                 Sync-Minor
                 Resynchronize
                 Exception-Report
                 Activity-Start
                 Activity-Interrupt
                 Activity-Resume
                 Activity-Discard
                 Activity-End

              ROSE API

              The Remote Operations Service Element (ROSE) supports the
              OSI standard ISO 9072: Information Processing Systems,
              Text Communication, and Remote Operations.

              ROSE supports interactive applications in a distributed
              open systems environment. It is a service for multivendor
              distributed processing.

              The ROSE functionality provides a mechanism that allows
              for encoding and decoding the remote operations protocol
              control information, as defined in ISO 9072, for the
              following services:

                 Invoke
                 Result
                 Error
                 Reject
