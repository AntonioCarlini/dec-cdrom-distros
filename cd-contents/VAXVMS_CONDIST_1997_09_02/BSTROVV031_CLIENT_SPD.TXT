 PRODUCT NAME:   BASEstar Open Client                   SPD 62.54.03
                  Version 3.1

 DESCRIPTION

 BASEstar Open is an industrial automation integration framework that
 facilitates the integration of manufacturing applications and plant
 equipment. Accelerated development of integrated manufacturing sys-
 tems is assured through an architecture that also encourages consis-
 tency of application development.

 BASEstar Open takes advantage of the client/server computing archi-
 tecture. BASEstar Open Servers provide the robust, high-availability
 environment required by mission-critical applications. BASEstar Open
 Clients, on the other hand, provide access to all BASEstar Open ser-
 vices and BASEstar Open-managed information from any network Node on
 which BASEstar Open Client is installed. Client and server communi-
 cations within BASEstar Open are provided through TCP/IP network com-
 munications.

 For a description of the BASEstar Open Server product, refer to SPD
 47.87.xx.

 The BASEstar Open Client allows applications to have transparent ac-
 cess to BASEstar Open objects regardless of their physical location
 in the distributed BASEstar Open environment. BASEstar Open Client pro-
 vides an Application Programming Interface that allows applications
 to:

 o  Define, reference, and access Data_Point objects

 o  Define, reference, notify, subscribe, and receive event objects

 o  Define, reference, and exchange Packet data objects.

 Features

 The following features are those that a BASEstar Open Client can re-
 quest from a BASEstar Open Server via BASEstar Open's API:

 Application Integration

 o  Data Management

 BASEstar Open Data Services provide a standard mechanism for defin-
 ing, organizing, and accessing data in a distributed manufacturing en-
 vironment from a variety of sources including plant devices and area,
 plant, and work cell applications.

 BASEstar Open defines discrete elements (Data_Points) to contain man-
 ufacturing information. Data_Point definitions can be of various types,
 ranging from scalar data elements to user-defined data structures. This
 provides the high flexibility of data definition and acquisition re-
 quired to define the many different types of data typically present
 in industrial plants.

 Since each Data_Point is referenced by name, applications become in-
 dependent of their data sources and consequently do not require al-
 teration as data sources change. In addition, simple Data_Points can
 have a predefined value specified at startup time. The value of a Data_
 Point may also be derived from the value of another Data_Point. The
 derived value can be obtained directly or modified by an arithmetic/logical
 expression. Data Services allow applications to define and manage Data_
 Points.

 You can associate each Data_Point with one or more Triggers. A Trig-
 ger defines a relationship between a Data_Point, a Filter, and an Event.
 Each time the value of a triggered Data_Point changes, associated Fil-
 ter expressions are evaluated. Whenever the Boolean result of an eval-
 uated Filter expression is TRUE, BASEstar Open declares the associ-
 ated Event.


                                  2

 

 Likewise, the Timer object allows you to apply a time-based condition
 to the execution of an action. You can define the time condition as
 an absolute date, a time interval, or a combination of the two. When
 the Timer expires, BASEstar Open sends a message to the associated ob-
 jects. You can associate Timers with Trigger objects.

 It is possible to store one or more versions of a Data_Point value.
 In addition to the value, each Data_Point version includes the time
 when the Data_Point value changed and its status at that time.

 BASEstar Open generates a new version each time the value of a Data_
 Point changes. You can therefore request the current version, contain-
 ing the current value, or alternatively, the value associated with any
 cached version.

 o  Event Services

 BASEstar Open Event Services allow you to subscribe to one or more Events.
 Events are occurrences that are of interest to an application program-
 like threshold exceeding, alarms, job completion, and so on. You can
 define the occurrence of such Events and specify the context infor-
 mation that you wish to pass. This context information can also in-
 clude data and their types.

 On declaration of an Event, Event Services create and deliver the no-
 tifications that the subscribers receive.

 o  Packet Services

 BASEstar Open Packet Services allow you to exchange Packets of infor-
 mation directly with other users. Two users can establish direct com-
 munication through a Port; one user connects to send a Packet, and the
 other user connects to receive it.

 A Packet contains a description of information to be exchanged. Each
 Packet input and output parameter is described by a datatype.

 BASEstar Open delivers a Packet to a Port in a protocol-independent
 manner and also independent of the location of the users and Ports in-
 volved.

 o  Graphic Configuration Utility (GCU)

                                  3

 

 BASEstar Open offers a PC-based Graphic Configuration utility with an
 MS Windows "look and feel". It allows users to:

    o  Manage BASEstar Open objects using create, delete and modify com-
       mands

    o  Load existing configurations from CLI scripts and snapshots

    o  Save configurations in CLI scripts and snapshots

    o  Browse through BASEstar Open configurations.

 The Graphic Configuration utility is bundled with BASEstar Open Server
 kits on Windows NT systems. It is included with the BASEstar Open Client
 on Windows 95 and Windows NT systems.

 BASEstar Open users on UNIX or OpenVMS platforms can take advantage
 of the Graphic Configuration utility via the PC-based BASEstar Open
 Client and GCU product. The PC-based Graphic Configuration utility re-
 places the Motif-based GCU previously available with BASEstar Open Ver-
 sion 2.0.

 o  DDE Connectivity DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) is a protocol that al-
    lows PC-based applications to exchange data. It ensures compati-
    bility between the PC-based data representation (used on Windows
    NT, Windows 95 and MS Windows platforms) and the native BASEstar
    Open data representation. This capability augments significantly
    the scope of BASEstar Open, allowing you to integrate DDE-compliant
    software packages such as Microsoft Excel, InTouch from Wonderware,
    and DDE drivers.
