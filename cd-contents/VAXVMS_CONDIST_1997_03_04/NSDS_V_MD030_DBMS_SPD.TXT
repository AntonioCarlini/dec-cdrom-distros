PRODUCT NAME:  DEC DB Integrator Gateway for DBMS,     SPD 51.13.01
               Version 1.0B for OpenVMS

DESCRIPTION

DEC DB Integrator Gateway for DBMS for OpenVMS VAX and AXP (DBMS Gate-
way) provides applications and tools with direct, read and update[1]
access to DEC DBMS databases. This access can be via interactive or
dynamic SQL interfaces. Support for client/server access is provided
by the SQL/Services facility and the DEC ODBC Driver for MS Windows[TM]
clients. Optional support for embedded SQL and SQL module language pro-
gramming is available.

The DBMS Gateway also provides native integration with DEC DB Inte-
grator (DBI). DBI extends the functionality of the DBMS Gateway and
provides DBI Catalog storage of the DBMS metadata and provides the abil-
ity to do cross-database joins.

The DBMS Gateway runs under the OpenVMS VAX Operating System on Dig-
ital VAX, MicroVAX, VAXstation, VAXserver and VAXft systems, servers
and workstations.

Features

Performance

The DBMS Gateway selects access strategies that minimize data trans-
fer activity. Wherever possible, selection, filtering, and statisti-
cal operations are done by the DBMS. A log of communications activ-
ity and errors is maintained to assist in problem isolation and eval-
uation.

____________________
  The  update access provided by this product allows existing records
  in the DBMS database to be modified.  It does not allow new records

  to be inserted or existing records to be deleted

SQL Programming Interfaces

The DBMS Gateway provides direct, read and update[1] access to DBMS
databases. User applications access data from these databases in the
same way as they would access data from a DEC Rdb database. SQL sup-
port includes Interactive SQL and Dynamic SQL for server-based devel-
opment and the SQL/Services facility to support client/server imple-
mentations.

o  Interactive SQL supports DEC SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML).

o  The dynamic SQL interface compiles and executes SQL requests passed
   through its call interface. This programming approach is highly ef-
   fective in applications such as ad-hoc query where the exact pa-
   rameters of requests are not known until runtime. It is compati-
   ble with any programming language that supports the OpenVMS call-
   ing standard. The dynamic memory handling capabilities of DEC Ada
   VAX PL/I and VAX C enable these languages to take full advantage
   of the power and flexibility of this approach.

o  All data format translations for supported OpenVMS datatypes are
   performed automatically as part of handling requests to read and
   update data in DBMS databases.

Distributed Data Access

The DBMS Gateway supports access from remote clients and to remote DBMS
databases.

Integration with DEC SQL Applications

The DBMS Gateway makes data residing in DBMS databases accessible to
Digital Information Management an End-User Access tools.

o  DEC Data Distributor can maintain extracts and rollups of DBMS ta-
   bles and views.

o  DATATRIEVE queries and reports can combine data from DBMS Gateways,
   other DBI Gateways and DEC Rdb databases.

o  DEC RALLY applications can query and report DBMS databases.

                                 2

 

Optional SQL Compiler Support

Support for SQL 3GL application development is available with the op-
tional purchase of a DEC SQL development licenses. DEC SQL develop-
ment licenses provide precompiler support for embedded SQL applica-
tions, a compiler for SQL module language programs and an application
programming interface (API) to support the development of client/server
applications.

Embedded SQL programming places SQL language statements in line with
host language statements. Precompilers replace these SQL statements
with call statements and object modules. The modified host language
program is compiled and linked with the object modules to form an ex-
ecutable image. Precompilers for DEC C, DEC Ada, DEC COBOL, DEC For-
tran, DEC Pascal and PL/I for OpenVMS are included.

Table 1 describes the DEC SQL precomplier support by platform.

These precompilers support an optional Federal Information Process-
ing Standards (FIPS) flagger that allows the user to identify any SQL
statements which are not in the current ANSI/ISO SQL standard. An ex-
ception flagger for the Multivendor Integration Architecture (MIA) stan-
dard is also provided.

                                 3

 

The SQL module language processor allows SQL statements and multistate-
ment procedures to be grouped into modules. When these modules are com-
piled, the resulting object modules can be linked with objects cre-
ated by any language compiler that complies with the OpenVMS calling
standard. The SQL module language compiler also supports FIPS and MIA
flagging.

SQL/Services API programming libraries are used to interface client
applications to the SQL/Services server. MS-DOS[R] or MS Windows client
applications can be written in Microsoft C. Macintosh[R] client ap-
plications can be written in MPW[TM] C or ThinkC.

A DEC SQL development license also includes SQL/Services client pro-
gramming libraries for Microsoft Windows[TM], Windows NT[TM], Digi-
tal UNIX, MS-DOS, Sun[R], ULTRIX or OpenVMS platforms.

The following table summarizes SQL/Services network support. Clients
other than the DEC ODBC Driver for MS Windows are based on the SQL/Services
API.
