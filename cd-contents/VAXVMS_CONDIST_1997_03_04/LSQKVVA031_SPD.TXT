   PRODUCT NAME:  DEC DB Integrator Gateway               SPD 63.35.02
                  for SequeLink[R], Version 3.1A

   DESCRIPTION

   DEC DB Integrator Gateway for SequeLink (SequeLink Gateway) provides
   applications and tools with direct, read/write access to data sources
   served by Version 2.5 or higher SequeLink servers. This access can be
   via interactive or dynamic SQL interfaces. Client/server access is en-
   abled by drivers for Microsoft[R] Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
   applications. Optional support for embedded SQL and SQL module lan-
   guage programming is available.

   DEC DB Integrator (DBI) extends the functionality of the SequeLink Gate-
   way by providing a native integration of databases accessed by SequeLink
   Gateways and other DB Integrator gateways. DBI clients may directly
   access and join views of tables existing on multiple databases. These
   views may be horizontally or vertically partitioned and be based on
   tables existing on any database accessible by these gateways. DBI views
   may be pre-defined or dynamically declared.

   DBI servers maintain a persistent catalog of metadata extracted from
   databases served by SequeLink servers. DBI uses this metadata along
   with information on network and underlying database manager capabil-
   ities to optimize cross-database joins.

   The SequeLink Gateway is available on the Digital UNIX[R] Operating
   System on AXP systems, workstations and servers and on the OpenVMS Op-
   erating System on Digital AXP and VAX systems, workstations and servers.

   DEC DB Integrator Gateway                             SPD 63.35.02
   for SequeLink[R], Version 3.1A

   The SequeLink Gateway provides direct, read/write access to SequeLink
   data sources through standard DEC SQL interfaces. These interfaces in-
   clude a dynamic SQL interface, an interactive SQL facility and the SQL/Services
   server.

   SQL data manipulation language (DML) is fully supported. SQL data def-
   inition language (DDL) support is limited to operations required to
   create and maintain tables and indexes and to grant and revoke access
   to database objects.

   The dynamic SQL interface compiles and executes SQL requests passed
   through its call interface. This programming approach is highly ef-
   fective in applications such as ad-hoc query access where the exact
   parameters of requests are not known until runtime. It is compatible
   with any programming language that supports the operating system's call-
   ing standards. The dynamic memory handling capabilities of Ada, C and
   PL/I enable these languages to take full advantage of the power and
   flexibility of this approach.

   The interactive SQL facility supports interactive query and update of
   data and management of table and view metadata in databases accessed
   via SequeLink servers. All required data format translations are per-
   formed automatically as part of handling requests to read and update
   data accessed by SequeLink servers.

   SequeLink Server Support

   The SequeLink Gateway provides access to information in CA-INGRES[R],
   INFORMIX-Online[R], INFORMIX-SE[R], ORACLE[R], IBM[R] DB2[TM] MVS IBMDB2/2
   IBMDB2/400 and IBM DB2/6000 databases through the SequeLink servers
   for those databases. Connectivity to a specific SequeLink server de-
   pends on the existence of a common network transport between the Se-
   queLink server platform and the SequeLink Gateway platform.

   Disk Space Requirements

   Table 1 lists the disk space required to install and operate SequeLink
   Gateway software by hardware/operating system platform (Platform). The
   common requirement represents the space required to store software ob-
   jects that are common to DBI and the DB Integrator family of gateways.
   If one of these products is already installed on the system or clus-
   ter, the disk space requirement will be decreased by this amount.

   Digital_UNIX___77,060______77,060_______73,260_____________________

   These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
   sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
   system environment, configuration, and software options selected.

   Additional space must be allowed for programs, logs, temporary database
   cache files and user interface software.

   CLUSTER ENVIRONMENT

   This product is fully supported when installed on any valid and li-
   censed VAXcluster or VMScluster configuration. These configurations
   are described in the VAXcluster SPD (SPD 29.78.xx), and the VMScluster
   SPD (SPD 42.18.xx).
