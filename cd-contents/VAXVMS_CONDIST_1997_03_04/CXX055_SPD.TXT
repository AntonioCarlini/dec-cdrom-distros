          PRODUCT NAME:  DEC C++ Version 5.5 for OpenVMS VAX     SPD 37.39.08
                         DEC C++ Version 5.5 for OpenVMS Alpha

          DESCRIPTION

          DEC C++ for OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha Operating Systems is a 
	  native programming language product that supports the C++ programming
          language. It includes:

          o  A C++ compiler that implements C++ as defined by The Annotated C++
             Reference Manual, Ellis & Stroustrup, reprinted with corrections
             in May 1991. The compiler implementation includes support for 
	     automatic instantiation of templates, as well as C++ exception 
	     handling. DEC C++ directly generates optimized object code without 
	     employing an intermediate translation to C.

          o  A subset of the ANSI C++ Standard Library, including the String 
             library, numeric_limits, auto_ptr and the Standard Template Library
             (STL) updated to the January 1996 ANSI C++ draft.

          o  A DEC C++ Class Library containing the following packages: 
	     iostream, complex, generic, objection, stopwatch, string, task, 
	     messages, and vector.

                                                                February 1997

 



          DEC C++ Version 5.5 for OpenVMS VAX                   SPD 37.39.08
          DEC C++ Version 5.5 for OpenVMS Alpha

          o  ANSI/ISO C header files enhanced for use with the DEC C++ compiler.
             These headers are currently packaged with DEC C++ to make them 
	     available for use with DEC C++. Packaging of the headers is 
	     subject to change as they become available in subsequent releases 
	     of related products.

          o  Features to facilitate porting to DEC C++ from other C++ 
	     implementations. The /STANDARD:CFRONT option relaxes error 
	     checking for better compatibility with C++ compilers based on the 
	     AT&T "cfront" translator. The /STANDARD:MS option provides better 
	     compatibility with Microsoft's Visual C++ (TM).

          o  Automatic instantiation of templates

          o  A name demangler that enables other tools (besides the compiler and
             debugger) to present demangled names to the user.

          DEC C++ documentation provides comprehensive reference and usage 
	  information for all product components. Online help is provided with 
	  the software, and Bookreader documents are provided on the Layered 
	  Products CD-ROM for the following manuals: Using DEC C++ on OpenVMS 
	  Systems, DEC C++ Installation Guide for OpenVMS Systems, and the DEC 
	  C++ Class Library Reference Manual.

          Hardcopy documentation is available by ordering the separate software
          documentation kit. The hardcopy documentation also includes a copy of
          an authoritative book on C++, the C++ Programming Language, 2nd 
	  edition, by Bjarne Stroustrup, and a copy of the STL Tutorial and 
	  Reference Guide, by David R. Musser and Atul Saini.

          Features

          o  Fast compilation and increased code optimization by directly 
	     translating C++ source programs to OpenVMS VAX and Alpha object 
	     files

          o  Extensive global and local optimizations of generated code for 
	     increased performance under OpenVMS

          o  Option for running only the preprocessor phase of compilation

          DEC C++ Version 5.5 for OpenVMS Alpha

             -  Support for DEC Language-Sensitive Editor to provide error 
	        diagnostics to the Editor

          Run-Time Library for C applications

          With the exception of OpenVMS VAX Operating System prior to Version
          6.1, the complete DEC C Run-Time Library that is needed for use with
          DEC C++ is distributed with both OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha 
	  Operating Systems. The DEC C Run-Time Library provides routines to 
	  perform input/output, character and string handling, mathematical 
	  computations, memory allocation, and emulation of selected UNIX(XAE)
	  features.  These routines are provided both in shared image and 
	  object module library form.

          DEC C++ Class Library

          With the exception of versions prior to 6.1 of the OpenVMS VAX 
	  Operating System, the DEC C++ Class-Library Run-Time components are 
	  distributed with OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha Operating Systems. The 
	  DEC C++ Class Library provides the following packages: iostream, 
	  complex, generic, objection, stopwatch, string, task, message and 
	  vector.

          Run-time Library Redistribution for Older OpenVMS VAX Operating Sys-
          tems

          For OpenVMS VAX Operating V5.5-2 - Version 6.0, the DEC C++ VAX kit
          includes a separately packaged saveset that contains additional or 
	  modified run-time library components needed to execute programs 
	  developed with the DEC C++ compiler and class libraries. Revisions 
	  to the run-time components are shipped with the OpenVMS Operating 
	  System rather than the DEC C++ compiler, and the components in this 
	  special DEC C++ saveset, or more recent replacements, are included 
	  with the OpenVMS Operating System for versions 6.1 or later.

          Digital grants you a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide right to
          reproduce and distribute this save-set portion of the DEC C++ kit 
	  designated as AACRT060.A (the "RTL") provided that you:

          o  distribute the entire RTL save set and copies of its accompanying
             installation documentation;

          o  distribute the RTL only in conjunction with and as part of your 
	     software application product which is designed to operate in the 
	     OpenVMS VAX environment;

	     software application product; and

          o  agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Digital from and 
	     against any claims or lawsuits, including attorney's fees, that 
	     arise or result from the use or distribution or your software 
	     application product. Except as expressly provided herein, Digital 
	     grants no implied or expressed license under any of its patents,

          system environment, configuration, and software options. The Debug kit
          saveset installation is not used on OpenVMS V6.0 systems, and the 
	  RunTime Kit saveset installation uses greatly reduced space on OpenVMS
          V6.0 systems.
