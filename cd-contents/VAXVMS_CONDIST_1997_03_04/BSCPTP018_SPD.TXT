 PRODUCT NAME:  VAX 2780/3780 Protocol Emulator, Version 1.8     SPD
 25.07.16

 DESCRIPTION

 The VAX 2780/3780 Protocol Emulator (PE) emulates the synchronous line
 protocol used by an IBM[R] 2780 or a 3780 Remote Batch Terminal. The
 emulator provides the OpenVMS user with a mechanism for transferring
 data between the OpenVMS Operating System and another system equipped
 to handle 2780 or 3780 communications protocols.

 The emulator can be invoked interactively or by a command procedure.
 The emulator's command set is designed to let several users share a
 communications line. With the appropriate modem options, the emula-
 tor can automatically answer incoming calls.

 Sophisticated operations can be performed by a combination of command
 procedures allowing, for example, unattended operation. Unattended op-
 erations include the ability to detect an incoming call, to establish
 the connection, and then to transmit and receive files and recover from
 transmission failures, all without the intervention of an operator.

 The PE supports several data formats; a particular format is selected
 via user command. Users can select various forms control translation
 schemes, variable record lengths or card images, ASCII/EBCDIC trans-
 lation, and BSC transparency. The OpenVMS record management facility
 performs all file I/O. Data can be sent to files representing print
 and punch streams; the format of data sent to one "stream" can dif-
 fer from the format of data sent to the other "stream".

 The following IBM remote batch terminal features are supported by the
 VAX 2780/3780 PE:

 o  2780 Extended and Multiple Record Option

                               DIGITAL                September 1994

                                                         AE-H994Q-TE

 

 o  Variable Horizontal Forms Control

 o  BSC Transparency

 o  3780 Space Compression

 o  BSC point-to-point configurations (multipoint is not supported)

 The product can concurrently run up to four physical lines, each with
 a different set of attributes (e.g., some can be 2780 lines, others
 3780), depending on the processor, at speeds between 1200 bps and 9600
 bps per line.

 INSTALLATION

 Digital recommends that a customer's first purchase of this software
 product include Digital Installation Services. These services provide
 for installation of the software product by an experienced Digital Soft-
 ware Specialist. A Network Profile must be prepared jointly by Dig-
 ital and the customer. This plan includes descriptions of the Digi-
 tal and IBM systems, the physical communications link(s), the appli-
 cation, the expected traffic, and the anticipated level of support re-
 quired.

 For subsequent purchases of this product only experienced customers
 should attempt installation. Digital recommends that all other cus-
 tomers purchase Digital's Installation Services.

 Digital's Installation Services can be purchased as a separate ser-
 vice.

 Customer Responsibilities

 Before installation of the software, the customer must:

 o  Previously have installed all requisite hardware including termi-
    nals;

 o  Obtain, install, and demonstrate as operational any modems and other
    equipment and facilities necessary to interface to Digital's com-
    munications equipment;

                                  2

 

 o  Demonstrate equivalency of operation for modems other than Bell Sys-
    tem 201C, 208A or 209A type modems, or in Europe, PTT approved modems;

 o  Provide a relevant file or job that can be submitted to the remote
    system to verify the installation of the software;

 o  Make available for a reasonable period of time, as mutually agreed
    by Digital and the customer, all hardware, communications facil-
    ities and terminals to be used during installation;

 o  Accept responsibility for proper operation of equipment and soft-
    ware not provided by Digital and for conformance of such equipment
    and software to the IBM specifications cited below.

 Delays caused by any failure to meet these responsibilities will be
 charged at the then prevailing rate for time and materials.
