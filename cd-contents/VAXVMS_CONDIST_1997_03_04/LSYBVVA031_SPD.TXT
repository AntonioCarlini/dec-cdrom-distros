   PRODUCT NAME:  DEC DB Integrator Gateway               SPD 47.35.04
                  for SYBASE[R], Version 3.1A

   DESCRIPTION

   DEC DB Integrator Gateway for SYBASE (SYBASE Gateway) provides appli-
   cations and tools with direct, read/write access to SYBASE SQL Server
   databases. This access can be via interactive or dynamic SQL inter-
   faces. Client/server access is enabled by drivers for Microsoft[R] Open
   Database Connectivity (ODBC) applications. Optional support for em-
   bedded SQL and SQL module language programming is available.

   DEC DB Integrator (DBI) extends the functionality of the SYBASE Gate-
   way by providing a native integration of SYBASE databases with data
   sources accessed by other DB Integrator gateways. DBI clients may di-
   rectly access and join views of tables existing on multiple databases.
   These views may be horizontally or vertically partitioned and be based
   on tables existing on any database accessible by DB Integrator gate-
   ways. These DBI views may be pre-defined or dynamically declared.

   DBI servers maintain a persistent catalog of metadata extracted from
   SYBASE databases. DBI uses this metadata along with information on net-
   work and underlying database manager capabilities to optimize cross-
   database joins.

   The SYBASE Gateway is available on the Digital UNIX[R] Operating Sys-
   tem on AXP systems, workstations and servers and on the OpenVMS Op-
   erating System on Digital AXP and VAX systems, workstations and servers.

   DEC DB Integrator Gateway                             SPD 47.35.04
   for SYBASE[R], Version 3.1A

   The SYBASE Gateway provides direct, read/write access to SYBASE SQL
   Server databases through standard DEC SQL interfaces. These interfaces
   include a dynamic SQL interface, an interactive SQL facility and the
   SQL/Services server.

   SQL data manipulation language (DML) is fully supported. SQL data def-
   inition language (DDL) support is limited to operations required to
   create and maintain tables and indexes and to grant and revoke access
   to database objects.

   The dynamic SQL interface compiles and executes SQL requests passed
   through its call interface. This programming approach is highly ef-
   fective in applications such as ad-hoc query access where the exact
   parameters of requests are not known until runtime. It is compatible
   with any programming language that supports the host operating sys-
   tem calling standards. The dynamic memory handling capabilities of Ada,
   C and PL/I enable these languages to take full advantage of the power
   and flexibility of this approach.

   The interactive SQL facility supports interactive query and update of
   data and management of table and view metadata in SYBASE SQL Server
   databases. All data format translations are performed automatically
   by the SYBASE Gateway as part of handling requests to read and update
   data.

   Desktop Connectivity

   The SYBASE Gateway includes ODBC drivers for Microsoft Windows[TM] and
   Windows NT[TM]. These drivers enable read/write access to databases
   via SYBASE servers over DECnet, TCP/IP and Novell[R] NetWare[R] (IPX
   /SPX) transports. Network transport alternatives depend on the selected
   desktop and SYBASE Gateway platforms. [1]

   Distributed Data Access

   The SYBASE Gateway supports access from remote clients and to remote
   SYBASE SQL Server databases.

   ____________________
 [1] ODBC client access via the Novell NetWare (IPX/SPX) transport is sup-

     ported only by SYBASE Gateways running on OpenVMS VAX platforms

   Performance

   The SYBASE Gateway selects access strategies that minimize data trans-
   fer activity. Wherever possible, selection, filtering, and statisti-
   cal operations are done by the SYBASE SQL Server RDBMS. A log of com-
   munications activity and errors may be maintained to assist in prob-
   lem isolation and evaluation.

   Disk Space Requirements

   Table 1 lists the disk space required to install and operate SYBASE
   Gateway software by hardware/operating system platform (Platform). The
   common requirement represents the space required to store software ob-
   jects that are common to DBI and the DB Integrator family of gateways.
   If one of these products is already installed on the system or clus-
   ter, the permanent disk space requirement will be decreased by this
   amount.

   These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
   sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
   system environment, configuration, and software options selected.

   Additional space must be allowed for programs, logs, temporary database
   cache files and user interface software.
