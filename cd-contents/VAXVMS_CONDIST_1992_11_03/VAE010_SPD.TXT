 DECvoiceBuilder Application Editor

 DECvoiceBuilder Application Editor provides a Graphical User Inter-
 face (GUI) that is used to describe the application. This is achieved
 by drawing a diagram composed of objects. Each object represents one
 step in the application. Connections are made between the objects to
 indicate the flow of the application. Once the application is created,
 it can be saved for later modifications or turned into a running ap-
 plication through simple menu options.

 DECvoiceBuilder Application Editor objects provide the following func-
 tions.

 o  PHONE objects:

    -  Answer a telephone call

    -  Hang-up a telephone call

    -  Transfer a call to another phone number

    -  Transfer a current call to another application

    -  Dial a specified phone number

    -  Place the current call on hold

    -  Retrieve a call that was put on hold

 o  MESSAGE objects:

    -  Play a message to a caller

    -  Record a message from a caller

 o  DTMF (Touch-Tone[TM]) objects:

    -  Send a sequence of DTMF tones to a caller or to a called num-
       ber

    -  Collect DTMF input from a caller and place it in a specified buffer

    -  Provide a menu that collects a single DTMF key or voice-recognized
       digit from the caller and dispatches program execution to the
       network branch associated with that key

                                  2

 

 o  LOOKUP objects:

    -  Retrieve data from a table

    -  Open a database

    -  Perform a predefined database operation

    -  Close a database

 o  PIN (Personal Identification Number) objects:

    -  Collect user identification information to check authorization

    -  Allow a user to update PIN information

 o  CABINET objects:

    -  Open a specified cabinet

    -  Open the specified folder in the currently opened cabinet

    -  Select the message to be played, filed, or deleted

    -  File a message to the specified cabinet and folder

    -  Play a message from the currently opened cabinet and folder

    -  Delete a message from the currently opened cabinet and folder

 o  CONFIRMATION objects:

    -  Collect a "yes" or "no" recognition response from the caller

 o  SPEAK objects:

    -  Cause the specified text to be spoken to the caller using syn-
       thesized speech

    -  Create a look-up for correct name or address pronunciation

 o  CONTROL objects:

    -  Mark the start of an application

    -  Mark the end of an application

    -  Connect one branch of the application to another branch

                                  3

 

    -  Perform a decision operation based on two specified values

    -  Create a new buffer containing a specified value or modify the
       value in a current buffer

    -  Increment the value in the specified buffer

    -  Specify the input style, DTMF, or voice recognition

    -  Specify that alternate prompts, based on language or skill set,
       are to be spoken to the caller

    -  Use the default error path

 o  USER objects:

    -  Allow the execution of a specified user routine

    -  Allow the execution of a specified user command procedure

 DECvoiceBuilder Recording Studio

 The DECvoiceBuilder Recording Studio provides the ability to create
 and maintain the digitized voice recordings used as prompts for an ap-
 plication. Multiple variations of a prompt can be created for the same
 application, allowing an application to have multiple language sup-
 port or have prompts based on the caller's skill level (such as novice
 and expert prompts).

 The following capabilities are part of the DECvoiceBuilder Recording
 Studio:

 o  Production of recording scripts

 o  Graphical display for editing recordings that allow:

    -  Cutting and pasting segments of recordings

    -  Trimming unwanted silence from recordings

 o  Support for compound prompts, where variable information is parsed
    as part of the output.

 DECvoiceBuilder Administrator

                                  4

 

 DECvoiceBuilder Administrator provides for the monitoring and manag-
 ing of the applications and the configuration of the physical resources
 required for them to run. DECvoiceBuilder Administrator consists of
 two subcomponents, the Resource Manager and the Application Manager.

 The Resource Manager is used to deploy the application generated by
 the DECvoiceBuilder Application Editor. It builds a database that con-
 sists of information such as telephone resource configuration and voice
 resource availability required by an application. This information is
 specified by the user.

 The Application Manager runs the applications in a production envi-
 ronment. It initializes voice hardware, performs license management,
 assigns physical voice resources to the application at run time, and
 starts and stops the voice applications. The Application Manager also
 manages the reporting of status, error, and operator messages via win-
 dows, and generates statistics and report information.

 DECvoiceBuilder Run-Time Library

 DECvoiceBuilder Run-Time Library component provides the routines the
 DECvoiceBuilder Application Editor utilizes when it generates an ap-
 plication.

 The Run-Time Library component consists of two separate libraries, the
 application support library and the text debug library. The applica-
 tion support library contains the code that interfaces to the voice
 devices. The text debug library contains the code that runs the ap-
 plication to the terminal screen by displaying prompts and messages,
 and receiving keyboard input.

 SOURCE CODE INFORMATION

 The following source code modules are provided on magnetic distribu-
 tion media:

 o  Prototype demo-application modules that are intended to demonstrate
    and assist users in their implementations of various voice appli-
    cations. These modules are supplied without warranties.

                                  5

 

 o  A set of prompt libraries for the above prototype demo-application
    modules. These libraries are intended to assist users in applica-
    tion development only.

 Digital provides these source code modules on an  ``as is'' basis with
 no support.
