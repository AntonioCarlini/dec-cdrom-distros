 PRODUCT NAME:  DECwindows Graphical Interface Tools    SPD 32.27.01
                for VMS, Version 1.0

 DESCRIPTION

 The DECwindows Graphical Interface Tools are widgets which provide ad-
 vanced programming capabilities for developers of applications based
 on OSF/Motif®, allowing customers to easily create graphical WYSIWYG
 (What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get) applications. This product is avail-
 able separately or as a component of the DECwindows Tools Package for
 Motif® (QP-LAXAA-AA), which provides a rich set of development tools
 for developers of Motif applications. Also included in this package
 are DEC VUIT V2.0 and LinkWorks Developer's Tools V1.0. The applica-
 tion deployment environment for applications written using the DECwin-
 dows Graphical Interface Tools and/or the LinkWorks Developer's Tools
 is included with VMS DECwindows Motif V1.0 at no additional charge.

 DECwindows Graphical Interface Tools consist of:

 Graphical Object Editor (GObE) - A 2D graphics widget which allows ap-
 plications to create and manipulate objects in a world coordinate sys-
 tem. GObE supports a full range of dynamic actions including move, zoom,
 scroll, scale, rotate, and rubberband. GObE also provides EXTRACT and
 PASTE and hardcopy output using DDIF (Digital Document Interchange For-
 mat).

 Network Editor (NetEd) - A 2D graphics widget which provides the abil-
 ity to lay out networks of nodes and connections. NetEd stores net-
 work data in its own internal database and provides network traver-
 sal as well as automatic tree/precedence layout. It is designed to be
 used by applications that need to express complex relationships in the
 form of networks (directed graphs). Additionally, NetEd is layered on
 top of GObE and provides all the capabilities of GObE.
