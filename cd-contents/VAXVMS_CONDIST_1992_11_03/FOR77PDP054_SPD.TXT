Product Name:  PDP-11 FORTRAN-77/VAX to RSX, Version 5.4	SPD 26.16.08

DESCRIPTION

PDP-11 FORTRAN-77/VAX to RSX is a compatibility mode compiler intended to run 
on VMS under VAX-11 RSX. Source programs can be compiled under VAX-11 RSX and 
the object modules then transported to an RSX system for taskbuilding and 
execution.  The ability to taskbuild the transported object modules requires 
the presence of FORTRAN-77/RSX OTS, Version 5.3 on the target system.

PDP-11 FORTRAN-77/VAX to RSX is an extended implementation of the ANSI subset 
FORTRAN-77 standard (X3.9-1978) that runs on the VMS Operating System. PDP-11 
FORTRAN-77/VAX to RSX contains all the features of the ANSI FORTRAN-77 subset, 
many of the full-set language features, and extensions that are not included in 
the ANSI FORTRAN-77 standard. Switch selectable support is provided for 
programs based on the previous ANSI FORTRAN standard (X3.9-1966).

PDP-11 FORTRAN-77/VAX to RSX meets the Federal Information Processing Standard 
Publication (FIPS PUB-69) requirement for ANSI compliance and for a flagger. 
The flagger optionally produces diagnostic messages for syntax and/or source 
form elements that do not conform to the full-level ANSI FORTRAN X3.9-1978 
standard.

PDP-11 FORTRAN-77/VAX to RSX programs can be optionally executed under the 
control of PDP-11 Symbolic Debugger/VAX to RSX (SPD 26.75.xx). Execution of 
application programs using PDP-11 Symbolic Debugger/VAX to RSX aids in the 
location of programming errors in successfully compiled programs that behave 
abnormally when executed.

PDP-11 FORTRAN-77/VAX to RSX includes all subset ANSI features including:

oo   CHARACTER data type

oo   Block IF construct, including IF...THEN, ELSE IF, ELSE, and END IF 
    statements, for conditional execution of blocks of statements

The PDP-11 FORTRAN-77/VAX to RSX compiler includes the following 
features of full-language FORTRAN as defined by the ANSI Standard: 

oo   Double precision and complex data types

oo   Intrinsic functions, including LEN, ICHAR, and INDEX

oo   Exponentiation forms, including double precision and complex

oo   Format edit descriptors, including S, SP, SS, T, TL, TR, Iw.m, and 
    Gw.dEe

oo   Generalized DO LOOP parameters

oo   WHILE and END DO logic parameters

oo   Generic function selection based on argument data type for 
    FORTRAN-defined functions

oo   Lower and upper bounds specification in array declarators

oo   Substrings of character variables and character array elements

oo   Optional syntax for I/O statements (UNIT= and FMT=)

oo   Support for real and complex constant expressions in PARAMETER 
    statement

oo   IMPLICIT NONE statement

PDP-11 FORTRAN-77/VAX to RSX includes the following extensions to the 
ANSI Standard: 

oo   Language elements for keyed and sequential access to RMS multi-key 
    ISAM files

oo   DEFINE FILE, FIND, DELETE, REWRITE, and UNLOCK statements

oo   TYPE and ACCEPT input/output statements

oo   Comments permitted at the end of each source line

oo   INCLUDE statement

oo   BYTE data type

oo   ENCODE, DECODE statements

oo   Explicit specification of storage allocation units for data types 
    (e.g., INTEGER *4)

oo   Hexadecimal and octal constants

oo   Virtual array support for systems with memory management directives. 
    Virtual arrays are memory-resident and require enough main memory to 
    contain all elements of all arrays.

oo   User mode instruction and data space (I & D space) support on 
    processors where both the hardware and software support this 
    feature

oo   O and Z format edit descriptors

The PDP-11 FORTRAN-77/VAX to RSX compiler performs optimization on 
source code to improve execution-time on a PDP-11 with a floating point 
processor. PDP-11 FORTRAN-77/VAX to RSX compiler optimizations include:

oo   Optimizations of arithmetic and logical IF statements

oo   Common subexpression elimination

oo   Removal of invariant expressions from DO loops

oo   Allocation of processor registers across block IF constructs and DO 
    loops

Object Time System

The PDP-11 FORTRAN-77/VAX to RSX Object Time System (OTS) is a set of 
object modules that are selectively linked with compiler-produced object 
modules by the operating system's task builder, to produce a task 
(program) ready for execution. 

PDP-11 FORTRAN-77/VAX to RSX provides the capability of creating either 
or both of the following Object Time systems: 

oo   The OTS based on File Control Services (FCS) allows sequential and 
    random access to sequentially organized files.

oo   The OTS based on Record Management Services (RMS) uses RMS to 
    provide access to sequential, relative, and indexed organization 
    files.

The RMS OTS is normally larger than the FCS OTS, but provides additional 
capabilities. For a given task, it is not possible to mix FCS OTS 
modules with RMS OTS modules.

Compatibility

PDP-11 FORTRAN-77/VAX to RSX, Version 5.4 is equivalent to PDP-11 
FORTRAN-77/RSX, Version 5.4. FORTRAN-77 programs, which are executed 
under control of PDP-11 Symbolic Debugger/VAX To RSX may not execute 
identically on RSX.
