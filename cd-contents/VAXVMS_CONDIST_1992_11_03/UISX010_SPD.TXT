           PRODUCT NAME:  VAXuisx and VWS Migration     SPD 33.58.00
                          Tools Kit, Version 1.0

           DESCRIPTION

           VAXuisx Run-Time Library for VMS Version 1.1 allows most ex-
           isting applications written for the VWS windowing system to
           run under the DECwindows windowing system. VAXuisx accom-
           plishes this by providing a new run-time library that uses
           the Xlib program interface for drawing and input services.
           UIS routines are redirected to the new UISXSHR run-time im-
           age. Therefore, most applications do not need to relink or
           install native VWS.

           Features

           o  Emulates most VWS routines by using X11 (Does not emu-
              late DOP's, common video QIO interfaces, tablets or shared
              color maps).

           o  Emulates VWS virtual color maps by using X11 routines.

           o  Supports all of the VWS writing modes.

           o  The standard VWS patterns are built into VAXuisx.

           o  Provides the standard VWS fonts in DECwindows format.

           SIGHT (Simple Interactive Graphics Handling Tool), Version
           4.4 - This package enables the user to create graphics on
           a workstation. These graphics are stored in files for graphic
           output to hardcopy devices. These files can then be updated
           and/or transferred/copied to other supported VAXstations.

           Version 1.0

           HardCopy UIS (HCUIS), Version 4.4 - For applications requir-
           ing the generation of hardcopy output of graphics, Hardcopy
           UIS (HCUIS) is provided. HCUIS enables applications to trans-
           late VWS display lists to the formats needed to print them
           on a variety of hardcopy devices. The HCUIS routines also
           enable applications to create UIS files from the VWS dis-
           play list. The HCUIS DCL interface also enables users to trans-
           late UIS files to the formats needed to print them on a va-
           riety of hardcopy devices.

           UIS to DDIF Converter, Version 2.1 - This tool allows the
           conversion of UIS metafiles created by Hardcopy UIS (this
           includes SIGHT files) into any output format supported by
           the CDA Converter Library.

           UIS Source Code Annotator, Version 2.0 - The UIS Source Code
           Annotator helps to migrate VWS applications to DECwindows.
           It gives information which can be used in porting VWS ap-
           plications to DECwindows. By running a VWS application through
           the Annotator, you can learn which UIS routines have equiv-
           alent Xlib routines and what those routines are. You also
           can learn which UIS routines have no equivalent Xlib rou-
           tines. The Annotator should be used along with A Guide to
           Migrating VWS Applications to DECwindows.

           A Guide to Migrating VWS Applications to DECwindows, Ver-
           sion 1.0 - This document provides information to aid soft-
           ware developers and architects in migrating existing VWS ap-
           plications to the DECwindows platform by pointing out the
           differences between the two platforms and by providing pro-
           gramming examples in a ported application written specif-
           ically for this purpose.

           VWS Demo Kit, Version 4.4 - The VWS Demo kit V4.4 is a col-
           lection of VWS applications written in a variety of languages.
           Most of these demonstration programs include both source code
           and executables as part of the kit.
