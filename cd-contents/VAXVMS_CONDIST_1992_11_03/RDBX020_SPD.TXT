 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC RdbExpert for VMS, Version 2.0      SPD 31.72.01

 DESCRIPTION

 DEC RdbExpert for VMS is a DECwindows Motif[R] and command-line-based
 expert system database tuning tool designed to reduce the time and ef-
 fort required to produce tuned VAX Rdb/VMS physical database storage
 designs. DEC RdbExpert for VMS is intended to help database design-
 ers and administrators during the initial design and subsequent main-
 tenance phases of database development. DEC RdbExpert for VMS expands
 the tuning capabilities of less experienced database administrators
 while improving overall DBA tuning productivity.

 DEC RdbExpert for VMS gathers information of importance encompassing
 logical level input related to physical design. DEC RdbExpert for VMS
 bases its design recommendations on this logical schema information,
 as well as the system environment, database record volumes, and trans-
 action workload information. DEC RdbExpert for VMS makes extensive use
 of import functions which enables users to quickly provide the required
 data. For example, DEC RdbExpert for VMS can import DECtrace trans-
 action workload data captured directly from running VAX Rdb/VMS databases
 for use in the design process, thus creating designs based upon the
 actual workload executing against existing databases. The DBA then re-
 views this input and modifies it where necessary to ensure an accu-
 rate reflection of the actual run-time requirements.

 DEC RdbExpert for VMS generates storage designs in the form of the SQL
 Data Definition Language statements for VAX Rdb/VMS. It also gener-
 ates executable storage design creation procedures as well as the VAX
 Rdb/VMS RMU/LOAD and UNLOAD scripts used to unload existing data and
 reload into the redesigned database. In addition, DEC RdbExpert for
 VMS generates design reports to educate the DBA about the design pro-
 cess and the database tuning rules.

 The DEC RdbExpert for VMS knowledge base is cognizant of the VAX Rdb/VMS
 database system internals, tuning rules, and run-time optimizer heuris-
 tics. DEC RdbExpert for VMS uses this knowledge to help the DBA ar-
 rive at the performance tuned design.

 Features

 DEC RdbExpert for VMS provides a DECwindows Motif interface, taking
 advantage of the advanced user interface capabilities of that envi-
 ronment. DEC RdbExpert for VMS also provides a full-function, command-
 line interface for non-DECwindows environments.

 Using DEC RdbExpert for VMS, a database designer/administrator can:

 o  Import complete VAX Rdb/VMS database logical and physical schemas
    into the DEC RdbExpert design repository from the Rdb rootfile and
    SQL text file.

 o  Enter the database transaction workload information using one or
    more of the following methods:

    -  Using workload information captured by DECtrace

    -  Through a text file containing the VAX SQL-like Physical Design
       Language (PDL) created by the DBA

    -  Through SQL MODULE language files

    -  Through the DECwindows interface

 o  Append separate workloads.

 o  View and edit the workload data modifying or entering cycle, fre-
    quency, and importance information for the various workload ele-
    ments of the database applications, that is, applications, programs,
    and transactions with their accompanying data manipulation language
    (DML) requests.

 o  Segregate workload into dynamic and pre-compiled workloads in the
    same physical design.

                                  2

 

 o  Enter the database volume and occurrence information by one or more
    of the following methods:

    -  From the VAX Rdb/VMS root file and tables

    -  Through a text file containing the volume information created
       by the DBA

    -  Through the DECwindows interface

 o  Apply volatility ratings - how frequently the data is added, mod-
    ified, or deleted, to the schema at both the relation (record) and
    column (field) levels.

 o  Define system environment for the target database, including:

    -  Available space and priority ranking per disk

    -  AIJ and RUJ placement

    -  Device logical names and directories

 o  Catalog multiple logical designs, each with one or more physical
    designs with which it is associated.

 o  Generate the design reports that identify the input assumptions and
    design information for the recommended parameters and database de-
    sign as well as educate the user regarding the design rules and choices.

 o  Generate a DECtrace statistics report.

 o  Create VAX Rdb/VMS logical and physical designs consisting of SQL
    logical and physical DDL, and creation and run-time parameters, as
    well as the .COM procedure to execute these designs.

 o  Validate logical and physical schemas when the Graphical Schema Ed-
    itor is installed.

 o  Create RMU/UNLOAD - LOAD scripts to unload and load the VAX Rdb/VMS
    data into the redesigned databases.
