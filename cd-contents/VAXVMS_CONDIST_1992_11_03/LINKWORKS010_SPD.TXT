 DESCRIPTION

 The LinkWorks Developer's Tools for VMS is a set of development tools
 for creating, modifying, and maintaining hyperapplications. A hyper-
 application is an application that participates in a DECwindows LinkWorks
 environment. Hyperapplications provide linking and navigation capa-
 bilities to application end users through a new Link menu. LinkWorks
 support can be added to existing applications, and new applications
 can be designed with LinkWorks support included from the beginning.

 This LinkWorks Developer's Tools release includes the following com-
 ponents:

 o  LinkWorks Services definitions

 o  Linkable LinkWorks Services

 o  Linkbase Utility (LBASE)

 o  HyperFiles sample hyperapplication (source files and build proce-
    dure)

 o  LinkWorks Developer's Guide

 The LinkWorks Services definitions are the application programming in-
 terfaces (APIs) in a variety of programming languages; C, Ada, FOR-
 TRAN, and Pascal.*

 *  The non-C language bindings are not supported in this version. Only
    the C-language bindings are supported.
