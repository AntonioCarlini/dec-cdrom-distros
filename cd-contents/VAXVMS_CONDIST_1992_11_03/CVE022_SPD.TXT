 PRODUCT NAME:  DECview3D Concurrent View and Edit for VMS[*],   SPD
 31.35.02                Version 2.2

 DESCRIPTION

 The DECview3D Concurrent View and Edit Module for VMS allows two or
 more users of the DECview3D software, linked by DECnet communications,
 to work simultaneously on the same DECview3D layout file. Users of the
 Concurrent View and Edit software have access to all DECview3D func-
 tions and pass control of the application back and forth. The results
 of all application operations are displayed on all users' DECwindows
 workstations.

 DECview3D is a software tool used for display, review, markup, anal-
 ysis, and manipulation of engineering graphics created by CAD (Com-
 puter Aided Design) packages. It combines data translation, snapshot
 generation and LiveLinks to the DECwrite Compound Document Editor. DECview3D
 can be used to integrate engineering graphics into other applications,
 or as a standalone tool for display and review of those graphics. Re-
 fer to DECview3D for VMS Software Product Description (SPD 26.95.xx)
 for a complete product description.

 The DECview3D Concurrent View and Edit Module for VMS facilitates the
 review of engineering designs among distributed work groups and team
 members.

 DECview3D Concurrent View and Edit Module for VMS runs under VMS DECwin-
 dows and adheres to the XUI Style Guide. It has the same look and feel
 as other Digital developed DECwindows applications.

 The Originator is the user who starts the DECview3D Concurrent View
 and Edit session. Each additional user to join the CVE session is re-
 ferred to as a Concurrent User.

 The following qualifiers can be used by the Originator when starting
 the session:

 o  /FILE specifies the file to be viewed. The software prompts the user
    for a filename if none is specified.

 o  /[NO]COPY_FILE determines whether the DECview3D layout file to be
    viewed will be copied from the Originator's directory to the Con-
    current Users' directories.

 o  /NODE specifies the node on which another concurrent session will
    run. This can be specified as a valid node name or DECnet address.
    The DECview3D Concurrent View and Edit module prompts the user for
    a node name if none is specified. Only one Concurrent User can be
    specified in this manner.

 o  The /DISPLAY /SERVER and /SCREEN qualifiers can be used to spec-
    ify the display, server, or screen where the concurrent session will
    be displayed.

 o  /USER specifies the Concurrent Users by their predefined alias names.
    Alias names can also be selected from a dialog box and saved for
    future sessions.

 Concurrent Users

 The Concurrent Users participate in the DECview3D concurrent session
 and can request control of the application at any time using the con-
 trol box. DECview3D Concurrent View and Edit checks that the DECview3D
 files being viewed are identical.

 Log Files

 DECview3D Concurrent View and Edit maintains a log file of each con-
 current session. This log file includes the date and time the concur-
 rent session started, the Originator's node and name, each Concurrent

                                  2

 

 User's node, and the name(s) of the file(s) being viewed. During a con-
 current session, any user may enter text into the Log File via the con-
 trol box. Log files can be edited using a standard text editor.

 Application Control

 Users take turns controlling the application. Control of the DECview3D
 software is first owned by the Originator of the session. The control
 box appears on all users' screens for the duration of the concurrent
 session, and indicates which user can execute DECview3D commands. Con-
 trol can be requested by and passed to other users in the session.
