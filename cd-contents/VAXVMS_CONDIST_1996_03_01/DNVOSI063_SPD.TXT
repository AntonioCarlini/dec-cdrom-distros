 PRODUCT NAME:  DECnet/OSI Version 6.3 for OpenVMS VAX  SPD 25.03.38

 DESCRIPTION

 DECnet/OSI V6.3 for OpenVMS VAX is an implementation of Phase V of the
 Digital Network Architecture (DNA) for the OpenVMS Operating System
 for VAX hardware. DECnet/OSI integrates DECnet and OSI network pro-
 tocols allowing both stacks to share integrated network functions up
 to the Transport Layer. Upper Layers have been implemented as sepa-
 rate "towers" allowing existing DECnet and OSI applications to share
 the integrated Transport Layer. Existing DECnet Phase IV and new DEC-
 net and OSI applications are supported by DECnet/OSI. In combination
 with TCP/IP protocol stacks, OpenVMS systems can participate in mul-
 tivendor, multiprotocol networks adhering to Open Networking standards.

 DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS features include:

 o  The ability to configure all members of a cluster from a single work-
    station

 o  The ability to generate an OpenVMS audit event when a connection
    is established

 o  OSI Application Programming Interfaces, formerly offered as a sep-
    arate product

 o  A new OSI Session Layer programming interface (SPI)

 o  The ability to run DECnet and OSI applications over TCP/IP trans-
    ports

 o  Expanded naming options, allowing the use of a new and larger lo-
    cal namespace, DECdns, and/or DNS/bind as naming services

                                                       November 1995

                                                         AE-NJ32P-TE

 

 o  The Graphical Network Management User Interface for improved net-
    work management.

 o  Routing Segregated Mode to allow the routing layer to choose a Phase
    IV router for those packets having a Phase IV compatible address.
    (Packets having a Phase V extended address will be sent to a Phase
    V router by default.) This is a configurable option.

 o  Reverse Path Caching to capture path information for later use in
    reaching remote systems.

 o  Increased network size, supported through the use of ISO OSI ad-
    dressing.

 o  Simplified Installation and Configuration process

 o  The Network Control Language (NCL). Network management is based on
    DNA CMIP, Digital's implementation of the OSI international stan-
    dard Common Management Information Protocol.

 o  An NCP Emulator to facilitate installation of Layered Products writ-
    ten for DECnet Phase IV.

 o  Installation using the POLYCENTER Software Installation utility.

 o  Network naming, allowing the use of either Local Naming or fully
    distributed name services.

 o  Support for topologies using multicircuit and multihomed end nodes

 o  Dynamic connections over X.25 networks.

 o  OSI implementation in accordance with current US and UK GOSIP re-
    quirments:

    -  Application, Presentation, and Session Layers

       .  File Transfer Access and Management (FTAM) application

       .  Virtual Terminal application

          network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), and X.25

       .  LLC2 for CONS over LAN

       .  Data Link Layer, supporting HDLC for wide area communications,
          ISO 8802-3 (Ethernet CSMA/CD) and FDDI LANs, and DDCMP for
          backwards compatibility. HDLC support includes the LAPB pro-
          tocol for X.25 communications.

       .  Physical Layer, with CSMA/CD, HDLC, and FDDI devices supported.

 DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS is available in two forms: End System and Ex-
 tended Function. Extended Function provides all the features of End
 System plus the OSI Application Gateways (FTAM - DAP gateway, VT-Telnet,
 VT-LAT), the DECdns Server, the OSI Application Programming Interfaces
 and Cluster Alias. See the SOFTWARE LICENSING section for more details.

 DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS offers task-to-task communications, file man-
 agement, downline system and task loading, network command terminals,
 and network resource sharing capabilities using DNA, ISO and TCP/IP
 protocols. DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS communicates with adjacent and non-
 adjacent DECnet Phase IV, PATHWORKS, DECnet/OSI implementations on other
 OpenVMS, ULTRIX, and Digital UNIX systems, as well as OpenVMS systems
 running TCP/IP transports.

 OpenVMS programs written in native mode programming languages can use
 DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS capabilities.

 Depending on the system configuration, networks combining DECnet/OSI
 for OpenVMS systems with other DECnet, OSI and TCP/IP products may limit
 the functions available if all products do not support equal features.

                                  3

 

 Data Link Layer

 DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS uses synchronous, asynchronous, Ethernet, and
 FDDI communications controllers to interface with other network nodes.

 LAN connectivity is provided by the CSMA/CD and FDDI controllers and
 drivers supporting ISO 8802-2 Logical Link Control (LLC) type 1 con-
 nectionless service and ISO 8802-3 LLC Type 2. DECnet/OSI also sup-
 ports Ethernet V2 packets on CSMA/CD devices.

 Use of FDDI packets larger than 1500 bytes requires a Phase V router
 on the FDDI LAN. As with Cluster Alias support, the Phase V router may
 be configured to run the Phase IV distance vector routing protocol or
 the Phase V link state routing protocol.

 WAN connectivity is provided by Optional X.25 software supporting host-
 based synchronous communications interfaces.

 Supported synchronous devices allow for the use of DDCMP, DEC-HDLC,
 LAPB/E and SDLC protocols. BISYNC and GENBYTE protocols are also sup-
 ported on some options. WAN Device Drivers are required by X.25 to es-
 tablish host-based wide area connections.

 Synchronous controllers use DDCMP or HDLC, either when directly con-
 nected or when connected via modems, to provide full- or half-duplex
 communications over point-to-point lines. Synchronous DDCMP Multipoint
 tributary connections are also supported. Asynchronous controllers use
 DDCMP, either when directly connected or when connected via modems,
 to provide only full duplex communications over point-to-point lines.
 Error correcting and data suppression modems are not supported.

 Asynchronous lines are supported only to other
 systems running DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS VAX,
 DECnet-VAX, DECnet-RSX, and DECnet-DOS.

 DDCMP operation is not supported in cases where an asynchronous phys-
 ical communications line is emulated by lower-level protocols or com-
 munications subsystems. Examples of this include X.29 virtual termi-
 nals, asynchronous connections as emulated by terminal servers, and
 connections via data switches.

                                  4

 

 DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS allows up to four circuits to be defined and
 operational on an End System. This capability allows a single end sys-
 tem to be connected to up to four separate LANs or WANs. It is rec-
 ommended that the circuits be equal in capacity and connectivity.

 X.25

 The DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS VAX license includes the right to use X.25
 Access software, formerly known as VAX P.S.I. Access. The right to use
 X.25 Native mode software, formerly known as VAX P.S.I., requires an
 additional license. See the OPTIONAL SOFTWARE section of this SPD for
 ordering information. The X.25 software in DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS is
 backwards compatible with systems running the older VAX P.S.I. prod-
 ucts. Applications written to the older P.S.I. interfaces will con-
 tinue to run, unchanged, with the X.25 software supported on DECnet
 /OSI.

 The X.25 native software allows suitably configured DECnet/OSI sys-
 tems to connect to Packet Switching Data Networks (PSDNs) conforming
 to CCITT recommendation X.25 (1980 or 1984) and/or to International
 Standards (ISO) 7776 and 8208. This allows a DECnet/OSI system to func-
 tion as Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) or be addressed as Data Circuit
 Terminating Equipment (DCE) as follows:

 o  A packet mode DTE connected to a supported PSDN (supported PSDNs
    are listed in Table 4) conforming to CCITT Recommendation X.25 (1980,
    1984)

 o  A packet-mode DTE connected to a CSMA/CD LAN conforming to ISO 8802-
    3 using ISO Logical Link Control Type 2 (LLC2) as specified in ISO
    8881

 o  A packet-mode DTE/DCE connected to a DCE/DTE conforming to ISO 7776
    and 8208

 X.25 can be configured for Native operation to support direct connec-
 tions from a VAX system to one or more PSDNs, each of which may have
 one or more DTEs. It also allows communication with any non-Digital


                                  5

 

 X.25 system on the same LAN that supports the ISO Logical Link Con-
 trol Type 2 (LLC2) protocol.

 X.25 Access Software

 The X.25 access software uses a connector node to provide the phys-
 ical connection to a PSDN. A connector node can be an X25router 100
 /2000 (SPD 28.86.xx), a DEC X25gateway 100/500 (SPD 32.97.xx), DEC-
 nis router (SPD 36.95.xx), among others.

 DECnet/OSI logical links are established by OpenVMS to connect the X.25
 Access system to the X.25 Connector system. These links may use any
 supported DECnet/OSI communications path between the X.25 Access sys-
 tem and the Connector system, provided they themselves do not use an
 X.25 connection. X.25 Access uses these links to transmit X.25 or X.29
 messages between the Connector system and the X.25 Access system.

 Note that successful use of an X.29 connection, either for incoming
 X.29 calls or by means of the host-based PAD utility supplied with X.25
 Access, depends on the DECnet/OSI circuit between the Access and Con-
 nector system having a low response time. This requires high-speed DEC-
 net/OSI connections and few intermediate routing systems.

 A single X.25 Access system can connect to one or more Connector sys-
 tems concurrently, and hence access all PSDN(s) accessible from those
 Connector systems. When X.25 Access is used, one of these Connector
 systems/PSDN combinations must be established as the default gateway
 for outbound and inbound traffic.

 Features

 The X.25 software provides the Connection Oriented Network Service to
 allow mapping between a destination NSAP address and a destination DTE
 address according to ISO 8348.

 The X.25 software can be used in the following ways:

 o  Process-to-process (X.25) communications

 o  Process-to-terminal (X.29) communications

                                  6

 

 o  Terminal-to-Process (X.29) communications

 Process-to-process (X.25) Communications

 The X.25 software provides access for OpenVMS user programs written
 in VAX MACRO and high-level languages such as VAX FORTRAN. Programs
 executing in PDP-11 compatibility mode are not supported.

 The X.25 programming interface allows application programs to access
 the service interface to the packet level by means of the standard Open-
 VMS QIO interface. Functions include the setting up and breaking of
 network connections, data transmission and reception, sending and re-
 ceiving of interrupt messages, and resetting of virtual circuits The
 interface allows splitting and recombining of messages which are longer
 than the packet size selected for the circuit.

 The X.25 programming interface enables an application program using
 OpenVMS System Services to communicate with complementary software on
 other systems (Digital or non-Digital DTEs) accessible through the X.25
 connection.

 Process-to-terminal and Terminal-to-process (X.29) Communications

 The X.25 software supports terminal communications according to CCITT
 recommendations X.3, X.28, and X.29 for Outgoing and Incoming termi-
 nal traffic

 X.25 native users may make outgoing calls to other Digital or non-Digital
 CPUs, or suitable network PADs accessible through a PSDN, using the
 X.29 programming interface or by using the host-based Packet Assem-
 bly/Disassembly (PAD). The PAD facility accepts DCL-style commands or
 CCITT X.28 commands.

 The X.29 Interactive Terminal Interface allows remote asynchronous ter-
 minals (character-mode DTEs) connected to the network to communicate
 with the X.25 host in a manner similar to local terminals. Dissimi-
 larities may appear as a result of delays caused by the PSDN(s) and
 the various PAD parameter settings chosen by the user or peculiar to


                                  7

 

 the PSDN(s). In this case, the remote PAD must perform code conver-
 sions between ASCII and the code the terminal uses. Note that there
 may be some restrictions imposed by the PSDN(s).

 Terminal parameters defined in the X.3 recommendation are explicitly
 supported. Network-specific enhancements or extensions to the X.3 pa-
 rameters are available at both the X.29 programming interface and the
 host-based PAD user interface. Terminal processes that depend on these
 extensions may cause problems when used on other PSDNs or when access-
 ing one PSDN via another (for example, international access).

 The X.29 terminal interface is compatible with the local terminal in-
 terface, except for those facilities where the PSDN does not provide
 adequate support. The X.29 interface includes support for specific X.29
 signaling.

 The host-based PAD employs a DCL-style command syntax, offering the
 ability to reference the CCITT PAD parameters symbolically, as well
 as an interface that conforms to the standard CCITT command signals.
 The host-based PAD also offers the capability of running multiple X.29
 sessions using the OpenVMS SPAWN and ATTACH commands. The host-based
 PAD supports reception of reselection messages to allow X.29 calls to
 be redirected to another DTE.

 The X.29 programming interface is similar to the X.25 one and allows
 an OpenVMS process to control the virtual circuit (for example, to mod-
 ify PAD parameters or clear a call). The X.29 programming interface
 can also be used to make an outgoing call to a remote PAD. The pro-
 gramming interface allows generation of PAD reselection messages.

 The maximum number of terminals supported (both local and remote X.29)
 must not exceed the number supported by OpenVMS. The use of PVCs for
 X.29 connections is not defined by the 1980, 1984 and 1988 CCITT Rec-
 ommendations and is not supported.

 Static X.25 Circuits

 X.25 allows the use of DECnet/OSI facilities over static X.25 circuits.
 These circuits are called Statically Assigned circuits.

                                  8

 

 Virtual Circuits

 X.25 Native software supports both Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVCs)
 and Switched Virtual Circuits (SVCs). One virtual circuit is used for
 each:

 o  Incoming or outgoing X.29 terminal connection

 o  X.25 connection, using either a SVC or PVC

 X.25 native supports a maximum of 4,096 virtual circuits per system.

 X.25 Access supports a maximum of 900 virtual circuits per system.

 Note that each virtual circuit requires a certain amount of memory so
 the number of logical virtual circuits possible on any single system
 will be limited by the available memory.

 Configuration

 The X.25 software includes a configuration procedure to configure a
 VAX system. This menu-based interface allows network managers to cre-
 ate an initialization script to configure entities and their attributes
 after initial installation.

 X.25 Accounting

 The X.25 Accounting utility enables the system manager to obtain in-
 formation PSDN usage. X.25 Accounting can extract the information col-
 lected and display the information directly on a terminal or write the
 information to a file. Information can be extracted for selected records,
 or a summary can be produced. The X.25 Accounting utility is compat-
 ible with the OpenVMS Accounting utility.

 In the case of incoming X.29 calls, no information about the process
 /account on to which a user is logged can be stored. However this in-
 formation may be obtained by correlation with OpenVMS accounting records.

 X.25 Security

                                  9

 

 X.25 Security allows control of both remote DTE access to the X.25 soft-
 ware, and access to the PSDN(s) by OpenVMS processes. X.25 Security
 allows for access control on the basis of:

 o  The remote DTE numbers involved, either on the basis of individ-
    ual DTE numbers or groups of DTE numbers with common leading dig-
    its.

 o  The process making the outgoing call or the application handling
    the incoming call.

 X.25 Mail

 The X.25 Mail utility allows communications via electronic mail be-
 tween two OpenVMS systems running the X.25 software in native or in
 access mode. using the OpenVMS Mail facility even in the absence of
 any DECnet/OSI communications between the two DTEs. Refer to the Open-
 VMS Operating System SPD 25.01.xx for more information about OpenVMS
 Mail.

 Synchronous Communications Devices

 The X.25 native software supports the synchronous communications de-
 vices listed in Table 2. The devices are different in many respects,
 particularly in the amount of CPU used. For optimum performance, the
 use of a DMA device is recommended.

 Line Interfaces

 The electrical line interface used for PSDN communications depends on
 the hardware device used. X.25 native provides only the electrical in-
 terface of a DTE rather than a DCE, and does not provide clock sig-
 nals. An external clock source (for example, a modem) is therefore re-
 quired.

 The range of supported synchronous communications devices covers V.24,
 V.35 and V.10, RS232, RS422 and RS423 interfaces over point-to-point,
 4-wire, synchronous, full-duplex lines at transmission rates up to 256K
 bits per second.

 Prerequisite Support

                                 10

 

 For new PSDNs, the customer and Digital must jointly prepare a Net-
 work Profile and Customer Support Plan covering all the intended net-
 work systems, their usage of SVCs, PVCs, and other network facilities,
 and their support. Without this Network Profile and Customer Support
 Plan, Digital cannot support the network connections.

 Optional Facility Support

 Support for any given CCITT X.25 facility depends on support for it
 in the appropriate supported PSDN. Generally, the X.25 software is de-
 signed to disallow use of facilities that the PSDN will not support.
 Table 1 shows what X.25 is capable doing, rather than what it will do
 when used on any particular PSDN. The product documentation describes
 specific facility availability for the supported public PSDNs.

 Notes:

 1. This is not applicable to a DTE. The X.25 software does not sup-
    port receiving a level 3 Reject packet and will not generate one.

 2. The individual DTEs must be assigned their own addresses indepen-
    dent of the hunt group address. X.25 can then ignore the hunt group.
    Alternatively, each line on the same CPU can be configured as if
    connected to a separate PSDN; each with the same DTE address.

 3. The X.25 software does not generate these statistics, however, in-
    coming statistics supplied by the PSDN are available in the account-
    ing records and at the programming interface.

 The X.25 software does not support the following items of the CCITT
 X.25 recommendation:

 o  Multi-link protocol

                                 14

 

 o  Use of the D-bit in outgoing packets

 Wide Area Network (WAN) Device Drivers

 The WAN Device Drivers included in DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS VAX support
 synchronous communications. The device drivers all offer a supported
 user ($QIO) interface.

 The Device Drivers all support full-duplex and half-duplex operation,
 where appropriate to the protocol. DDCMP and SDLC Device drivers all
 support both point-to-point and Multipoint tributary operation. `BISYNC'
 refers to the IBM[R] implementation of bisynchronous protocol. The GEN-
 BYTE protocol is a general byte-oriented protocol for use with user-
 written framing routines on some of the device drivers.

 The maximum permitted line speed depends on the line interface stan-
 dard used and must not exceed 19.2Kbps for an RS232 /V.24 standard in-
 terface. There may be additional line speed restrictions for other line
 interface standards. Refer to the Software Product Descriptions for
 the synchronous interfaces for more information. The Digital commu-
 nications layered products may not necessarily support operation of
 the synchronous interface at the maximum speed supported by the de-
 vice driver. Refer to the appropriate Software Product Description for
 the Digital communications layered product for precise details of sup-
 ported configurations.

 In all cases, the data throughput over the synchronous lines is de-
 pendent on the user applications and system environment.

 The device drivers all support modem control signal operation. Please
 refer to the product descriptions for the appropriate synchronous in-
 terface for details of the modem signals supported by an individual
 device.

 Supported controllers are listed in Table 2.

 WAN Device Drivers include a pseudo driver (WANDRIVER) that provides
 a programming interface to the data link level for the LAPB, DEC-HDLC
 and DDCMP protocols.

 Network Layer

 DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS supports both the Connectionless mode Network
 Service (CLNS) and the Connection mode Network Service (CONS). DEC-
 net/OSI supports end system routing only.

 Exchange of routing information between end systems and routers uses
 the ISO 9542 ES-IS routing protocol. This allows DECnet/OSI systems
 to autoconfigure as end systems with ISO 9542-conformant routers.

 Addresses conform to the ISO 8348 Addendum 2 specification allowing
 the support of large network topologies. As long as the system address
 stays within the addressing range of Phase IV systems (up to 1,023 sys-
 tems per area and up to 63 areas per network), and uses the same Ini-
 tial Domain Part (IDP), Phase IV or Phase V routers may be used.

 The network layer supports the capability of an end system to be mul-
 ticircuited and multihomed. Multicircuit support allows multiple cir-
 cuits to be active simultaneously. This increases network reliabil-
 ity and data throughput. Multihomed end system support allows a sys-
 tem to have up to three Network Entity Titles.

 Segregated Routing Mode is a settable attribute. It will direct rout-
 ing to choose a Phase IV router for those packets having a destina-
 tion address that can be translated to the Phase IV format. All other
 packets will be sent to a Phase V router, if available.

 The routing layer is able to cache information about the paths that
 are used to reach remote nodes.

 Transport Layer

 DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS provides support for:

 o  OSI Transport protocol as specified in ISO 8073

 o  RFC 1006 and 1006 Extensions (Internet Draft) to allow DECnet and
    OSI applications to run over TCP/IP


                                 16

 

 o  Network Services Protocol (NSP)

 NSP, RFC 1006 and OSI transports support communications between DEC-
 net, TCP/IP and OSI systems. NSP provides backwards compatibility with
 Phase IV DECnet systems.

 RFC 1006 Extensions support for DECnet applications is provided via
 a kernel interface that has been implemented on all TCP/IP stacks avail-
 able for use on OpenVMS. The supported applications include all li-
 censed DECnet applications as well as layered products, and user-written
 applications that conform to the documented DECnet programming inter-
 faces.

 The IETF RFC1006 is a specification for running OSI applications over
 TCP/IP. Operation of the FTAM and Virtual Terminal applications over
 a TCP/IP network is supported along with other layered OSI applica-
 tions such as X.400 and X.500.

 A separate TCP/IP stack is required on the same system with DECnet/OSI.
 See the OPTIONAL SOFTWARE section of this SPD for information on sup-
 ported TCP/IP products.

 OSI Transport supports Transport Classes 0, 2, and 4 on Connection Ori-
 ented networks and Class 4 on Connectionless networks.

 OSI Transport uses two types of network service:

 o  The Connectionless-mode Network Service (CLNS) using the Internet
    protocol (ISO 8473) and ES-IS protocol (ISO 9542) to communicate
    across linked subnetworks. The inactive subset of ISO 8473 (null
    internet) is also supported for communications over a single ISO
    8802-3 local area network.

 o  The Connection Oriented Network Service (CONS).






                                 17

 

 Upper Layers

 DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS software provides the OSI upper layer stack con-
 sisting of Session, Presentation and Application layers. The Appli-
 cation layer provides Association Control Service Element (ACSE), File
 Transfer, Management and Access (FTAM), and Virtual Terminal (VT).

 DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS also provides a range of DECnet applications
 and services including file and record access, remote terminal access,
 mail, and phone.

 Applications

 Transport Options for Applications

 Applications written to the DECnet upper layers can now be run over
 NSP, OSI or TCP/IP transports via RFC 1006. This includes the network
 applications that are licensed with DECnet/OSI as well as user writ-
 ten applications that adhere to the documented DECnet programming in-
 terfaces. The use of TCP/IP transports via RFC 1006 does not require
 any modification to the existing application.

 Applications written to the OSI upper layers can now be run over OSI
 or TCP/IP transports.

 Remote File Transfer

 DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS supports two upper layer protocols for remote
 file transfer: the OSI Protocol File Transfer, Access and Management
 (FTAM), and the DECnet Data Access Protocol (DAP).

 FTAM

 FTAM supports file transfer, access and management between a DECnet
 /OSI for OpenVMS system and other systems with software adhering to
 ISO 8571. In addition, FTAM is conformant with NIST Phase II and Phase
 III agreements and is certified as being conformant to the released
 specifications of US GOSIP, UK GOSIP and ENV41204.


                                 18

 

 In addition, FTAM:

 o  provides users the ability to create, delete, rename, view, and copy
    files using DCL commands.

 o  is implemented as an Application Service Element (ASE) of the OSI
    Application layer.

 o  acts as the initiator or as the responder in a connection.

 o  accesses and transfers files with both binary and character data.
    FTAM-1, FTAM-2, FTAM-3, and NBS-9 document types are supported.

 DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS also supports gateway services between FTAM and
 DAP.

 A full description of the FTAM services in DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS is
 provided in Appendix A of this document.

 DAP

 The DECnet Data Access Protocol supports task-to-task communications,
 file and record access, and proxy access.

 Task-to-Task Communications - For most applications, task-to-task com-
 munications can be programmed in a transparent manner where the re-
 mote task is treated as a full-duplex, record-oriented device. Trans-
 parent operation is provided with the following interfaces: System Ser-
 vice calls, RMS calls (OPEN, GET, PUT, and CLOSE) and high-level lan-
 guage I/O statements (which are mapped to RMS calls). A nontranspar-
 ent mode of task-to-task communications is offered by means of the Sys-
 tem Service interface that extends the capabilities provided by the
 transparent mode. These capabilities include support for interrupt mes-
 sages and multiple inbound connect requests.

 Using DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS an OpenVMS program written in a native
 mode programming language can exchange messages with other user pro-
 grams.

 OSI Application Programming Interfaces

                                 19

 

 The OSI Application Programming Interfaces enable users to write dis-
 tributed applications that communicate over open networks and use the
 OSI services provided by DECnet/OSI.

 The Interfaces are provided under the Extended Function License and
 include:

 o  an interface to FTAM (File Transfer, Access and Management)

 o  interfaces to the ACSE (Association Control Service Element) and
    Presentation layers

 o  an interface to ROSE (Remote Operations Service Element)

 o  an interface to the OSI Session Layer

 and permits the application writers to use the services of the OSI up-
 per layers in their applications.

 The APIs allow for the development of applications on DECnet/OSI sys-
 tems. Source code must be compiled and linked with the APIs. The APIs
 are required on the development system and the compile/link system.
 The resulting application can be run on any DECnet/OSI system with the
 appropriate Operating System. The APIs are not required on these tar-
 get systems. See Appendix C for details on the OSI APIs.

 File Access: File access is supported to and from remote DECnet/OSI
 for OpenVMS systems transparent to native mode high-level language pro-
 grams using RMS. User programs can sequentially read, create, and delete
 files on a remote node.

 Record Access: User programs can perform record level operations such
 as GET, PUT, UPDATE, DELETE, FIND, and REWIND to access and modify files
 residing on a remote OpenVMS node. In addition to sequential access
 to a file, several other access methods are supported through RMS us-
 ing DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS. These methods include random access by rel-
 ative record number, random access by key value, random access by Record
 File Address (RFA), and block I/O access by virtual block number.


                                 20

 

 Proxy Access: Remote users can have access to up to 15 proxy accounts
 on a specific remote system. One proxy account should be designated
 as the default proxy account on the remote system.

 Command Language File Management: Most OpenVMS Digital Command Lan-
 guage (DCL) commands can be used to perform remote file operations.
 These commands include: ANALYZE, APPEND, BACKUP, CLOSE, CONVERT, COPY,
 CREATE, DELETE, DIFFERENCES, DIRECTORY, DUMP, OPEN, PRINT, PURGE, READ,
 SEARCH, SUBMIT, TYPE, and WRITE. The operation of these commands is
 transparent except for commands that invoke processing on a specific
 system (for example, SUBMIT/REMOTE and PRINT/REMOTE). Only a node name
 added to a file specification is required to invoke the network ca-
 pabilities via one of these commands.

 Using the COPY command, a user can transfer sequential, relative, and
 indexed-sequential (ISAM) files between DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS nodes
 that support compatible file structures and record formats. Sequen-
 tial or relative files with fixed length, variable length, or vari-
 able length with fixed control field records can be transferred be-
 tween two DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS systems. Similarly, multikeyed in-
 dexed files with variable or fixed length records are supported.

 The SUBMIT/REMOTE command allows command files residing on a remote
 node to be submitted for execution at the remote node. The command file
 must be in the format expected by the node responsible for execution.
 DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS allows OpenVMS command files to be received from
 other systems and executed.

 The DCL command, EXCHANGE/NETWORK, allows the transfer of files to or
 from heterogeneous systems. This command gives users the option to trans-
 fer file types between MS-DOS[R] or ULTRIX systems and OpenVMS sys-
 tems regardless of record semantics. Unlike the COPY command, which
 preserves file and record organization during a file transfer, this
 command enables the user to modify file and record attributes during
 file transfer.

 Network Virtual Terminal



                                 21

 

 DECnet/OSI supports two upper layer protocols for terminal access: the
 OSI Virtual Terminal protocol and the DECnet Command Terminal proto-
 col.

 VT

 Virtual Terminal (VT) supports the ISO Virtual Terminal Protocol (ISO
 9041). This protocol allows remote logins and access to remote appli-
 cations between DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS systems and any remote system,
 including multivendor systems, that also run an ISO-compliant Virtual
 Terminal implementation.

 Virtual Terminal is implemented as an Application Service Element (ASE)
 of the OSI Application layer.

 Virtual Terminal may act as the terminal/initiator (for a local user)
 or as the host/responder (for the remote user).

 A full description of Virtual Terminal features is provided in Appendix
 B of this SPD.

 SET HOST

 The DCL command SET HOST allows a terminal user on one DECnet/OSI for
 OpenVMS node to establish a logical connection to another DECnet/OSI
 node that uses the Command Terminal Protocol (CTERM). This connection
 makes the terminal appear to be physically connected to the remote sys-
 tem and the operator can use all the standard system and network util-
 ities supported by that remote node. This capability is particularly
 useful for doing remote program development and allows the terminal
 users on smaller application-oriented systems to use the resources of
 larger development-oriented systems.

 Other interfaces are standard parts of DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS. Users
 can develop programs and procedures based upon these interfaces for
 such functions as file access and task-to-task communications on in-
 dividual systems. Since the DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS interfaces stay the
 same, the programs and procedures developed on an individual system
 can be used in a network environment without being modified.

                                 22

 

 Services

 Downline Loading

 DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS allows for the loading of an unattended sys-
 tem using the services provided by the Maintenance Operations Module
 (MOM). MOM provides a set of maintenance operations over various types
 of circuits by using the Maintenance Operations Protocol (MOP). A load-
 able system is a system that has a load device enabled for MOP ser-
 vice functions and for which a properly formatted load file is sup-
 plied. Downline loading involves transferring a copy of the load file
 image to a remote target node. Load requests can come from the local
 DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS operator or from the target node. Downline load-
 ing is supported for Digital server products. However, this facility
 is not supported over asynchronous DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS VAX connec-
 tions.

 Downline Task Loading

 Initial task images for loadable systems can be stored on OpenVMS file
 system devices and loaded into remote nodes. Programs already execut-
 ing on loadable systems can be checkpointed to the host OpenVMS file
 system and later restored to main memory in the node. These features
 simplify the operation of network systems that do not have mass stor-
 age devices.

 Downline Task Loading is not supported over asynchronous DECnet/OSI
 for OpenVMS VAX connections.

 Upline Dumping

 Memory images of adjacent nodes connected by DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS
 can be written or dumped into a file on an OpenVMS system. This fa-
 cility provides assistance in troubleshooting in the event of a sys-
 tem crash. This facility is also supported for Digital server prod-
 ucts.

 This facility is not supported over asynchronous DECnet/OSI for Open-
 VMS VAX connections.

 Mail

                                 23

 

 OpenVMS MAIL utility allows transmission of text messages between users
 on systems supporting MAIL-11. The DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS software al-
 lows users to exchange mail with users of other DECnet/OSI systems.

 PHONE

 The OpenVMS PHONE utility allows users to send and receive data in-
 teractively from one user's terminal to another user's terminal. DEC-
 net/OSI allows users on different systems in the same DECnet/OSI net-
 work to exchange information.

 VMScluster Alias

 DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS supports the ability to access nodes in a VM-
 Scluster using a separate alias node address, while retaining the abil-
 ity to address each node in the cluster individually. Not all network
 objects may be accessed using this mechanism. The maximum number of
 nodes supported for for a cluster alias is 94. Refer to the VMSclus-
 ter Software Product Description (SPD 29.78.xx) for relevant restric-
 tions.

 DECnet/OSI no longer requires a cluster member to be configured as a
 router. Clusters in a DECnet/OSI environment do require a reachable
 IS-IS compliant router on the LAN.

 Network Management

 Network Management is provided with the Network Control Language (NCL).
 Network management implements the DECnet/OSI layered model, based on
 the Digital hierarchical structure called Enterprise Management Ar-
 chitecture (EMA).

 NCL can be accessed through either a command line interface or a Graph-
 ical User Interface (GUI). The GUI allows network managers to view the
 status of network components and control those components from a mo-
 tif based window interface.




                                 24

 

 The DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS network management software allows:

 o  system or network managers to control and monitor the operation of
    a network and provide information related to network traffic and
    performance;

 o  network operating parameters to be configured;

 o  the manager to startup and shutdown network components as needed;

 o  network problems to be detected, isolated, and returned to service
    once repaired.

 In addition, network management can provide information warning net-
 work managers of faulty or failing network components, both hardware
 and software.

 Network Command Language (NCL) is provided as a utility to the net-
 work manager to perform the operations described above.

 NCL can also be used to test specific components of the network. NCL
 enables transmission and reception of test messages either between sys-
 tems or through controller loopback arrangements. The messages can then
 be compared for possible errors. NCL aids in isolating network prob-
 lems.

 DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS provides network event logging to a terminal
 device, disk file, or remote system. NCL can be used to enable and dis-
 able the event logging facility as well as to optionally filter spe-
 cific events.

 NCL uses the DNA Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP) which
 permits entity management from a single location anywhere in the DEC-
 net/OSI network.

 The Common Trace Facility (CTF) allows the network manager to collect
 and display information about specific protocol exchanges between sys-
 tems.


                                 25

 

 DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS supports an ISO CMISE Application Programming
 Interface (API) conforming to the Service Definitions in ISO 9595. The
 API allows for development of applications that can communicate with
 other management applications conforming to ISO 9595 on remote nodes
 in the network.

 DECnet/OSI supports the DECnet Phase IV NCP for remote management of
 Phase IV DECnet systems.

 Name Service Options

 DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS allows the use of one or more naming services.
 The available services are DECdns, DNS/bind and a new local namespace.
 Node name and addressing information is stored in the native name ser-
 vice; TCP/IP information is maintained in DNS/bind and DECnet and OSI
 information is maintained in DECdns or the local namespace.

 When more than one name service is being used, a configurable search
 list defines the order in which the existing services are to be ac-
 cessed.

 Local Namespace

 The Local Namespace replaces the Local Name Option. Using the Local
 Namespace, up to 100,000 nodes can be defined in a local naming database.
 A migration tool is available to move Phase IV and/or LNO databases
 to the new Large Local File format and/or DECdns format.

 DNS/bind

 DECnet can now retrieve TCP/IP naming and addressing information from
 the DNS/bind name service.

 DECdns

 DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS provides a global naming service with the Dig-
 ital Distributed Naming Service (DECdns).



                                 26

 

 The full DECdns service provides a consistent, network-wide set of names
 for network resources called the namespace. This namespace is main-
 tained by one or more DECdns server systems. It is recommended that
 DECdns servers should be installed on at least two systems in every
 LAN. This should provide an adequate service and redundancy.

 The features provided by DECdns include:

 o  A network-wide name-to-attribute mapping service which allows se-
    lected Digital applications to create, read, modify, and delete names
    in the namespace

 o  A hierarchical structure permitting a large number of names to be
    stored and distributed across the network

 o  Access control to each name in the namespace

 o  Management and event logging

 Distributed Time Service

 DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS provides a network time service with DECdts,
 the Digital Distributed Time Service. DECdts provides precise, fault-
 tolerant clock synchronization for systems in a LAN or WAN. Time is
 provided in coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and may be used across
 a global network. Several forms of time provider are supported, and
 a callable interface for applications allows users to add their own
 time providers. DECdts may be used by distributed applications to de-
 termine event sequencing, duration, and scheduling.

 DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS Operation

 DECnet/OSI is implemented under OpenVMS as an Ancillary Control Pro-
 cess (ACP) and a network device driver with Digital-supplied executive-
 level components and user-level programs.

 The normal OpenVMS protection has been incorporated in the operation
 of DECnet/OSI. For example, incoming connects, including file access
 and file transfer requests, are protected by the normal OpenVMS Lo-
 gin and file protection mechanisms. Outgoing connects, including file

                                 27

 

 access and file transfer requests, can include user password infor-
 mation that is implicitly specified via NCL, or explicitly specified
 by the user for verification on the remote node.

 DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS Configuration and Performance

 DECnet/OSI can be configured using either the BASIC or ADVANCED con-
 figuration options. The BASIC option is the default. It uses exist-
 ing system defaults and requires minimal information from the system
 manager. The ADVANCED option should be used where specific customiza-
 tion is required.

 With Version 6.3, cluster nodes are configurable from any node within
 the cluster.

 As with any network protocol, the performance of a given DECnet/OSI
 for OpenVMS node is a function not only of the expected network traf-
 fic and resultant processing, but also of the amount of concurrent pro-
 cessing specific to that node. Thus, node performance depends on many
 factors including:

 o  CPU type

 o  Number and type of devices attached to the particular CPU

 o  Number of device interrupts per unit time

 o  Communications line(s) characteristics

 o  Number and size of buffers

 o  Message size and frequency of transmission

 o  Applications in use

 It is important to note that the rate at which user data can be trans-
 mitted (throughput) over a communications line can sometimes approach,
 but will never exceed, the actual line speed. The reason is that the
 actual throughput is a function of many factors, including the line
 quality, protocol overhead, topology, and network application(s), as
 well as the factors cited in this section.

                                 28

 

 The performance of DECnet/OSI is comparable to the performance of DEC-
 net Phase IV.

 able as a separate order.

 INSTALLATION

 DECnet/OSI software is customer installable. Installation services are
 available for customers who desire installation of the software prod-
 uct by an experienced Digital Software Specialist.

 Digital requires that a customer's first use of X.25 include Digital
 Installation Services. These services provide for installation of the
 software product by an experienced Digital Software Specialist.

 Customer Responsibilities

 Before Digital Services can install the software, the customer must:

 o  Ensure that the system meets the minimum hardware and software re-
    quirements (as specified in the relevant SPDs);

 o  Prior to installing Digital hardware or software, obtain, install,
    and demonstrate as operational any modems and other necessary cus-
    tomer equipment or facilities to which Digital's communications hard-
    ware or software will connect;

                                 30

 

 o  Designate one adjacent node to verify installation/connectivity;

 o  Make available for a reasonable period of time, as mutually agreed
    upon by Digital and the customer, all hardware communications fa-
    cilities and terminals that are to be used during installation.

 Delays caused by any failure to meet these responsibilities will be
 charged at the then prevailing rate for time and materials.

 Installation of DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS consists of the following tasks:

 o  Verify all components of DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS have been received.

 o  Verify the necessary versions of the OpenVMS software and documen-
    tation are available.

 o  Verify the appropriate SYSGEN parameters.
    Note: Should a software specialist be required to modify the pre-
    viously installed operating system parameters, a time and materi-
    als charge will apply.

 o  Create any necessary DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS accounts and directo-
    ries.

 o  Enable software via License Product Authorization Key (PAK) reg-
    istration.

 o  Install the DECnet/OSI software on the target system using the POLY-
    CENTER Software Installation utility (PCSI).

 o  Verify the proper installation of DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS by run-
    ning a series of tests to show connectivity to a designated node.

 Connectivity to all other nodes within the network is the responsi-
 bility of the customer. Digital recommends the use of NCL to help ver-
 ify connectivity.

 In some cases the PSDN supplier (or PTT) may impose restrictions, lim-
 itations, or requirements on the proposed Digital network configura-
 tion. The customer must ensure they understand and adhere to these con-
 trols for each and every network.

                                 31

 

 For installation of the X.25 software, the customer must:

 o  Demonstrate equivalence of operation for modems other than Bell 208A,
    208B, 209, 212A synchronous modems, or in Europe, PTT approved modems.

 o  Subscribe to the Open User Group and to at least two SVCs to com-
    plete the product's installation checkout (this tests loops infor-
    mation from the X.25 native system to the PSDN and back to X.25 na-
    tive system). Systems that use PVCs or Closed User Groups only, or
    where the PSDN does not support calls to the same DTE address, re-
    quire specially negotiated arrangements for Digital installation
    of the product.

 Processors Not Supported:

 MicroVAX I, VAXstation I, VAX-11/725, VAX-11/782, VAXstation 8000

 Processor Restrictions:

 A TK50 Tape Drive is required for standalone MicroVAX 2000 and VAXs-
 tation 2000 systems.

 The RL02/R80 configuration of the VAX-11/730 is required.

 Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1)

 For OpenVMS VAX Systems:

 Disk space required for installation of Base Software: 47,600 blocks

 Disk space required for installation of All Optional Software: 81,300
 blocks

 For WAN Device Drivers:

                                 34

 

 Disk space required for installation: 5,000 blocks (2.5 MB)

 The disk space required for use (permanent) depends on the number and
 type of drivers installed, but should not exceed the space required
 for installation.

 For X.25 Software:

 Disk space required for installation: 8,000 Blocks (4 MB)

 Disk space required for use (permanent): 10,000 Blocks (5 MB)

 These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
 sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
 system environment, configuration, and software options.

 Cluster Environment

 The WAN Device Drivers are fully supported when installed on any valid
 and licensed VMScluster configuration. A device driver may only be ac-
 cessed from the system, or node, containing the communications device.

 On common disks, in order to configure some product-specific attributes
 that must remain unique to each system, certain components of the prod-
 uct are stored in the system-specific environment (SYS$SPECIFIC: [SYSxxx])
 of the VAX computer on which the installation is being performed. The
 remaining components of the product, including some or all of the ex-
 ecutable images, will be installed common to all accessing VAX sys-
 tems.

 Though some or all of the product's executable images will exist in
 the common system directory (SYS$COMMON:[SYS$LDR]) and be executable
 by all VAX computers sharing this directory, it is essential that the
 product be installed separately on all VMScluster or Local Area VM-
 Scluster licensed VAX systems requiring access in order to uniquely
 configure the product for each.

 The same version of WAN Device Drivers must be used on all systems in
 VMScluster systems accessing a common disk and in Local Area VMSclus-
 ter configurations.

                                 35

 Refer to Table 3 for detail of line speeds for supported protocols.

 o  The DSH32 (dual sync line) and the DST32 (single sync line) are mul-
    tifunction devices for Busless systems. The communications controllers
    support DMA transfers for bit oriented protocols and perform char-
    acter transmission, reception and framing in microcode.

 o  The DSW21 and DSW41 (single line) and the DSW42 (dual line) are high
    performance synchronous communications controllers for busless MicroVAX
    3100 and VAXstation 4000 systems. The communications controllers
    support DMA transfers for bit and character oriented protocols. The
    communications controller performs character transmission, recep-
    tion, and framing in microcode.

 o  The DPV11-DA or the DPV11-S (Q-bus) and DUP11 (UNIBUS) are char-
    acter interrupt devices for Datalink handling. CPU cycles are re-
    quired for Datalink level protocol processing and for each char-
    acter sent and received.

                                 36

 

 o  The DSV11 is a dual line synchronous communications device for all
    Q-bus systems. The DSV11 supports DMA transfers for bit and char-
    acter oriented protocols. The communications controller performs
    character transmission, reception and framing in microcode.

 o  The DSF32 (MI-bus) is a multifunction device for VAXft fault tol-
    erant systems. The DSF32 provides a dual line synchronous capabil-
    ity and supports DMA transfers for bit and character oriented pro-
    tocols. The communications controller performs character transmis-
    sion, reception, and framing in microcode. The two line can be used
    independently to run different protocols or can be used to provide
    a failover capability between lines in the event of an application
    or system failure.

 o  The DMB32 (BI-bus) and the DMF32 (UNIBUS) are multifunction devices
    which include a single DMA line. The communications controllers per-
    form character transmission, reception and framing in microcode.

 o  The DSB32 (BI-bus) is a dual line synchronous communications de-
    vice for VAXBI systems. The DSB32 supports DMA transfers for bit
    and character oriented protocols. The communications controller per-
    forms character transmission, reception and framing in microcode.

 Notes:

 o  The DSH32 and DST32 are not supported on VAXstation 2000 and VAXs-
    tation 3100 systems.

 o  The DSB32 is not supported for use on the VAX 7000 or VAX 10000 sys-
    tems.

 o  The DSB32 is not supported for use on a VAX 6600 with Extended Ad-
    dressing (>512MB of physical memory) enabled.

 o  The DMB32, DMF32 and DSH32 are multifunction devices. Only the de-
    vice driver for the synchronous ports are included in the DECnet
    /OSI kit.

 o  The DMB32 must be revision J or later for applications using GEN-
    BYTE, HDLC or SDLC protocols.

                                 37

 

 o  The DMF32 must be revision J of later for applications using HDLC
    protocol and rev. M is required for simultaneous operation of the
    printer port.

 o  The DMB32 only supports a synchronous line speed of 19.2Kbps if any
    asynchronous lines are in use. The DMB32 is also supported on VAX
    7000 and 10000 systems configured with Extended Addressing, (32bit
    physical addresses).

 o  The DMF32 is supported on a VAXBI system fitted with a DWBUA UNIBUS
    adapter for DDCMP and GENBYTE protocol use only.

 o  The DSH32 running the DDCMP protocol only supports a single line
    at 9.6Kbps on a MicroVAX 2000. Running the BISYNC protocol it only
    supports a single line at 4.8Kbps on a MicroVAX 2000.

 o  The DSV11, DSW42, and the DSB32 support the use of different pro-
    tocols on each of the two lines of the device.

 o  The DUP11 is supported on a VAXBI system fitted with a DWBUA UNIBUS
    adapter for VAX 8200, VAX 8250, VAX 8300, VAX 8300, VAX 8350, VAX
    8500, VAX 8530, VAX 8550, VAX 8700, and VAX 8800 systems only.

 All the WAN Device Drivers included with DECnet/OSI offer support for
 a user ($QIO) interface. Table 3 lists the device driver character-
 istics and indicates the maximum permitted line speeds in kilobits/second
 for each of the line protocol supported by the individual drivers.

 Note: Where two line speeds are shown, for example 256/64, the higher
 speed refers to single line operation of the device while the lower
 speed refers to dual line operation of the device.

 The WAN Device Drivers included with DECnet/OSI also provide a pseudo
 driver (WANDRIVER) that provides a programming interface to the data
 link level for the LAPB, DEC-HDLC, and DDCMP protocols.

 The device drivers all support full-duplex and half-duplex operation,
 where appropriate to the protocol. DDCMP and SDLC device drivers all
 support both point-to-point and Multipoint tributary operation. "BISYNC"
 refers to the IBM implementation of bisynchronous protocol. The GEN-
 BYTE protocol is a general byte-oriented protocol for use with user-
 written framing routines, is supported by the DMB32 and the DMF32 de-
 vice drivers.

                                 39

 

 The maximum permitted line speed depends on the line interface stan-
 dard used and must not exceed 19.2Kbps for and RS232/V.24 interface.
 There may be additional line speed restrictions for other line inter-
 face standards, refer to the Software Product Descriptions for the syn-
 chronous interfaces for more information. Other Digital communications
 layered products may not necessarily support operation of the synchronous
 interface at the maximum line speed supported by the device driver.
 Refer to the appropriate Software Product Description for the Digi-
 tal communications layered product for precise details of supported
 configurations.

 In all cases, throughput over synchronous lines is dependent on the
 user application and system environment.

 The WAN Device Drivers all support modem control signal operation. Please
 refer to the Software Product Descriptions for the appropriate syn-
 chronous interface for details of the modem signals supported by an
 individual interface.

 Optional Hardware

 Additional communications device(s) subject to the limitations described
 in Table 3 of this SPD are required.

 Supported Public Networks

 Table 4 describes public PSDNs which are supported with the X.25 soft-
 ware only in the countries shown. In addition to these public PSDNs,
 certain private PSDNs have been tested by Digital and appropriate pro-
 files included in the X.25 software.

 Since the publication of this SPD, other configurations may have been
 tested. Please consult your local Digital office for any questions con-
 cerning other public PSDNs. Digital has designed or adopted the X.25
 software to operate with equipment conforming to ISO 8208/7776, with

 X.25 Software Configuration Guidelines

 Table 5 describes the physical hardware configurations supported by
 X.25 in terms of CPU type and communication interface. It is assumed
 that there are 128 bytes of user data per packet in an X.25 native mode
 configuration where data is being sent and received at maximum speeds
 in both directions. These tables indicate configuration numbers for
 certain VAX processors supported at the time of publication.

 The numbers given in the tables are load costs. Load costs indicate
 the overhead of full-duplex packet transfer at the indicated speed.
 The load units are calculated for an application that does no work with
 transmitted/received data, and indicate a maximum packet rate for that
 configuration. An idle device incurs negligible load. Systems should
 be configured to sustain peak load rates.

 Factors to Consider

 Other factors to consider when configuring hardware devices for use
 with X.25 on a given processor are:

 o  Hardware configuration limits, such as power supply, backplane space,
    bus throughput and mapping registers available, and any other re-
    strictions on the number of devices per CPU or per bus, must be ob-
    served.

 o  Actual/average Packet size in bytes - generally, doubling the ac-
    tual packet size will halve the load units consumed for DMA devices,
    but increase the load units for character-interrupt devices by ap-
    proximately 30 percent.

 o  The above table assumes that data is sent and received in each di-
    rection of a full-duplex line in equal ratio. If the number of X.25
    packets per second is predominantly one-way, the load units per line
    can be reduced proportionately up to a factor of 50%.

 How to Use Table 6

                                 47

 

 The maximum system configuration, with a mix of device types is com-
 puted by adding the load costs (in load units) for each device up to
 the limit for a given processor type.

 Example 1:

 A VAX 8500 is being used to process X.25 native mode communications.
 If the system uses one line of a DSB32 at 192Kbps and a DMB32 at 19.2Kbps,
 the load unit total is 156. Assuming these devices are fully active,
 they will consume 156/360 = 43% of the CPU for communications process-
 ing. It is inadvisable to add more devices to this CPU, unless it is
 dedicated to the task of communications processing.

 Example 2:

 When one line of a DSV11 is fully used on a MicroVAX 3800 at 64Kbps,
 it consumes 120/390 = 31% of the processor in processing X.25 commu-
 nications.

 Certain versions of these products depend upon a specific version of
 the operating system. Please refer to the Software Product Descrip-
 tions of the product in question to determine which version is required.

 Appendix A: File Transfer, Access and Management (FTAM)

 FTAM software provides communications for performing file operations
 between open systems. These operations are:

 o  Copying files between local and remote systems.

 o  Appending, deleting, or renaming files on open systems.

 o  Displaying information about files on open systems.

 An open system is a computer system that implements the standards for
 each of the seven layers of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Ref-
 erence Model for communications as defined by the International Or-
 ganization for Standardization. An FTAM system is any open system con-
 taining an FTAM implementation that conforms to the FTAM standard and
 includes the implementations of the necessary underlying OSI services.




                                 52

 

 FTAM implements several standards that define the following components
 of these layers of the OSI Basic Reference Model: the File Transfer,
 Access and Management (FTAM) service element and the Association Con-
 trol Service Element (ACSE) of the Application layer, the Presenta-
 tion layer, and the Session layer.

 Supported Standards

 FTAM conforms to the following OSI standards:

 o  ISO 8571 - File Transfer, Access and Management service and pro-
    tocol

 o  ISO 8650 - ACSE protocol

 o  ISO 8823 - Presentation protocol

 o  ISO 8327 - Session protocol

 The following table provides a comparison of the supported implemen-
 tation profiles for different standards bodies and their relationship
 to each other.

 FTAM Component Software

 The component software includes the user facilities (initiators), re-
 sponders, management tools, and problem determination tools.


                                 54

 

 FTAM User Facilities

 The FTAM user facilities are accessed by OpenVMS Operating System com-
 mands. These commands are APPEND, COPY, DIRECTORY, RENAME, and DELETE.
 They operate on files stored on any FTAM system whose implementations
 are compatible with FTAM. These commands cannot be used for manipu-
 lating files on your local system.

 Support for Any File Naming Convention

 A file designation is system-specific information that identifies a
 file to its storage system. FTAM software lets users specify files us-
 ing the naming conventions of the systems where the files reside. FTAM
 supports the OpenVMS Operating System RMS format for file specifica-
 tions and a comparable style of file-specification format that accom-
 modates non-RMS file designations.

 Support for Several File Types

 FTAM software can access and transfer files containing both binary and
 ASCII data. FTAM-1, FTAM-2, FTAM-3, and NBS-9 document types are sup-
 ported.

 FTAM-1 files are unstructured text files, FTAM-2 files are sequential
 text files, and FTAM-3 files are unstructured binary files. The FTAM-
 1, FTAM-2, and FTAM-3 document types support the following parameters.

 NBS-9 files are NBS file directories.

 Flexible and Transparent Access for Local Files

 FTAM software treats local files the same way that the OpenVMS Oper-
 ating System file system treats them.

 File Transfers

 The FTAM COPY command transfers files between compatible FTAM systems
 without modifying the source file. The facility can transfer files in
 either direction between the local system and a remote FTAM system.
 The COPY command can also transfer files between two remote FTAM sys-
 tems for a local FTAM user.

 This command also allows you to append one or more files to a single
 output file within or between FTAM systems.

 FTAM-DAP Gateway

 The FTAM-DAP Gateway lets you perform file operations from a non-OSI
 system which supports the DAP protocol to an OSI system supporting FTAM.
 Remote users of the gateway do not have to establish accounts on the
 gateway system to use its capabilities. The gateway does not support
 the APPEND functionality.

                                 56

 

 File Deletion

 The FTAM DELETE command can delete one or more files on any combina-
 tion of FTAM systems provided that the user has delete access to those
 files on the specific FTAM system.

 Renaming Requests

 The FTAM RENAME command allows you to rename files. The command works
 on files stored on remote FTAM systems (remote files). The command en-
 ables you to change the pathname or file name of an existing file. For
 remote files, you must specify whatever type of information the re-
 mote FTAM system requires for specifying files.

 Directory Requests

 The FTAM DIRECTORY command displays the complete set of FTAM file at-
 tributes. Specific options allow users to vary the display of attributes
 that are meaningful in an OpenVMS Operating System environment: for
 example, date/time of last modification of file name.

 FTAM File Error Recovery

 FTAM provides File Error Recovery functionality both in the COPY ini-
 tiator command and in the FTAM responder. File Error Recovery is pro-
 vided for Class 1, Class 2, and Class 3 type errors as detailed in ISO
 8571-4.

 Class 1 File Error Recovery provides only the restart functionality,
 while Classes 2 and 3 File Error Recovery provide both the Restart and
 Recovery functionality as follows:

 o  If an internal error is detected in the data transfer regime, Class
    1 recovery restarts the data transfer regime by retransmitting the
    file data beginning at the negotiated checkpoint within the data
    transfer regime;

 o  Class 2 error recovery provides for the re-establishment of the se-
    lect and open regimes, and also allows for the retransmission of
    file data beginning at a negotiated checkpoint within the data trans-
    fer regime;

                                 57

 

 o  Class 3 error recovery provides full recovery by re-establishing
    a lost FTAM association and its select and open regimes. Class 3
    recovery will then restart the data transfer regime by retransmit-
    ting the file data beginning at the negotiated checkpoint within
    the data transfer regime.

 All restart and recovery operations and procedures are completely trans-
 parent to the user.

 Management and Problem Determination Tools

 FTAM software supplies a number of management tools, including an in-
 stallation verification procedure (IVP), a tracing utility, event log-
 ging, and informational and error messages.

 FTAM Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)

 The FTAM IVP sets up outbound and inbound application associations.
 A connection is made to your local system (as a loopback test). The
 FTAM IVP checks that your installation is able to set up and release
 presentation and session connections. It tests the FTAM software by
 starting a responder and reading the attributes of a file with the DI-
 RECTORY command.

 FTAM Tracing Utility

 The FTAM tracing utility (ositrace) is a tool for identifying prob-
 lems in protocol exchanges between your local system and any remote
 FTAM system. The tracing utility captures protocol exchanges and tran-
 scribes them into easily read text. ositrace data is written to SYS$OUTPUT.

 The FTAM tracing utility monitors data exchanges for individual as-
 sociations. The tracing utility can trace data originating from the
 following components: FTAM (DATA, PROTOCOL, and STRUCTURING), ACSE,
 Presentation, and Session.

 OSI Address Lookup using X.500

 The FTAM software is capable of retrieving network addresses from the
 X.500 directory. This functionality may be used in conjunction with
 or instead of retrieving addresses from a local repository.

                                 58

 

 FTAM Event Logging

 For event logging, the FTAM responder writes records to OSIF$RESPONDER.LOG.

 Requirements for Compatibility with FTAM

 FTAM lets an open system perform a specific set of file transfer, ac-
 cess and management activities with any open system having a compat-
 ible FTAM implementation.

 The Protocol Implementation Conformance Statement (PICS) provides more
 information about Digital's FTAM implementation.

 Appendix B: Virtual Terminal

 DECnet/OSI Virtual Terminal is Digital Equipment Corporation's imple-
 mentation of the ISO Virtual Terminal Basic Class standard, which is
 comprised of the service definition (ISO 9040) and the protocol (ISO
 9041). The DECnet/OSI Virtual Terminal software adheres to these stan-
 dards, thereby providing interactive access between DECnet/OSI sys-
 tems and other multivendor terminal systems and host systems that also
 adhere to the ISO Virtual Terminal Basic Class standard.

 Virtual Terminal is implemented as an Application Service Element (ASE)
 of the OSI Application layer.

 DECnet/OSI Virtual Terminal can run over Transport Layer Classes 0,
 2 or 4 over CONS, and TP4 over CLNS. DECnet/OSI Virtual Terminal can
 also run over TCP/IP networks using RFC1006.

 Virtual Terminal provides Terminal/Initiator (for a local user) and
 Host/Responder (for the remote user) capabilities. Terminal/Responder
 and Host/Initiator are not supported.

 Supported Standards

 Virtual Terminal conforms to the following OSI standards:

 o  ISO 9041 - Virtual Terminal Protocol - Basic Class

 tion with or instead of retrieving addresses from a local repository.

                                 60

 

 Command Mode

 Command Mode allows the user to execute commands that can modify the
 characteristics of the Virtual Terminal association with the remote
 application.

 Trace Utility

 The Virtual Terminal tracing utility (ositrace) is a tool for iden-
 tifying problems in protocol exchanges between your local system and
 any remote system. The utility captures protocol exchanges and tran-
 scribes them into easily read text.

 The tracing utility monitors data exchanges for individual associa-
 tions. The utility can trace data originating from the VT, ACSE, Pre-
 sentation, and Session components.
