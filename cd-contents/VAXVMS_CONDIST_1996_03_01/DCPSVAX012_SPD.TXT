PRODUCT NAME:  DECprint Supervisor (DCPS) for OpenVMS, SPD 44.15.04
               Version 1.2

DESCRIPTION

DECprint Supervisor (DCPS) for OpenVMS is a family of layered prod-
ucts that run on OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha systems to provide ac-
cess to selected PostScript [R] Level 1 and Level 2 print devices.

The DECprint Supervisor family consists of the following products:

o  DECprint Supervisor for OpenVMS, Base (DCPS-Base)-DCPS-Base drives
   Digital PostScript printers, and supports files formatted in PostScript
   and ANSI-Compliant Digital Printing Protocol Level 3 (DEC PPL3).
   It also supports these printers' special features, such as tray se-
   lection and two sided printing, and the mailbox option for the LPS32.
   DCPS-Base also allows files formatted in Hewlett-Packard PCL[R] 5
   Printer Language (PCL 5) to be printed on Digital PostScript print-
   ers that have a native (built-in) PCL 5 interpreter. See the Other
   Hardware Required section of the SPD for specific models. The li-
   cense rights to this product are included with the OpenVMS oper-
   ating system.

o  DECprint Supervisor for OpenVMS, Open (DCPS-Open)-DCPS-Open drives
   selected third party PostScript printers, and supports files for-
   matted in PostScript and ANSI (DEC PPL3). It also supports these
   printers' special features, such as tray selection and two sided
   printing. DCPS-Open allows files formatted in PCL 5 to be printed
   on certain PostScript printers that have a native PCL 5 interpreter.
   See the Other Hardware Required section of the SPD for specific mod-
   els. The license rights for this product must be separately pur-
   chased.

                              DIGITAL                      May 1995

                                                        AE-PUM0E-TE

 

o  DECprint Supervisor for OpenVMS, Plus (DCPS-Plus)-DCPS-Plus includes
   value added features, such as number-up, layup, automatic data type
   detection, and high speed image printing, plus the full range of
   translators for the most popular printer languages. The license rights
   for this product must be separately purchased. Licenses are required
   for both DCPS-Open and DCPS-Plus for advanced printing features for
   third-party printers.

DECprint Supervisor software consists of the following components:

o  A print symbiont that processes print requests from the host on which
   it resides.

o  Communication software to transmit the request and associated data
   over the following protocols:

      Ethernet to a PrintServer printer via DECnet and TCP/IP using
      Common Printer Access Protocol (CPAP)
      AppleTalk[R] over Ethernet or LocalTalk[R]
      Local Area Terminal (LAT)
      Serial line

o  Translators to convert various non-PostScript files into the PostScript
   language for printing.

o  Page formatting capabilities such as the ability to print multi-
   ple page images on a single side of a sheet of paper, and to spec-
   ify borders, margins, and page offsets.

o  A series of PostScript tools for application developers. These in-
   clude a PostScript error handler and Font Encoding Vectors for the
   ISO Latin Alphabet Number 1 (ISO 8859/1) and Digital Multinational
   Character Set for use with all the PostScript text fonts that are
   built into Digital's PostScript printers.

DECprint Supervisor software must be installed on each node that has
print queues for PostScript printers. A DCPS-Open license must be in-
stalled on each node that has queues which connect to third-party PostScript
printers. However, systems providing printing through PATHWORKS servers
to third-party printers are licensed through PATHWORKS for OpenVMS and
do not need a separate DCPS-Open license. A DCPS-Plus license is also

                                 2

 

required for each node that has queues that take advantage of the DCPS-
Plus features, whether they connect to Digital or third-party print-
ers. To use the value added features with supported third party print-
ers, you need both the DCPS-Open and the DCPS-Plus licenses.

A system running DECprint Supervisor software can transmit print re-
quests to any Digital PrintServer printer on a DECnet or TCP/IP net-
work that is defined in its network database. In order to communicate
with a TCP/IP connected PrintServer, DEC TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS
software must be installed. PrintServer Software (SPD 49.09.xx) is re-
quired to make a PrintServer printer operational.

A system running DECprint Supervisor software can transmit print re-
quests to any supported desktop PostScript printer in the local area
network when it is equipped with a serial interface port and is con-
nected to a LAT-based terminal server.

A system running DECprint Supervisor software can transmit print re-
quests to any supported desktop PostScript printer on an AppleTalk net-
work. In order to communicate with an printer on an AppleTalk network,
the system must also run the AppleTalk for OpenVMS network software
that accompanies the PATHWORKS for OpenVMS (Macintosh) software prod-
uct (SPD 35.09.xx).

Basic Printing Features

Basic printing features are provided by DCPS-Base for Digital PostScript
printers, and by DCPS-Open for third-party PostScript printers, within
the limitations of the supported print devices. Not all basic features
are available on all supported devices.

Basic features include:

o  PostScript printing. The print symbiont passes PostScript files di-
   rectly to the printer. DECprint Supervisor does not interpret or
   translate PostScript files. Therefore, they must be created using
   standard PostScript Level 1 or Level 2 operators as defined within
   the printer itself.


                                 3

 

o  ANSI (DEC PPL3) printing. DECprint Supervisor translates ANSI files
   into PostScript for printing on the output device. These ANSI files
   may contain ASCII text, sixel graphics, and other features of Dig-
   ital's ANSI-compliant Printing Protocol Level 3.

o  Selection of input tray via INPUT_TRAY, SHEET_SIZE, or PAGE_SIZE
   parameters, and output tray via OUTPUT_TRAY, within the limitations
   of the printer and the tray-naming conventions to provide such fea-
   tures.

o  Rotation of the page via the PAGE_ORIENTATION parameter for non-
   PostScript files only.

o  Selection of single-sided, double-sided, or tumble printing when
   available on the printer, via the SIDES parameter.

o  Formatting of ANSI text files via the /HEADER, /FORM, /SPACE, and
   /FEED qualifiers and the TAB parameter.

o  Control of ANSI file margins, page setup, and wrap or truncate op-
   tions as specified by the DEFINE/FORM commands.

o  Printing ANSI files with optional fonts via the FONTS_USED param-
   eter. (The optional fonts are available as a separately orderable
   SoftFonts kit.)

o  Status and error messages sent to the user's terminal, may be printed
   on the job trailer page or job log page, written to a log file, or
   printed on the operator's console.

o  Use of device control modules for basic data types via the /SETUP
   qualifier. PostScript modules may contain any PostScript operators
   supported by the printer in the printing context.

o  Provide accounting information for each print job as follows: sheets
   of paper printed, the number of RMS Gets, and the number of QIO Writes.

o  Provide access to the PCL 5 interpreter native to selected print-
   ers. Printers for which native PCL interpreter is supported are listed
   in the Other Hardware Required section of the SPD.

o  Provides access to DCPS product features for printers with an Ap-
   pleTalk connection in a PATHWORKS environment.

                                 4

 

o  Supports PrintServer printers on DECnet or TCP/IP interconnects us-
   ing CPAP protocol (TCP/IP requires DEC TCP/IP Services for Open-
   VMS SPD 25.A4.xx for VAX systems or SPD 46.46.xx for Alpha systems).

Advanced Printing Features

Advanced printing features are provided by DCPS-Plus for either Dig-
ital or third-party PostScript printers, within the limitations of the
supported print devices. Third-party printers still require the DCPS-
Open license.

Advanced features include:

o  Automatic data type detection and switching. The software attempts
   to determine the data type of the file. If successful, it will au-
   tomatically translate, if necessary, and print the file. If it can-
   not determine the file data type, it will use the default data type
   defined by DATA_TYPE=AUTOMATIC.

   If the file is printed using the data type defined by DATA_TYPE=AUTOMATIC,
   the symbiont will look for a switch to PostScript command (%!) and
   continue to process the rest of the file as PostScript. This switch
   may occur only once per file. The switch to PostScript feature is
   not available when DCPS uses a printer's native PCL interpreter to
   process the file.

o  Printing non-PostScript data types on the PostScript printer. Trans-
   lators are provided to translate the following data types into PostScript
   for printing:

   -  DDIF (Bitonal Image subset only)

   -  PCL Level 4 (as implemented on the HP [R] LaserJet [R] IID)

   -  IBM [R] Proprinter [R] XL24

   -  ReGIS

   -  TEKTRONIX [R] 4010/4014

                                 5

 

   -  ASCII LIST translator that formats and numbers ASCII files. This
      translator numbers each line of text, creates alternating bars
      of gray and white in the background, and creates a running head
      of the file name, and page number.

o  Printing two or more page images on a single side of a sheet via
   the NUMBER_UP parameter.

o  Specifying page layup features via the LAYUP_DEFINITION parameter.
   Page layup features include Borders, Margins, Margin Alternation,
   Pages Per Sheet, First Page, Page Order, and Page Grid. Layup def-
   inition options may be provided directly, as arguments to the LAYUP_
   DEFINITION parameter, or indirectly, as the contents of a file spec-
   ified by that parameter.

o  Specifying a range of pages of the file to be printed via the PAGE_
   LIMIT parameter.

o  Automatically scaling a page created for one paper size so that it
   fits on a different paper size via use of both the PAGE_SIZE and
   SHEET_SIZE parameters on the same print command.

o  Printing multiple (uncollated) copies of each sheet via the SHEET_
   COUNT parameter.

o  Use of device control modules for all data types via the /SETUP qual-
   ifier. ANSI modules may include control sequences. PCL modules may
   include binary font data.

o  Supports image printing on PrintServer printers (for printing of
   DDIF bitonal image files) taking advantage of the fastest image print-
   ing capabilities of the printer (PostScript Level 1, PostScript Level
   2, or Image PDL).

ANSI (DEC PPL3) Emulation

Printing of ANSI text and sixel graphics is compatible with Digital's
ANSI-compliant PPL3 printers. Documents containing PPL3 font cartridge
commands will be printed if the system has the appropriate optional
SoftFonts kits installed, and the optional font modules are specified
with the FONTS_USED parameter.

                                 6

 

Note: PostScript printers differ in the amount of virtual memory they
have available for printing and font storage. Files which require down-
loading of fonts may be printed differently, may print more slowly,
or may fail to print, on some printers.

Third-Party Printing Devices

The DCPS-Open license extends to selected third-party PostScript print-
ers the support equivalent to that provided for a similar Digital printer
with the DCPS-Base license, within the capability of the third-party
printer.

The Other Hardware Required section of the SPD lists the supported third-
party printers. Digital makes no representation relative to the use
of this product to drive PostScript devices not listed in this SPD.
The use of the DCPS-Open product to drive PostScript devices not listed
on this SPD is not warranted nor supported.
