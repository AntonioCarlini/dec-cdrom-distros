           PRODUCT NAME:  IEX-VMS-DRIVER, Version 4.4             SPD 26.30.10

           DESCRIPTION

           IEX-VMS-DRIVER allows programs written in VAX MACRO and higher-level
           languages (such as VAX FORTRAN, VAX BASIC, and VAX Pascal) to commu-
           nicate through the IEU11-A or IEQ11-A with devices containing an IEC
           625-1 or IEEE Standard 488 interface. This communication is implemented
           through a choice of direct QIO calls or a set of subroutines callable
           from high-level languages.

           Note: In the following description, the term IEX11 stands for the IEU11-
           A and/or IEQ11-A interface. The IEU11-A supports VAX UNIBUS machines,
           and the IEQ11-A supports MicroVAX Q-bus machines.

           The IEX11-A interface is a bit-parallel, byte-serial device that can
           perform transfers in either program interrupt or DMA (direct memory
           access) mode. Program interrupt is used for transferring commands and
           addresses, while DMA is used for transferring data. DMA significantly
           reduces processor loading during the transfer of long data buffers.

           The IEX11-A interface contains two independent IEC/
           IEEE bus controllers, also known as General Purpose Interface Buses
           (GPIBs). These two controllers may be connected to the same or to dif-
           ferent IEC/IEEE buses. Up to 15 devices may be attached to each IEC
           /IEEE bus.

           The IEX11 is most commonly used as Controller-in-Charge, but it can
           also be used when another device is Controller-in-Charge. The Controller-
           in-Charge directs the sequence of information on the bus.

                                                                   AE-BW75M-TE

 



           IEX-VMS-DRIVER, Version 4.4                           SPD 26.30.10


           When the IEX11 acts as Controller-in-Charge, it may request status in-
           formation from other devices through serial and parallel polling. When
           the IEX11 is not Controller-in-Charge, it can be polled in either fash-
           ion to provide status information.

           Features

           The IEX-VMS-DRIVER supports the following IEC/IEEE hardware capabil-
           ities:

           o  Controller (C1, C2, C3, C4, C5)

           o  Talker and Extended Talker (T5, TE5)

           o  Listener and Extended Listener (L3, LE3)

           o  Automatic Source Handshake (SH1)

           o  Automatic Acceptor Handshake (AH1)

           o  Service Request (SR1)

           o  Remote/Local (RL1)

           o  Parallel Poll (PP1, PP2)

           o  Device Clear (DC1)

           o  Device Trigger (DT1)

           The IEX-VMS-DRIVER supports QIO requests to perform the following soft-
           ware functions:

           o  Initialize Unit

           o  Write Data

           o  Read Data

           o  Send One IEC/IEEE Bus Command*

           o  Send a String of IEC/IEEE Bus Commands*

           o  Request Service**

           o  Issue a Serial Poll*

           The event recognition facility allows the user's process to specify
           the events on the IEC/IEEE instrument bus which the interface should
           detect. The interface is capable of detecting the occurrence of the
           following events:

           o  Service Request*

           o  Addressed as Listener**

           o  Addressed as Talker**

           *  Functions that can only be used by the Controller-in-Charge

           ** Functions used only by a device that is not Controller-in-Charge

           All IEC/IEEE bus commands are issued through a process request and all
           data is transferred through the DMA mechanism. When the IEX-VMS-DRIVER
           is processing a read data request, the three ways to detect the end
           of the data transfer are:

           o  Byte Count Overflow - Transfer terminates after the specified num-
              ber of bytes have been read.

           o  EOI Termination - Transfer terminates if, during the reception of
              a byte, the EOI line is true.

           o  Match Character - Transfer terminates after the Termination spec-
              ified match character has been consecutively received the speci-
              fied number of times.

           A device exerciser is provided to verify that the IEX-VMS-DRIVER is
           correctly installed and to aid the user in testing his application.
           When the two bus controllers are connected with a loop back cable (re-
           fer to the IEU11-A/IEQ11-A User's Guide), the device exerciser can be
           run with command files delivered with the exerciser. These command files
           demonstrate all features of the driver and the IEC/IEEE bus interface
           functions. The device exerciser can also be used by users in a dia-
           logue mode to test their devices. The commands to the exerciser are
           directly converted into QIOs to the driver. Using the exerciser in the
           dialogue mode, users can quickly determine the set of QIOs required
           for their application.

           The IEX-VMS-DRIVER may be programmed in the following two ways:

           VMS QIO System Service - The VMS QIO requests allow direct access to
           the driver. These requests can be issued in higher-level languages (such
           as VAX FORTRAN, VAX BASIC, VAX Pascal, and MACRO-32). This is the most
           flexible way of programming the IEX11 device, but requires the user
           to be familiar with the QIO calling procedures.

           Simplified User Interface - This is a package of subroutines which can
           be called from higher-level languages (such as VAX FORTRAN and VAX BASIC)
           to perform the following functions:

           IESTRT -  Initialize an interface

           IEPOLL -  Setup for serial polling

           IESEND -  Send data

           IERECV -  Receive data

           IERQSV -  Request service

           IECMD  -  Perform a bus control function

           IEWFE  -  Wait for IEC/IEEE bus event

           OPTIONAL HARDWARE

           Depending on processor type, up to 3 additional IEU11/IEQ11 modules
           may be added to each system for a total of 4 maximum.

           CLUSTER ENVIRONMENT

           This layered product is fully supported when installed on any valid
           and licensed VAXcluster* configuration. It must be installed once on
           each VAX, MicroVAX, or VAXstation processor on which usage is planned.

           In order to configure some product-specific attributes that must re-
           main unique to each system, certain components of the product are stored
           in the system-specific environment (SYS$SPECIFIC:[SYSxxx]) of the VAX,
           MicroVAX, or VAXstation processor on which the installation is per-
           formed. The remaining components of the product, including some or all
           of the executable images, will be installed common to all accessing
           systems.
