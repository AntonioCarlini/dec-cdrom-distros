 PRODUCT NAME:  Hierarchical Storage Management for OpenVMS Version 2.1
 SPD 46.38.08

 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

 Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM) for OpenVMS is a layered soft-
 ware product that extends the OpenVMS file system to allow efficient
 management of infrequently accessed (dormant) data. HSM migrates dor-
 mant data from online storage to less expensive nearline or offline
 (shelf) storage. The movement of dormant data to shelf storage is called
 shelving. The shelved data can be automatically and transparently re-
 turned to online storage when needed. HSM will also save valuable backup
 time, since the shelved data is already located on secure, removable
 media.

 New features of HSM V2.1 for OpenVMS include:

 o  Support for OpenVMS Alpha V7.0 and V7.1

 o  Support for OpenVMS VAX V7.0 and V7.1

 o  Support for TL82x Multi-Tower Library

 Recent features of HSM for OpenVMS include:

 o  Tape Repacking *

 o  Backup via Shelving

 o  Multiple Catalog Support

 o  The ability to move data between archive classes

 o  Shelving performance enhancements

                                                        January 1997

                                                         AE-PWNTJ-TE

 

 o  Catalog analysis and repair support

 * See the software requirements for the Tape Repacking function in the
 Software Requirements section of this SPD.

 HSM for OpenVMS Operation

 HSM operates in Basic or Plus Mode. Basic mode uses its own media man-
 ager and supports a limited number of device types. Plus mode allows
 the use of advanced storage devices. If used for remote tape devices,
 Plus Mode requires the Remote Device Facility[TM] (RDF) software. See
 the OPTIONAL SOFTWARE section for details.

 New and frequently accessed files remain online while older and less
 active files are automatically, or manually, shelved in accordance with
 user-defined policies. The directory information and file headers for
 shelved files are maintained on online storage devices while the data
 itself is on the shelf device. When access is needed to the shelved
 data, HSM automatically returns it to online storage. The file attributes
 may be viewed and modified without bringing the data back online.

 Control over the execution of the shelving process is either explicit
 or implicit. Explicit shelving is a process that has been started in
 response to a DCL command. The command can be issued directly to the
 OpenVMS Operating System or executed in an OpenVMS command procedure.
 Implicit shelving is a process that has been started by HSM in response
 to a trigger event or policy.

 The transparent management of HSM is set through HSM policies which:

 o  Specify which files are or are not to be shelved

 o  Set a high water mark on the online storage to automatically trig-
    ger shelving of dormant data

 o  Set a low water mark as a space recovered goal when your files are
    shelved

 o  Specify which processes should cause automatic unshelving

                                  2

 

 HSM policies use predefined selection algorithms or scripts contain-
 ing HSM-specific commands to shelve or unshelve files in response to
 trigger events. Trigger events are situations that, when set by an HSM
 policy, cause HSM to move files to shelf storage. Examples of specific
 trigger events are listed below:

 o  Volume occupancy full

 o  Disk quota exceeded

 o  High water mark reached

 o  Scheduled policy execution

 Trigger events, used in conjunction with appropriately designed se-
 lection criteria, free up enough online disk space to satisfy the pol-
 icy goal.

 The selection criteria include definitions that determine the appro-
 priate files to be shelved in response to the need for shelving. Ex-
 amples of selection criteria include:

 o  Least recently used and size combination

 o  Least recently used

 o  According to a user-defined script

 HSM for OpenVMS supports file access to shelved files on client sys-
 tems where access is through DFS, NFS, or PATHWORKS.

 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

 HSM for OpenVMS runs on the VAX and Alpha processors supported by Open-
 VMS. For a detailed list of VAX processors supported by OpenVMS, see
 the OpenVMS VAX Operating System Software Product Description (SPD 25.01.xx).
 For a detailed list of Alpha processors supported by OpenVMS, see the
