 Product Name:  MAILbus Directory Migration Toolkit     SPD 61.15.00
                for OpenVMS VAX, Version 1.0

 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

 The MAILbus[TM] Directory Migration Toolkit (DMT) for OpenVMS[TM] VAX[TM]
 is a layered software product that resides on an OpenVMS VAX system.

 The MAILbus Directory Migration Toolkit (DMT) provides a set of elec-
 tronic mail software products and enhancements that will allow present
 Message Router based customers to migrate to a MAILbus 400[TM] /X.500
 solution. Specifically, the toolkit provides synchronisation of in-
 formation held on Message Router Directory Service (DDS) and Digital[TM]
 X.500 Directory System Agent (DSA). When used in conjunction with the
 MAILbus 400 Message Router Gateway (XMR), the MAILbus Directory Mi-
 gration Toolkit provides a complete migration solution.

 The MAILbus Directory Migration Toolkit accesses the Digital X.500 Di-
 rectory Service via the X/Open[TM] Company Limited's OSI-Abstract-Data
 Manipulation Application Program Interface (API) and API to Directory
 Services, also known as XDS/XOM Application Program Interface. The XDS
 /XOM API is part of the Digital X.500 DSA and is implemented by in-
 stalling the X.500 Base Kit.

 Note: The MAILbus Directory Migration Toolkit and the X.500 Base Kit
 must both be installed with VAX Message Router on the same node/Cluster.

 The toolkit comprises the following components:

 o  X.500 and DDS Directory Synchroniser (XDDS), has been developed to
    provide two way synchronisation between information held in the Mes-
    sage Router Directory Service (DDS) and Digital X.500 Directory Sys-
    tem Agent (DSA).

                                                         August 1996

                                                         AE-QV8GA-TE

 

 o  Enhancements to the MAILbus Management Utility (MBMAN) to allow bulk
    modification and content reporting for subscriber objects held in
    the permanent database on the local node.

 FEATURES

 o  Directory synchronisation, within the context of MAILbus, involves
    using the subscriber entries in a Message Router Directory Service
    (DDS) network to populate a Digital X.500 Directory Service with
    replicas from DDS. Then, when users have directory entries in DDS
    and in X.500, they can operate both directory services simultane-
    ously. However, whilst operating both directory services, any changes
    applied in either DDS or X.500 Directory Service must also be ap-
    plied to the corresponding entry in the other directory service.
    Maintaining directory entries in this way is known as directory syn-
    chronisation.
    The directory sychroniser, XDDS, offers two-way synchronization of
    user information between DDS and X.500. It includes the means to
    add and update DDS/X.500 replica information within the associated
    directory structure, optionally including MAILbus 400 routing in-
    formation in X.500. It also checks for potential name clashes amongst
    the replica entries generated in X.500 from source entries in DDS,
    plus deletion of DDS/X.500 replica information when original, source
    entries have been removed.

 o  Provision of customizable mapping rules to map attributes between
    directory entries. The mapping rules are based on a powerful list-
    based command language developed specifically for the purpose of
    synchronization.

 o  Facility to create Digital X.500 Directory Service tree structures,
    to hold DDS replica information in person entry and MTS routing struc-
    tures. The Directory Information Tree (DIT) Builder can be run sep-
    arately from the Directory synchronisation part of XDDS, to cre-
    ate the directory subtrees that are needed in X.500. User configuarable
    DDS to X.500 mapping rules are used to derive the values needed to
    create a distinguished name for an entry in the user information

    subtree. These mapping rules are also used to create the O/R ad-
    dress terms needed to create an O/R address entry.

 o  Message Router MBMAN utility has been enhanced to allow manipula-
    tion of several DDS subscriber entries with a single (MBMAN) com-
    mand. These enhancements include operations, such as SELECT and UP-
    DATE, on multiple subscribers in DDS, and the ability to review the
    DDS database for consistency (SUMMARIZE command).

    The Directory Migration Toolkit license allows the enhanced MBMAN
    Utility to be installed and run on any system that is licensed to
    run Message Router V3.3A

 o  Diagnostic Tools. XDDS runs in batch mode for continuous synchro-
    nization, but to aid testing your customizations, XDDS can also run
    in debug mode or to simulate database synchronizations.

 o  Error reporting and log facilities are provided from information
    logged in a summary log file, and, if running in batch mode, the
    batch log file.

 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

 Any OpenVMS VAX configuration supported by
 DECnet[TM]/OSI[R] and Message Router for OpenVMS VAX, with the excep-
 tion of those listed below. See the DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS VAX Soft-
 ware Product Description (SPD) (25.03.*) and VAX Message Router SPD
 (26.33.*) for further information on supported hardware configurations.

 Processors Not Supported

 MicroVAX[TM] I, VAXstation[TM] I, VAX-11/725, VAX-11/782, VAXstation
 8000

 Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1):

 Disk space required for    3200 blocks
 installation:

 DMT will require 3200 blocks of disk space to install. Run time re-
 quirements may be greater depending on frequency of execution and level
 of logging requested. In addition, the disk space requirements for the
 associated directory products need to be considered; if the customer
 has a large population in one directory, then it would be prudent to
 ensure that the other directory has the resources needed to accommo-
 date the replicas. See SPD/SSAs: VAX Message Router #26.33.*; for Dig-
 ital X.500 Directory Service #40.77.*.

 CLUSTER ENVIRONMENT

 This layered product is fully supported when installed as single log-
 ical instance on any valid and licensed VMScluster[TM]* configuration.

    ware Product Description (29.78.xx) and include CI[TM], Ethernet,
