 

 This SPD describes Digital SNA APPC/LU6.2 Programming Interface for
 OpenVMS, which is available for the OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS AXP plat-
 forms. All information applies to both platforms unless otherwise in-
 dicated.

 DESCRIPTION

 The Digital SNA Advanced Program-to-Program Communications/Logical Unit
 6.2 (APPC/LU6.2) Programming Interface for OpenVMS is a layered soft-
 ware product that allows user-written applications running on suit-
 ably configured OpenVMS systems either within a DECnet network or run-
 ning VMS/SNA software to exchange messages with cooperating applica-
 tions in an IBM[R] host. The APPC software exists in the OpenVMS sys-
 tem as a shareable image. Access between the cooperating Digital and
 IBM applications is via one of the following products:

 o  Digital Peer Server

 o  Digital SNA Gateway for Synchronous Transport

 o  Digital SNA Gateway for Channel Transport

 o  DEC SNA Domain Gateway for Channel Transport

 o  VMS/SNA - an OpenVMS VAX layered product that supports users on the
    system where VMS/SNA is running

 The APPC product is a set of subroutines which are called by OpenVMS
 programs which act as LU6.2 transaction application programs. These
 subroutines allow an OpenVMS transaction application to:

 o  Activate and deactivate sessions

 o  Allocate and deallocate LU6.2 basic and mapped conversations

 o  Send and receive data

 o  Request confirmation and confirm transactions

 o  Send and receive error information

 o  Define and delete local LU names and TP names

 o  Supply program initialization parameters

                                                          April 1996

                                                         AE-ET90J-TE

 

 o  Supply session-level security and inbound conversation level se-
    curity

 o  Allow outbound conversation allocation

 o  Notify the user application of session failure

 o  Notify the user application of conversation deallocation

 Features

 The APPC product provides features to assist the user in writing and
 executing the OpenVMS transaction program. The APPC product performs
 the SNA communications function on the programmer's behalf, allowing
 the user to concentrate on solving the application problem rather than
 having to learn about the underlying communications medium. Because
 the APPC product performs all the SNA functions on the user's behalf,
 users are not required to have a knowledge of SNA.

 The verbs comprising the APPC product are defined to make the indi-
 vidual subroutine calls correspond to the verbs defined in the IBM man-
 ual, SNA Transaction Programmers Reference Manual for Logical Unit 6.2.
 This makes it easier for IBM application level programmers to code Open-
 VMS LU6.2 programs.

 The APPC product implements both the basic and mapped conversation verb
 set using the same procedure calls. The OpenVMS programmer may choose
 which type of conversation is desired by specifying the appropriate
 symbolic code in the TYPE parameter of the SNALU62$ALLOCATE procedure.

 Both sets of verbs can be synchronous or asynchronous. Asynchronous
 completion of verbs allows for multithreaded applications to use the
 LU6.2 interface without blockage.

 The following sections describe the supported and unsupported verbs.

 the following languages:

 INSTALLATION

                                  5

 

 Digital recommends that a customer's first purchase of this software
 product include Digital Installation Services. These services provide
 for installation of the software product by an experienced Digital Soft-
 ware Specialist.

 For subsequent purchases of this product, only experienced customers
 should attempt installation. Digital recommends that all other cus-
 tomers purchase Digital's Installation Services.

 Customer Responsibilities

 Before installation of the software, the customer must:

 o  Previously have installed all requisite hardware including termi-
    nals;

 o  Obtain, install, and demonstrate as operational any modems and other
    equipment and facilities necessary to interface to Digital's com-
    munications equipment;

 o  Demonstrate equivalency of operation for modems other than Bell[TM]
    System 201C, 208A or 209A, AT&T[TM] 2596, 2556, Data Phone[TM] II
    (2096A, Digital 2500, or equivalent) type modems or, in Europe, PTT
    approved modems;

 o  Have generated, to Digital's satisfaction, any necessary IBM host
    software that will be communicating with the SNA gateway or VMS/SNA
    and the APPC Programming Interface;

 o  Make available for a reasonable period of time, as mutually agreed
    by Digital and the customer, all hardware, communications facil-
    ities, and terminals that are to be used during installation.

 Delays caused by any failure to meet these responsibilities will be
 charged at the prevailing rate for time and materials.

 Successful use of this product requires that:

 o  the customer must be prepared to work with both Digital and IBM sys-
    tems personnel to coordinate the preinstallation activities;

                                  6
