           PRODUCT NAME: HUBwatch for OpenVMS VAX, Version 3.1   SPD 45.74.04

           DESCRIPTION

           HUBwatch for OpenVMS VAX is a layered product on OpenVMS VAX that is
           designed to manage Digital's DEChub family of products. You can in-
           stall in one of two ways:

           o  As an add-on application to POLYCENTER products for OpenVMS VAX.

           o  As a standalone application with OpenVMS VAX, DEC TCP/IP Services
              for OpenVMS VAX or TGV MultiNet[R], Bookreader, and OpenVMS VAX DECwin-
              dows Motif[R].

           The HUBwatch application is a flexible SNMP management tool that runs
           in the Motif windows environment. The graphical user interface (GUI)
           allows you to configure DEChubs and GIGAswitch, and to view the sta-
           tus and activity of Hub modules and GIGAswitch components. Award win-
           ning context-sensitive help is available on every screen.

           HUBwatch for OpenVMS VAX V3.1 supports these new DEChub modules:

           PEswitch 900TX    DECrepeater 90TS
           DECrepeater       DECswitch 900EE
           90T+
           GIGAswitch FGL4   DECswitch 900EF
           RoamAbout
           Access Point

           You invoke the HUBwatch application either by selecting an icon on a
           POLYCENTER network map or as a standalone application. A DECwindows
           Motif window displays the front panel view of the selected device.

           The Hub Front Panel window display includes the hub configuration and
           status of each module and module port. HUBwatch for OpenVMS VAX in-
           corporates both a Physical and Logical hub front panel view. The Phys-
           ical View depicts an exact representation of the hub's front panel.
           The Logical Hub View provides the same technical data, but uses a stan-
           dard module template with labels and icons to distinguish module types.
           Both views, physical and logical, provide for access to hub module man-
           agement windows and options.

           To access hub module management windows, you "double click" on a mod-
           ule in the Hub Front Panel window. Both the graphical Physical and Log-
           ical hub views have "hot-spots," such as the port connectors. Another
           window opens when you click on hot-spots, containing information and
           controls that are specific to that module or port.

           HUBwatch uses SNMP to manage the DEChub 900MS, DEChub 90, DEChub One
           and GIGAswitch products. These products include:

           DECrepeater    DECserver     DECbridge 90

           HUBwatch uses SNMP agents to manage the DEChub and GIGAswitch prod-
           ucts. An SNMP Agent is an entity in a hardware device that executes
           SNMP requests. The following hardware devices contain integral SNMP
           Agents that HUBwatch manages.

           DEChub 900MS     DECrepeater 900TM
           DECagent 90      DECrepeater 900GM

           900MX
           PEswitch 900TX   DECconcentrator 900MX

           HUBwatch manages SNMP agents that are identified in the HUBwatch Agents
           file. The Agent Summary window allows you to add and delete SNMP agents
           and modify operating information for the Agent.

           Management of a DEChub 90 requires a DECagent 90 on the LAN, and a bus
           master services module in the DEChub 90. A bus master services mod-
           ule may be a DECbridge 90, DECbridge 90FL or DECagent 90 running V2.0
           firmware. Using bus master services, DEChub 90 slot information can
           be displayed through HUBwatch.

           The DECagent 90 SNMP agent is required to provide the SNMP interface
           between HUBwatch for DEChub 90 modules installed in a DEChub 90. The
           HUBwatch program displays the hub configuration on the Front Panel View,
           showing the status of modules and ports at a glance. HUBwatch uses the
           information in the DECagent 90's database to display hub configura-
           tions.

           Basic management of the DECagent 90 is also available through its setup
           port. The setup port of the DECagent 90 further enables the user to
           turn DECrepeater 90 ports on and off, and remote MOP management of DECbridges,
           DECservers and DECrepeater 90s (through a DECbridge). MOP management
           is not available for the DECrepeater 90FS or 90TS. The DECagent 90 setup
           can also be accessed via a Serial Line IP (SLIP) connection.

           Management of the DEChub 900MS requires an IP Services module to be
           installed and identified in the DEChub 900MS. Modules that currently
           provide IP Services are:

           DECrepeater      DECswitch 900EF
           90TS
           DECrepeater      DECswitch 900EF
           90FS
           DECrepeater      PEswitch 900TX
           900TM
           DECrepeater      DECconcentrator 900MX
           900FP
           DECrepeater      DECbridge 900MX
           900GM

           You can use either a "90 Style" or "900 Style" to manage DECrepeater
           90 90C, 90T, 90T+, 90FA and 90FL modules installed in a DEChub 900MS.
           "90 Style" management emulates DEChub 90 management, and requires a
           DECagent 90 and bus master services. "900 Style" management uses the
           IETF compliant MIBs and the DEChub 900MS Hub Manager. HUBwatch screens
           supporting the IETF compliant MIBs are displayed, but the non-applicable
           functions for the particular DEChub 90 repeater module are disabled.
           No additional management features are available for the DEChub 90 re-
           peater modules managed with "900 Style", but the requirement of the
           DECagent 90 and bus master services is eliminated.

           DEChub One, or standalone, management is limited to those products with
           integral SNMP management agents, and to the DECbridge 90, DECbridge
           90FL and DECserver 90L+, providing there is a DECagent 90 on the same
           extended LAN.

           The following modules are displayed with a front bezel only. No mod-
           ule management is available for these products.

           DECwanrouter     DECmau 900TL
           90
           MUXserver 90     DECrepeater 900TL
           DECpacketprobe   DECrepeater 900SL
           90

           HUBwatch manages the DECbrouter 90 by displaying a module summary screen
           and affording the user an ability to create a TELNET session to the
           device.

           Full management of modules is available through the Module Summary and
           associated detail level screens. In general, DEChub module management
           incorporates a Module Summary screen, and one or more detail level screens.
           The Summary screen displays administrative information and summary op-
           erational status of the module. The user may enter some customized de-
           scriptive information, such as location. Some modules display summary
           operations data, such as traffic summary data. Access to detail level
           screens is available by double clicking on the appropriate port or but-
           ton.

           Full graphical management of the DEChub 900MS is also available through
           its Out-of-Band port. The Out-of-Band management port on the DEChub
           900MS requires SNMP to be run over a SLIP (Serial Line IP) connection.
           The SLIP connection is established by connecting a terminal server that
           supports SLIP, such as the DEcserver 900TM, to the DEChub 900MS. A SLIP
           connection from the terminal server port to the out-of-band port on
           the DEChub 900MS provides the necessary communications path. HUBwatch
           can communicate out-of-band through the terminal server, which for-
           wards the SNMP packet through its SLIP port to the Hub Manager. HUB-
           watch for Windows V2.0 and higher , a companion software product, also
           provides a SLIP networking capability for MS-Windows users.

           The addition, deletion and modification of communities is accomplished
           in the Community Table window.

           Using the DECagent 90, one to sixty four communities can be managed,
           one of which will always be the community in which the DECagent 90 re-
           sides. However, practical limits are much lower and are performance
           dependent. For hubs that contain only bridge and repeater modules, Dig-
           ital recommends that there be one DECagent 90 for every sixteen sin-
           gle hubs or every 8 double hubs. For hubs that contain terminal servers,
           the maximum number of modules managed by one DECagent 90 should not
           exceed 64.

           The DEChub 900MS Hub Manager restricts communities to the local DEChub
           900MS backplane. A single hub can have one to nine communities. Mod-
           ules installed in a DEChub 900MS that have their own SNMP agent would
           also be assigned a unique community name.

           The DEChub 900MS has multiple flexible channels that can be used to
           create independent LAN segments. HUBwatch allows you to create and delete
           the LAN segments from the LAN Interconnect window. LAN segments are
           assigned a name, and technology type, using a menu. HUBwatch Version
           3.1 supports the creation and deletion of additional Ethernet and FDDI
           LAN segments. At this time, available DEChub 900 modules only utilize
           6 Ethernet flexible channels, and the "thinwire" channel.

           Modules or ports may be connected to different LAN segments by "drag-
           ging" (using the mouse) the desired connection to the appropriate LAN
           segment. Safeguards are implemented to prevent inappropriate LAN con-
           nections. Modules with the capability to interconnect more than four
           ports (for example, the DECswitch 900EF) have an associated LAN In-
           terconnect Expanded View screen to display and connect all ports. The
           Station Configuration View is used to configure ports between the front
           panel and the DEChub backplane. The Grouping View is used with the DE-
           Crepeater 900FP to group ports onto different LANs.

           "Find Address" and "Find Duplicate Addresses" are functions that search
           across all Agents defined in the HUBwatch Agents file for stations con-
           nected to a managed Ethernet repeater.

           DECbridge 900MX, DECswitch 900EF and DECswitch 900EE MAC Address and
           protocol filtering and forwarding management are performed on detail
           views available from the Bridge Summary Screen.

           Alarmed Agents that the HUBwatch alarms software can monitor may be
           specified for Trap conditions. Traps occur when the module's firmware
           monitors the hardware for specific faults and an alarm message is sent
           to HUBwatch's monitoring software. Alarm management windows allow the
           user to start and stop the Alarms Poller, display alarms and the alarms
           log file, and add, delete and modify alarm agents.

           Traps supported in HUBWatch V3.1 are described in Table 1.

           there is only a Physical Front Panel View for the GIGAswitch/FDDI. The
           eight management windows allow the user to perform full management of
           the switch. In addition to the Summary Front Panel and System Summary
           Views, detail screens allow you to manage line cards, MAC Information
           and port details. Other screens enable filtering, and management of
           line card and bridge functions. Using SNMP, setting filters can be a
           complex and time consuming task. HUBwatch simplifies this task through
           the use of an innovative GUI. HUBwatch V3.1 adds support for the 4 port
           FGL4 card.
