          PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER Framework Historian Option, V1.4      SPD
                                  (formerly DECmcc Historical Data Pack-
          39.73.02                age)

          INTRODUCTION

          POLYCENTER Framework Historian Option is one of several separately
          available options to add functionality to the basic POLYCENTER
          Framework. They add specific management functions and are also
          included in the comprehensive POLYCENTER Network Manager products.
          These add-on options offer management functions and protocol support
          for different network and system management environments. POLYCENTER
          Network Management Module Packages can be installed and used
          separately or in any combination with the POLYCENTER Framework. The
          management services provided by newly installed modules are
          automatically enrolled in the POLYCENTER Framework and are available
          to management services already installed.

          POLYCENTER Framework software is the minimum prerequisite software
          product for POLYCENTER Management Modules such as the POLYCENTER
          Framework Historian Option Package. Refer to the POLYCENTER Network
          Management Services Software Product Description (SPD 37.20.xx) for a
          list of the POLYCENTER products and module packages, and for a
          description of their relationship to each other and to the Digital
          Enterprise Management Architecture (EMA).

          DESCRIPTION

          The POLYCENTER Framework Historian Option enables users to collect,
          time stamp, and store management data. This data is then available to
          users or to other POLYCENTER management services, such as the POLY-
          CENTER Notification Option and the POLYCENTER Network Statistics Op-
          tion. The POLYCENTER Framework Historian Option also includes a data

          export function that enables users to write historical data, or other
          attribute data, to an external relational database for additional pro-
          cessing and report generation. The data export functions of the
          POLYCENTER Framework Historian Option require the use of INGRES[TM] on
          RISC/ULTRIX systems or Rdb Runtime on OpenVMS systems.

          For OpenVMS:
          
          Disk space          1,040 blocks on the system disk
          required for

          IMPORTANT INTEROPERABILITY INFORMATION FOR OPENVMS USERS ONLY

          Interoperability problems may occur when more than one product con-
          taining DECthreads is installed on a system. This occurs because some
          products overwrite the system version of DECthreads. If a product with
          a different version of DECthreads is installed after POLYCENTER Frame-
          work, problems may occur.

          POLYCENTER Framework V1.4 is linked with DECthreads V1.0-422. Later
          versions of DECthreads have a backwards compatible API. Consequently,
          no problem should result from having a more recent version of
          DECthreads on the system.

          Only SSB versions of DECthreads are supported.

          SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS FOR OPENVMS

          For Systems Using Terminals (no DECwindows Motif interface):

          o  OpenVMS VAX Operating System V5.5-2 to V6.1
