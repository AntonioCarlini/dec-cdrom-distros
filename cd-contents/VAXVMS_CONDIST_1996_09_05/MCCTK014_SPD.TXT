          PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER Framework Developer's Toolkit, Version 1.4
          SPD 32.49.05                (Formerly DECmcc Developer's Toolkit)

          INTRODUCTION

          The POLYCENTER Framework Developer's Toolkit consists of software and
          documentation used in the development of POLYCENTER Network Manage-
          ment 200/400 Access Modules (AMs) and Function Modules (FMs). Avail-
          able in OpenVMS and RISC/ULTRIX versions, the product is intended for
          experienced system software developers.

          The POLYCENTER Framework Developer's Toolkit is one of several prod-
          ucts in the POLYCENTER Product Family, a group of related network and
          system management software products based on the Digital Enterprise
          Management Architecture (EMA). For an overview of these products, re-
          fer to the POLYCENTER Network Management Product Family Overview Soft-
          ware Product Description (SPD 37.20.xx).

          DESCRIPTION

          The POLYCENTER Framework Developer's Toolkit consists of software
          tools and documentation that enable users to design and develop Access
          or Function Modules for the following POLYCENTER Network Manager
          200/400 Family Products:

          o  POLYCENTER Framework (DECmcc Director) (SPD 32.46.xx)

          o  POLYCENTER Network Manager 200 (DECmcc Basic Management System)
             (DECmcc BMS, SPD 32.48.xx)

          o  POLYCENTER Network Manager 400 (DECmcc Enterprise Management Sta-
             tion) (DECmcc EMS, SPD 31.88.xx)


                                        DIGITAL                  January 1995

                                                                  AE-PC88G-TE

 



          POLYCENTER Framework Developer's Toolkit, Version 1.4 SPD 32.49.05
          (Formerly DECmcc Developer's Toolkit)

          Note: POLYCENTER Framework or POLYCENTER Network Manager 200 or POLY-
          CENTER Network Manager 400 software is required for installing, en-
          rolling, testing, and operating management modules developed using the
          POLYCENTER Framework Developer's Toolkit. The POLYCENTER Framework De-
          veloper's Toolkit software simplifies the design and implementation
          of application-specific modules by offering a runtime kernel execu-
          tive, various service programs, and source code for sample Access and
          Function Modules.


          DOCUMENTATION

          The POLYCENTER Framework Developer's Toolkit documentation provides
          information to assist in the design and development of POLYCENTER Net-
          work Management Modules. It includes the following documents:

          o  Enterprise Management Architecture (EMA) General Description

          o  EMA Entity Model

          o  The DECmcc System Reference Manual (SRM Volume 1 & 2)

          o  POLYCENTER Management Module Programming

          o  The POLYCENTER Framework Developer's Toolkit Reference

          The POLYCENTER Module Reference Manuals, available on-line only, pro-
          vide specifications of the services offered and required by each POLY-
          CENTER/DECmcc network management module.

          DEVELOPMENT UTILITIES

          Development utilities and tools that are part of the Toolkit include
          the Design Framework, a sample Access Module, and an example Function
          Module:

          o  POLYCENTER Network Management Design Framework is a set of generic
             software components that enable users to construct a starter Man-
             agement Module. Such a module can be used as a base for the devel-
             opment of application-specific Access or Function Modules. The De-
             sign Framework uses proven development techniques that minimize

             coding errors, expedite development, and reduce coding 
             ambiguities that can arise during module design.

          o  Sample Access Module is a basic example of an AM that can be run
             on a POLYCENTER Network Manager 200/400 or POLYCENTER Framework 
             system. It contains working examples of many of the POLYCENTER 
             Network Manager 200/400 interfaces, including the mcc_call
             interface and calls to many of the POLYCENTER Network Manager
             200/400 routines that enable Management Modules to reside on and
             interoperate within a POLYCENTER Network Manager 200/400 system.
             The Sample AM is implemented using the Design Framework. NOTE: The
             Sample AM explicitly uses Phase IV of DECnet-VAX, or DECnet-ULTRIX.
             If DECnet is unavailable, the Sample AM may be run with the
             transport disabled for illustration purposes only.

          o  Example Function Module contains working examples of common rou-
             tines used by FMs to access the services of the POLYCENTER Network
             Manager system and other FMs and AMs. It is layered on top of the
             Sample AM.

          o  The following utilities are included in the POLYCENTER Framework
             and POLYCENTER Network Manager 200/400 Software and are necessary
             for enrolling application-specific access modules and related files
             into the POLYCENTER Network Management system:

          o  Management Specification Language (MSL) Translator Utility

          o  Dictionary Administrator Program (DAP) Utility

          o  Bed Driver (TBD) Utility

          o  Help File Builder (HFB) Utility

          These utilities allow on-site enrollment of access and function mod-
          ules. The POLYCENTER Framework Developer's Toolkit Reference 
          (AA-PD5MC-TE) describes each utility in detail.

          WARE REQUIREMENTS section details any special hardware required by
          this product.

          IMPORTANT INTEROPERABILITY INFORMATION FOR OPENVMS USERS ONLY

          Interoperability problems may occur when more than one product con-
          taining DECthreads is installed on a system. This occurs because some
          products overwrite the system version of DECthreads. If a product with
          a different version of DECthreads is installed after POLYCENTER Frame-
          work, problems may occur.

          POLYCENTER Framework V1.4 is linked with DECthreads V1.0-422. Later
          versions of DECthreads have a backwards compatible API. Consequently,
          no problem should result from having a more recent version of
          DECthreads on the system.

          Only SSB versions of DECthreads are supported.
