DESCRIPTION

POLYCENTER Accounting Chargeback for OpenVMS

The POLYCENTER Accounting Chargeback product uses OpenVMS accounting
data to produce system utilization reports. These reports show mon-
etary amounts charged for various types of system resources based on
unit prices provided by the user. The reports can be used as itemized
bills or as general resource utilization reports.

Features

POLYCENTER Accounting Chargeback provides the user with the capabil-
ities to identify the consumers of system resources. It also facil-
itates the allocation of cost to the consumers of those resources:

o  Uses the OpenVMS accounting files

o  DECwindows Motif[R] interface

o  Price editor to assign a monetary value to the resource units con-
   sumed

o  Disk Usage Reports

                                 2

 

o  Reports based on single jobs, job types, UICs, user accounts, and
   grand totals
