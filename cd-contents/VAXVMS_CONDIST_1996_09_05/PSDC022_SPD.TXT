PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER Performance Data Collector   SPD 36.02.05
               for OpenVMS, Version 2.2

OVERVIEW OF THE PRODUCT FAMILY

POLYCENTER Performance Solution is a family of OpenVMS and UNIX[R] lay-
ered products that reduce the time and effort required to manage and
monitor system performance, as well as plan for future resource re-
quirements. The POLYCENTER Performance Solution family of products are
available on Digital UNIX, OpenVMS, ULTRIX, and other UNIX systems.

The POLYCENTER Performance Solution Family includes a number of prod-
ucts running on various operating systems:

o  POLYCENTER Performance Advisor for OpenVMS (formerly known as DECper-
   formance Solution, or DECps) analyzes data through the application
   of expert system technology. It identifies specific performance prob-
   lems, presents detailed supporting evidence, and makes recommen-
   dations to improve OpenVMS system and VMScluster performance (SPD
   36.03.xx).

o  POLYCENTER Performance Data Collector for OpenVMS gathers and man-
   ages OpenVMS system and VMScluster performance data (SPD 36.02.xx).

o  POLYCENTER Capacity Planner predicts OpenVMS and Digital UNIX sys-
   tem performance levels for various workloads and configurations (SPD
   36.04.xx).

o  POLYCENTER Accounting Chargeback for OpenVMS generates a report of
   charges based on OpenVMS system resource utilization and user spec-
   ified resource pricing (SPD 36.60.xx).

o  POLYCENTER Performance Advisor for Digital UNIX analyzes data through
   the application of expert system technology. It identifies specific
   performance problems, presents detailed supporting evidence, and
   makes recommendations to improve Digital UNIX system performance
   (SPD 64.08.xx).

o  POLYCENTER Performance Advisor Collector for Digital UNIX (SPD 64.22.xx)
   gathers and manages Digital UNIX system performance data for the
   POLYCENTER Performance Advisor.

o  POLYCENTER Performance Solution for UNIX is comprised of the POLY-
   CENTER Performance Monitor and POLYCENTER Performance Data Collec-
   tors for ULTRIX RISC and VAX, DEC OSF/1, HP-UX[R], AIX[R], Solaris[R],
   and the SunOS operating systems (SPD 46.97.xx).

   Note: Please Note that Data Collectors are not interchangeable be-
   tween the Advisor and the Monitor.

DESCRIPTION

POLYCENTER Performance Data Collector for
OpenVMS

The POLYCENTER Performance Data Collector provides performance data
collection, archiving, reporting, PC sampling, and a file activity dis-
play for OpenVMS systems. Data collected by the POLYCENTER Performance
Data Collector on VAX and Alpha systems can be analyzed by the POLY-
CENTER Performance Advisor and POLYCENTER Capacity Planner.

Data Collection and Storage

The POLYCENTER Performance Data Collector collects data according to
a user-defined schedule. The user may specify the classes of infor-
mation to be collected and the sampling frequency. Any number of col-
lections can be defined and active on the target system.

The Data Collector requires sufficient disk space to store performance
data. In the absence of sufficient space, it automatically suspends
recording of performance data until space becomes available.

Dump Report

                                 2

 

The Dump Report displays unanalyzed data from the POLYCENTER Perfor-
mance Solution database files in user-readable format. The user may
report any or all of the following data collection categories in this
report:

o  Metrics

o  Parameters

o  Processes

o  Disks and disk caches

o  Tapes

o  Communications

o  System configuration and SCS

o  CPU

o  Rules

o  Hotfiles

Data Archiving

The POLYCENTER Performance Data Collector provides data archiving ca-
pabilities to enable long-term data analysis. Daily Performance So-
lution data files are archived into history files, which the POLYCEN-
TER Performance Advisor can use to generate Performance Evaluation Re-
ports, Analysis Reports, and Graphs.

The user defines specifically how the data is to be archived and can
specify the granularity, periodicity, time interval, workload char-
acterization schema, retention period, schedule, and holiday sched-
ule. The size of the history file is dependent on the data reduction
scheme selected.

System Program Counter Reporting

                                 3

 

System Program Counter (PC) sampling and reporting provides detailed
CPU analysis for a system, OpenVMS executive module, or process. These
reports can be used to determine the amount of CPU time spent in:

o  User, supervisory, executive, and kernel modes

o  System services

o  FDT routines

o  Device drivers

o  RMS

o  Interrupt priority level (IPL)

Histograms provide information on CPU utilization distribution by IPL.

Event Trace Facility (OpenVMS VAX Version Only)

The Event Trace Facility (ETF) is a collection of OpenVMS system ser-
vices that can be used to monitor and record events occurring in the
OpenVMS executive. It is especially suited for solving complex per-
formance data collection tasks for OpenVMS executive routines and de-
vice drivers. The facility provides the routines needed to initial-
ize itself, define and activate trace points, pass control to user-
written data collection routines, and perform buffer and record man-
agement. Language support for calling ETF system services include BLISS-
32, VAX C, VAX Pascal, and VAX BASIC, as well as VAX MACRO.

Disk Space Analysis

Disk Space Analysis reports on the usage of allocated and available
space on a disk. This information assists in determining the level of
file fragmentation and the efficiency of space occupied by the files
on the disk. This analysis also provides volume information that is
set during initialization of the disk.

File Activity Display

                                 4

 

The File Activity Display identifies the files on a disk that are most
frequently accessed. This real-time display is beneficial in locat-
ing file related performance problems. The I/O rate, read percentage,
number of references to the file, and file name are displayed for each
active file of the selected disk.

Features

The POLYCENTER Performance Data Collector has these features:

o  Support for standalone and clustered VAX and Alpha systems

o  The collected system data can be archived into history data files

o  DECwindows Motif[R] interface for customizing data collection and
   viewing data collection reports

o  Conversion of VAX Software Performance Monitor (SPM) history files
   into POLYCENTER Performance Data Collector format

o  Formatted reporting of the collected data

o  The following data collection parameters can be set by the user:

   -  Collection interval

   -  Collection schedule

   -  Number of active collection streams

   -  Classes of data to collect

   -  Location (device and directory) of collection files

o  System PC sampling and reporting to perform detailed CPU utiliza-
   tion analysis

o  The Event Trace Facility provides a callable interface for user-
   written data collection for OpenVMS VAX

o  Dynamic file activity display to monitor busy files

o  Disk Space Analysis for determining disk fragmentation and effi-
   ciency

                                 5

 

o  Provides the necessary data used by the POLYCENTER Performance Ad-
   visor and Capacity Planner products

o  Provides data to the POLYCENTER Performance Advisor DECwindows Mo-
   tif and character cell RealTime Displays
