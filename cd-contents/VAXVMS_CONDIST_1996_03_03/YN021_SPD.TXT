           PRODUCT NAME:  VAX KMS11-BD/BE HDLC/BSC      SPD 26.55.05
                          Framing Software, Version 2.1

           DESCRIPTION

           The VAX KMS11-BD/BE HDLC/BISYNC (BSC) Framing Firmware con-
           sists of a VMS software driver and firmware for the KMS11-
           BD/BE. The VMS software driver and the KMS11-BD/BE software
           allow VMS users to build and implement custom or standard
           communication protocols without having to program the KMS11-
           BD/BE.

           The KMS11-BD/BE firmware provides the HDLC or BISYNCH (BSC)
           framing of the data, as well as the DMA between the KMS11-
           BD/BE and VAX host. This capability reduces the host of pro-
           cessor overhead associated with character interrupt devices.
           The VAX host is no longer interrupted on each character trans-
           mitted or received, and does not have the software overhead
           associated with determining what to do with each character
           as it is received or transmitted. Rather, an interrupt is
           generated on a message transmitted or received basis, and
           processing then takes place on the entire message.

           The driver is the interface that allows the user to trans-
           mit or receive command, control or message data between VMS
           users, the KMS11-BD/BE firmware, and the remote end of the
           communication line. The VMS software driver for the KMS11-
           BD/BE provides the interface which allows the VMS user to
           send or receive messages for various protocols in the VMS
           host. These messages are sent or received via DMA from the
           KMS11-BD/BE HDLC/BISYNCH Framing Software.

           VAX KMS11-BD/BE HDLC/BSC                    SPD 26.55.05
           Framing Software, Version 2.1

           The purpose of the KMS11-BD/BE firmware is to provide the
           basic HDLC or BISYNCH line framing of the messages received
           or transmitted from the VAX host using a DMA Device. It is
           the responsibility of a host application program (not sup-
           plied with this software) to provide the protocol line con-
           trol. This program can be written in a higher level language
           supported on VMS systems.

           Features

           o  Full duplex operation

           o  Integrated level 2R (on-line) diagnostic support

           o  Integrated UETP (User Environment Test Program) support

           o  Support of KMS11-BD/BE HDLC/BISYNCH Framing Firmware

           o  Loading of the firmware into the KMS11-BD/BE

           o  Modem initialization, deinitialization

           o  Transmit data

           o  Receive data

           o  Statistics

           o  User ability to interface via higher level language (e.g.,
              FORTRAN)

           Major features provided by the KMS11-BD/BE HDLC/BISYNCH Fram-
           ing Firmware

           o  HDLC or BISYNCH framing by line
