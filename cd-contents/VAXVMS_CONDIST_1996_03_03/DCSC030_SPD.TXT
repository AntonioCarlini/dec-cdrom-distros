           PRODUCT NAME:  Digital Cartridge Server Component for OpenVMS, 
           Version 3.0                                      SPD 33.59.03

           DESCRIPTION

           The Digital Cartridge Server Component (DCSC) for OpenVMS provides 
           the software front-end interface to the StorageTek[R] Automated 
           Cartridge System (StorageTek[R] ACS) and Digital's Automated Tape 
           Libraries. It can be installed on either a single OpenVMS system or 
           a VMScluster. Both VAX and Alpha AXP architectures are supported.

           DCSC manages the library resources within an OpenVMS system. This in-
           cludes managing the allocation of ACS transports, locking and unlock-
           ing both cartridge and transport resources to accommodate user tape
           function requests, and recovering any unused resources (caused by a
           user mounting a tape and logging out before dismounting it).

           When a user requests a tape function such as mount, DCSC checks for
           the existence of the requested cartridge, selects an available trans-
           port, and locks the required resources. DCSC ensures the tape 
           cartridge is physically loaded onto a StorageTek[R] transport and, 
           if requested, executes an OpenVMS tape mount function. Once a tape 
           cartridge is mounted, DCSC makes it possible for users to request 
           an OpenVMS copy or backup function to read data from or send data 
           to the cartridge.

           On a VMScluster consisting of several nodes, one node called the Mas-
           ter server node fields requests from the other nodes on the VMSclus-
           ter, which are called Virtual server nodes.

           DCSC provides a variety of sample programs and a sample tape manage-
           ment system. These are provided for demonstration purposes only. Dig-
           ital recommends the use of Digital's SLS tape management system.

           SPD 33.59.03


           The DCSC kit includes the following:

           o  DCSC Run-Time Library (RTL) routines-A set of tools that let pro-
              grammers design applications specific to their system and users.

           o  DCSC DCL Interface - lets users request tape cartridge functions
              (to request a mount of a specific tape cartridge, for example) 
              from the OpenVMS DCL interface.

           o  Configuration File Editor - A menu-driven interface that lets sys-
              tem managers create the configuration file used to describe the 
              transport and ACS environment to DCSC. DCSC reads this file when 
              it starts up and uses it to determine operation, network, and 
              transport resource allocations.

           o  DCSC Server-A set of processes that manage user requests by allo-
              cating transport resources to users on an OpenVMS system. It also
              controls communications between the DCSC components and the Open-
              VMS/ULTRIX Connection software which, in turn, communicate with 
              the StorageTek[R] ACS (UCX is not required for installations 
              using the DECLS software).

           The following documentation is available:

           o  Digital Cartridge Server Component Installation Guide -Explains 
              how to install the DCSC using VMSINSTAL and provides a sample 
              installation log file.

           o  Digital Cartridge Server Component System Manager's Guide - 
              Describes the DCSC, how it works with the robotic tape library, 
              configuration tasks, how to use the Configuration File Editor 
              system, and DCSC-specific system maintenance tasks.

           o  Digital Cartridge Server Component Programmer's Reference Guide -
              Describes the DCSC RTL routines and describes how to use them by
              providing examples of C code fragments.

           o  Digital Cartridge Server Component User's Reference Guide - Sum-
              marizes the main functions of the DCSC, highlighting the functions
              performed by general users, such as mounting and dismounting 
              tapes. In addition, it describes how to use the DCSC cartridge 
              DCL commands.

           The processor used must be sufficiently capable of handling both the
           installation and daily operations of the Digital Cartridge Server 
           Component (DCSC) as well as any customized applications and the 
           OpenVMS/ULTRIX Connection software.

           SPD 33.59.03


           A TK50 Tape Drive or a CD-ROM reader is required for DCSC installa-
           tion.

           An Ethernet connection is required for each processor that uses the
           DCSC. That processor must support the Ethernet boards supported by 
           Version 2.0 of the OpenVMS/ULTRIX Connection software.

           Other Hardware Required:

           There are two possible data path connections to the StorageTek[R] 
           ACS:

              The VAX or AXP processors that are connected to an HSC40/60/65/70
              /90/95 can utilize either a TC44-AA or TC44-BA controller board to
              provide a data path to the StorageTek[R] transports.
              Systems that have an XMI backplane can use the KCM44 to establish
              a data path to the StorageTek[R] transports.

           Configurations using Digital's Automated Tape Libraries use SCSI de-
           vices to connect to the transports in the library.

           Digital Equipment Corporation VT220, VT240, VT320, or VT340 terminal
           to use the DCSC utilities and user interface.

           the Odetics 5480 ATL, Digital TL820 and Digital's DECLS software.

           Disk Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1):

           The following counts refer to the disk space required on the VAX sys-
           tem disk. Notice that the sizes listed are approximate; actual sizes
           may vary depending on your system environment, configuration, and 
           software options.

           Disk space required for     8,000 blocks
           installation:
                                       (4.1 Mbytes)

                                       (3.8 Mbytes)

           The following counts refer to the disk space required on the Alpha 
           AXP system disk. Notice that the sizes listed are approximate; 
           actual sizes may vary depending on your system environment, 
           configuration, and software options.

           Disk space required for     15,000 blocks
           installation:
                                       (7.7 Mbytes)

           Disk space required for     14,000 blocks
           use (permanent):
                                       (7.2 Mbytes)

           The minimum memory supported is 32 Mbytes. However, increasing the 
           memory capability improves the performance of this software. The 
           memory size suggested for most typical hardware configurations is 
           at least 32 Mbytes.
