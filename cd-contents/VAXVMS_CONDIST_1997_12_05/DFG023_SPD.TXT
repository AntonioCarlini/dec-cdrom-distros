 PRODUCT NAME:  Disk File Optimizer                     SPD 55.85.05
                for OpenVMS, Version 2.3

 DESCRIPTION

 The Disk File Optimizer (formerly named POLYCENTER File Optimizer) for
 OpenVMS is a layered software product which reduces both file frag-
 mentation and freespace fragmentation and optimizes file placement on
 disk media. This results in better application performance, better backup
 performance, and more efficient disk utilization. Disk File Optimizer
 operates in two modes. In "Defrag PLUS" mode, RMS is used as a database
 of scheduling information, and defragmentation jobs can be scheduled
 using a wide variety of scheduling criteria. In normal "Defrag" mode,
 defragmentation jobs are run when requested by the user. The user or
 system manager can specify which of these two modes should be used when
 the product is installed.

 The key capabilities of the Disk File Optimizer for OpenVMS are:

 o  Reduces file fragmentation and freespace fragmentation for disk de-
    vices

 o  Provides the ability to defragment specific files or an entire disk

 o  Gives the user the capability to select or exclude specific files
    based on:

    -  User choice

    -  Severity of fragmentation

    -  Whether the file has placement pointers

    -  Whether the files are indexed

                                                           July 1997

                                                         AE-Q6M7F-TE

 

 o  Provides event based scheduling of defragmentation jobs

 o  Provides a Monitor function which allows File Optimizer processes
    to be monitored while in operation

 o  Allows pre- and post-processing commands to effect automation of
    tasks before and after defragmentation jobs are executed

 o  Gives the user the ability to classify files as "hot" (frequently
    accessed), or "cold" (infrequently accessed) and to have them placed
    on the disk drive accordingly

 o  Provides two modes of operation to tailor to the specific customer
    environment

 o  Offers a choice of Digital Command Line (DCL) or Motif[R]-based Graph-
    ical User Interfaces. This is available for both Defrag and Defrag
    PLUS modes.

 o  Provides an offline defragmentation utility that allows the user
    to defragment INDEXF.SYS on a disk device that is not mounted. For
    a bound volume set this utility only works on the "ROOT" volume.

 41.87.XX).

 OPTIONAL SOFTWARE

 o  POLYCENTER Performance Data Collector for OpenVMS V2.1 or later.

    The POLYCENTER Performance Data Collector and POLYCENTER Perfor-
    mance Advisor software are required to use the automated hot file
    placement option. This capability requires a valid license for POLY-
    CENTER Performance Data Collector but does not require purchase of

                                  4

 

    a license for POLYCENTER Performance Advisor. The binaries for both
    the POLYCENTER Performance Data Collector and POLYCENTER Perfor-
    mance Advisor must be accessible to Disk File Optimizer. These bi-
    naries are available on the OpenVMS Software Product Library on CD-
    ROM (see the ORDERING INFORMATION section for part numbers). In or-
    der for Disk File Optimizer to place "hot" files using data sup-
    plied by POLYCENTER Performance Data Collector and POLYCENTER Per-
    formance Advisor, the Disk File Optimizer must be running on a sys-
    tem that also has the POLYCENTER Performance Advisor and POLYCEN-
    TER Data Collector installed on it.

 o  VMS DECwindows Motif V1.1 or later.

    VMS DECwindows Motif is part of the OpenVMS Operating System but
    must be installed separately. Installation of VMS DECwindows Mo-
    tif gives you the option to use the Disk File Optimizer graphical
    user interface.
