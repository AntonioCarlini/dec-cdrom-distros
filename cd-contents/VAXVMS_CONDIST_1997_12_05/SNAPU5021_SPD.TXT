PRODUCT NAME:  DIGITAL[TM] SNA Domain Gateway,         SPD 38.69.03
               Version 2.1A

DESCRIPTION

The DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway (Domain Gateway) is a member of 
DIGITAL's family of DIGITAL SNA network transport products. This 
family consists of hardware and software products that connect suitably 
configured networked systems in a DIGITAL environment with suitably 
configured IBM[R] systems in a SystemsNetwork Architecture (SNA) envi-
ronment. With appropriate OpenVMS[TM], DIGITAL UNIX[R], DECnet-Plus
(formerly DECnet/OSI), and Windows[R] access routines, users can 
exchange information and share resources between DIGITAL and IBM net-
worked systems in a bidirectional manner.

The Domain Gateway is managed and configured using the management soft-
ware that is part of the Domain Gateway product.

The Domain Gateway supports TCP/IP and DECnet-Plus network protocols.
Networks using these protocols are referred to as the non-SNA networks.
The Domain Gateway is part of both the SNA network and the non-SNA net-
work. Architecturally, it is a DECnet-Plus and/or TCP/IP end node and
an SNA Physical Unit Type 5 (PU T5) node. The Domain Gateway appears
to the SNA network as an SNA domain that contains one subarea.

The DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway software is supported on the DEC[TM]
ChannelServer[TM] II hardware platform [DESNB] and the DEC MicroServer
hardware platform [DEMSA]. [Note: The DEC ChannelServer II [DESNB] hard-
ware only is retired. However, support for the product (software and
hardware) will continue. For details, please contact your local DIG-
ITAL representative.] When used with the Domain Gateway software, each

                                                           May 1997

of these hardware products provides SNA connectivity to any DECnet-
Plus or TCP/IP system in the non-SNA network.

The DEC ChannelServer II hardware unit connects directly to an Eth-
ernet local area network (LAN), using a standard Ethernet transceiver
cable, and to an IBM S/370 Block Multiplexer channel, using a single
set of Bus and Tag connectors. The combination of the Domain Gateway
software and the DEC ChannelServer II hardware unit is referred to as
a Domain Gateway-CT.

The DEC MicroServer hardware unit connects directly to an Ethernet LAN,
using a standard Ethernet transceiver cable. The DEC MicroServer hard-
ware unit connects to up to four front-end communications controllers
(37**-style), using standard synchronous data lines and modems. These
front-end processors must all be in the same SNA network. The combi-
nation of the Domain Gateway software and the DEC MicroServer hardware
unit is referred to as a Domain Gateway-ST.

This product can be used in networks currently using other DIGITAL SNA
Gateway systems and can share access routines, Ethernet LANs, and load
host resources with those systems.

The Domain Gateway supports a single physical unit (PU) with its own
System Services Control Point (SSCP). The Gateway supports up to 16
explicit routes for each destination subarea in the SNA network, sup-
ports IBM Class of Service capability, and allows up to eight virtual
routes (each of which can have three transmission priority levels) for
each explicit route. The Domain Gateway-CT supports a single trans-
mission group (TG). The Domain Gateway-ST supports multiple (up to four)
TGs and multilink TGs.

The Domain Gateway-CT supports the configuration of up to 1024 log-
ical units (LUs), and the Domain Gateway-ST supports up to 128 LUs.
All LUs can have multiple sessions. Table 1 shows the maximum number
of active LU-LU sessions supported by the two hardware platforms.

Because the Domain Gateway is a PU T5 implementation, it enables DECnet-
Plus based applications to be either primary logical units (PLUs) or
secondary logical units (SLUs) when communicating with IBM applications
and peripheral devices. This means that suitably configured DIGITAL
based applications can be interactively accessed from IBM SNA networked 
3270 devices and PCs.

Features Common to All Domain Gateways

o  Implements an SNA PU T5.

o  Multiple session support for each LU.

o  Supports applications acting as either PLUs or SLUs.

o  Provides access to OpenVMS Alpha, OpenVMS VAX[TM], and DIGITAL UNIX
   applications from SNA 3270 devices and PCs.

o  Implements IBM Class of Service support.

o  Supports SNA explicit routes, virtual routes, and transmission 
   priority levels.

o  Supports a wide variety of access routines.

o  Supports IBM MVS, VM, and VSE systems.

o  Gateway Configuration Utility simplifies installation and config-
   uration.

o  Gateway Management Utilities simplify management and trouble-
   shooting.

                                 3

 

o  Supports SNA-initiated outbound sessions.

o  DECnet-Plus and/or TCP/IP end node implementation.

o  Access from DECnet-Plus or TCP/IP systems.

o  TN3270 Server support.

Features Unique to the Domain Gateway-CT

o  Supports high-bandwidth communication using a block multiplexer 
   channel attachment to an IBM mainframe.

o  Supports up to 1024 active sessions.

o  Is upward compatible with DIGITAL SNA Gateway for Channel Trans-
   port.

Features Unique to the Domain Gateway-ST

o  Supports SNA synchronous communications using the SDLC protocol.

o  Supports SDLC's Extended Response Mode, allowing a window modulo
   of 128.

o  Supports NRZI signaling mode on its synchronous data lines. This
   allows the Domain Gateway to support IBM data lines coded with 
   either the NORMAL or NRZI option for the IBM NCP LINE resource 
   definition.

o  Supports full duplex transmission on its synchronous data lines.
   This allows data to be sent and received simultaneously. This set-
   ting corresponds to the DATMODE = FULL option for the IBM NCP PU
   resource definition.

o  Supports up to 128 active sessions (depending on software license).

o  Is upward compatible with DIGITAL SNA Gateway for Synchronous 
   Transport.

Loading DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway Software

The Domain Gateway software is downline loaded into the DEC 
ChannelServer II or DEC MicroServer product over the Ethernet LAN from 
an OpenVMS Alpha, OpenVMS VAX, or DIGITAL UNIX system, acting as 
DECnet-Plus load hosts. Most OpenVMS Alpha, OpenVMS VAX, and DIGITAL 
UNIX systems can be used as Domain Gateway load hosts. The HARDWARE 
REQUIREMENTS section of this Software Product Description describes 
valid configurations.

Other networked systems requiring access to the SNA environment 
through the Domain Gateway should be configured with the appropriate 
SNA access routines.

When loaded on the DEC ChannelServer hardware unit, the Domain Gateway
appears to the SNA network as an IBM 3088 Channel-to-Channel Adapter
(CTCA). System programmers configure the IBM channel address as a 3088
device according to specifications listed in both the hardware and 
software user documentation.

When loaded on the DEC MicroServer hardware unit, the Domain Gateway
appears to adjacent front-end processors as another front-end proces-
sor and appears to IBM hosts in the SNA network as another IBM host.
IBM system programmers should configure the adjacent front-end pro-
cessors and adjacent IBM hosts according to specifications listed in
both the hardware and software user documentation.

                                 5

 

Components

The DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway software includes two software compo-
nents: the Domain Gateway Load Host software (with its Configuration
Utility) and the Domain Gateway Management software.

Domain Gateway Load Host Software

The Domain Gateway Load Host software includes the system image that
is downline loaded to one of the supported hardware units and the Con-
figuration Utility that provides a convenient method for configuring
the Domain Gateway.

The Configuration Utility allows Domain Gateway managers to save an-
swers and to modify discrete parts of the configuration. The Config-
uration Utility can also read path definition files created by IBM 
network definition utilities and use that information in the Domain 
Gateway configuration.

Because the Domain Gateway supports multiple sessions per LU, the Do-
main Gateway manager can configure a single LU for the access routines
that support multiple sessions, thus reducing configuration time.

Most DIGITAL UNIX, OpenVMS Alpha, and OpenVMS VAX systems can serve
as Domain Gateway load hosts.

Domain Gateway Management Software

The Domain Gateway Management software includes DECnet-Plus style net-
work management tools for configuring, controlling, monitoring, and
troubleshooting the Domain Gateway. The Domain Gateway manager can set
up or modify parameters relating to routes, physical units, logical
units, and other key variables necessary for network-to-network com-
munications between the SNA and non-SNA networks. In addition, the 
Domain Gateway Management software allows the manager to diagnose and
solve most problems related to the Domain Gateway. On DIGITAL UNIX sys-
tems, these DECnet style network management tools are also available
in a TCP/IP-only environment.


                                 6

 

Although all management of the Domain Gateway is performed from a 
Gateway management node in the non-SNA network, the management of the 
Domain Gateway's SNA components is conceptually part of the management
of the IBM SNA network. Therefore, the management of the routes and
the data links connecting the Domain Gateway to the IBM network is the
joint responsibility of the IBM system or network programmer and the
Domain Gateway manager. (Refer to the CUSTOMER RESPONSIBILITIES sec-
tion of this Software Product Description for more information.)

The Domain Gateway Management software includes support for Network
Control Language (NCL) commands, a monitoring utility (SNAP), and Com-
mon Trace Facility (CTF) analysis routines. The SNAP utility displays
the status of the Domain Gateway's buffer availability, the number of
SNA sessions in progress, and information about the non-SNA and SNA
networks. The CTF analysis routines help debug application programs
and assist in identifying system problems by capturing and analyzing
multiprotocol data. CTF can be used at the transmission group, virtual
route, logical unit, or session level.

The Domain Gateway Management software resides on a Domain Gateway load
host system or, optionally, on additional nodes called Domain Gateway
management nodes.

Most DIGITAL UNIX, OpenVMS Alpha, and OpenVMS VAX systems can serve
as Domain Gateway management hosts.

Access Routines

OpenVMS, DIGITAL UNIX, or Windows based DIGITAL access routines can
use the Domain Gateway. The Domain Gateway supports DIGITAL-supplied
access routines as either SLUs or PLUs. For example, the MEP VT[TM]
for DIGITAL SNA 3270 Applications Services access routine enables 3270
terminals in an SNA network to connect to applications on OpenVMS sys-
tems. For additional information about supported access routines, see
the OPTIONAL SOFTWARE section of this Software Product Description.

Compatibility with DIGITAL SNA Gateways

The Domain Gateway works with all of the DIGITAL SNA access routines
except the Distributed Host Command Facility (DHCF). (For more infor-
mation about access routines, refer to the Access Routines and OPTIONAL
SOFTWARE sections of this Software Product Description.) The Domain
Gateway does not have a Remote Job Entry (RJE) server. Instead, the
DIGITAL SNA RJE access routine uses an OpenVMS based RJE server. Also
note that the Domain Gateway does not support the management utili-
ties used for previous DIGITAL SNA Gateways, such as SNANCP, NCP, and
NETTRACE.

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

Processors Supported

For information about supported processors, refer to the Software Prod-
uct Descriptions for the DIGITAL UNIX Operating System (SPD 46.61.xx)
and the OpenVMS Operating System for Alpha and VAX (SPD 25.01.xx).

Processors Not Supported

MicroVAX I[TM], VAXstation[TM] I, VAX-11/725[TM], VAX-11/782, 
VAXstation 8000

Additional Processor Requirements

Every load host on which the Domain Gateway software is installed must
contain:

o  A valid system configuration for the relevant operating system and
   the supporting networking software product. (Refer to the operat-
   ing system's and networking product's Software Product Descriptions
   and to the SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS section of this SPD.)

o  A supported connection on the same Ethernet LAN as the DIGITAL SNA
   Domain Gateway



                                 8

 

o  A CD-ROM device available to read the software during installation

Disk Block Space Requirements

Disk space required     OpenVMS VAX, 37,000 blocks (19 MB)
for                     OpenVMS Alpha,12,000 blocks (6 MB)
installation:           DIGITAL UNIX, 5 MB

Disk space required     OpenVMS VAX, 36,000 blocks (17 MB)
for use                 OpenVMS Alpha, 9,000 blocks (5 MB)
(permanent):            DIGITAL UNIX, 5 MB

These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
system environment, configuration, and software options.

In addition to disk space allocated to the Domain Gateway software,
some disk space (approximately 8K to 10K blocks) should be reserved
for any dump files that may be generated by the Domain Gateway. The
location of these dump files is determined by the system administra-
tor. In addition, each Domain Gateway configured will require addi-
tional disk space for configuration scripts (upwards of 40 blocks 
[20 KB]).

Communications Hardware Required

Domain Gateway software runs on two hardware platforms: the DEC 
ChannelServer II and the DEC MicroServer.

DEC ChannelServer II

The DEC ChannelServer II hardware unit is no longer available, but is
supported by the Domain Gateway software in the following forms:

o  DESNB-AA for use with 120 V ac power supplies

o  DESNB-A3 for use with 240 V ac power supplies



                                 9

 

Each DEC ChannelServer II hardware unit has a built-in Ethernet LAN
controller, but needs a suitable connection to connect to the customer's
Ethernet LAN along with any extension cables.

In addition, S/370 Bus and Tag cables (with terminators, if appropriate)
are required for connection into the S/370 system.

Note: A raised-floor environment is required for installation of a DEC
ChannelServer II system.

DEC MicroServer

The DEC MicroServer is available in the following forms:

o  DEMSA-AA for use with 120 V ac power supplies

o  DEMSA-AB for use with 240 V ac power supplies

The DEC MicroServer-SP is no longer available, but is supported by the
Domain Gateway software in the following forms:

o  DEMSB-AA for use with 120 V ac power supplies

o  DEMSB-AB for use with 240 V ac power supplies

Each DEC MicroServer hardware unit has a built-in Ethernet LAN con-
troller, but needs a suitable connection to connect to the customer's
Ethernet LAN along with any extension cables.

Each DEC MicroServer hardware unit uses adapter cables to provide the
necessary interchange circuits at the appropriate electrical inter-
face types and ISO standard connections for each synchronous line. The
DEC MicroServer supports up to four synchronous lines; therefore, it
requires up to four adapter cables. Table 3 shows the cable number for
each of the supported electrical interfaces.

SOFTWARE LICENSING

Customers need a separate license for each hardware unit they load with
the Domain Gateway software (except as otherwise specified by DIGI-
TAL). The DIGITAL SNA Domain Gateway license applies to the hardware
unit on which the software executes, not to the load host processor
on which the software is configured.

The single Domain Gateway license agreement includes the right to in-
stall and configure the product on a backup load host, in standby mode,
for downline loading the Domain Gateway in case of a failure at the
primary load host. This backup load host installation requires dupli-
cate installation of the primary Product Access Key (PAK).

Under the terms of the software license, the Domain Gateway manage-
ment utilities that are included in this product (NCL commands, SNAP,
and CTF analysis routines) may be installed freely on alternate Gate-
way management nodes in addition to the load host. A PAK is not nec-
essary to install or execute the management utilities.

This software is furnished under the licensing provision of Digital
Equipment Corporation's Standard Terms and Conditions. For more in-
formation about DIGITAL's licensing terms and policies, contact your
local DIGITAL representative.

License Management Facility Support

SOFTWARE PRODUCT SERVICES

Domain Gateway Orientation/Installation Service

The Domain Gateway Orientation/Installation Service is SUGGESTED in
conjunction with the customer's first purchase of a DIGITAL SNA Domain
Gateway if the installation is to be warranted and supported by
DIGITAL. (Note: An Upgrade Service is available if you upgrade from
a DIGITAL SNA Gateway for Channel Transport or DIGITAL SNA Gateway for
Synchronous Transport to the Domain Gateway.) The purpose of this 
service is to ensure that the installation of the Domain Gateway is 
complete and that start-up problems are eliminated. It includes the 
following activities:

o  Verify IBM and DIGITAL hardware and software prerequisites.

o  Coordinate customer MIS and DIGITAL Software Services resources.

o  Review IBM system generation parameters.

o  Install the Domain Gateway and any load host resident OpenVMS Gate-
   way access routine software that has been ordered concurrently with
   the Domain Gateway for the first load host.

o  Verify connectivity between installed access routines and the IBM
   system if they have been preconfigured according to the guidelines
   provided by DIGITAL for those products. The following access rou-
   tines qualify for this verification:

   -  DIGITAL SNA 3270 Terminal Emulator for OpenVMS

   -  DIGITAL SNA Printer Emulator for OpenVMS

   -  DIGITAL SNA Remote Job Entry for OpenVMS

   -  DIGITAL SNA Data Transfer Facility for OpenVMS

   -  DIGITAL SNA 3270 Application Services

                                21

 

   -  MEP VT for DIGITAL SNA 3270 Application Services

Connectivity verification of the Domain Gateway with access routine
products, other than those listed above, will be done using the 
Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) supplied with each access 
routine.

An installation service is available for the simultaneous installa-
tion of the access routines on additional Alpha, VAX, or Windows 
systems.

DIGITAL will provide these services upon customer notification that
the system, including all prerequisite hardware and software, is ready
for installation according to the guidelines listed in the Customer
Responsibilities section of this Software Product Description. Contact
your local DIGITAL representative for additional information on these
services.
