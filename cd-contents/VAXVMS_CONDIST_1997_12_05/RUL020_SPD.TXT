PRODUCT NAME:  RuleWorks[TM] Version 2.0              SPD 64.31.**

DESCRIPTION

RuleWorks[TM] is Digital's next generation rule-based, application de-
velopment tool. It provides the convenience of cross-platform devel-
opment combined with one of the industry's most powerful high level
languages and fastest inference engines.

RuleWorks[TM] is a language, compiler (with debugger), and Run-Time
Library for constructing high performance, modular, object-oriented,
forward-chaining, rule-based applications. It provides portability by
producing ANSI C sources that can then be compiled with any of the lead-
ing C or C++ compilers. There is a Run-Time Library for each supported
platform and C compiler.

Rule-based approaches have been successful in numerous applications
in the manufacturing industries and wherever decision support or rapid
prototyping is required. Other domains include configuration, selec-
tion, data acquisition and process control. Health care firms and oth-
ers who require interactive diagnostic programs have also used expert
systems to great advantage.

A rule (or production) is defined as an "if-then" or "when- do" state-
ment consisting of a conditional part, called the Left Hand Side (LHS),
and an action sequence, called the Right Hand Side (RHS). Rules op-
erate on in-memory objects that represent concepts or entities in the
real world. These objects, called Working Memory Objects, are composed
of a set of attributes and their associated values.

                                                     November, 1995

 

During each recognize-act cycle, RuleWorks[TM] examines the LHS of all
active rules to determine which rules' LHS conditions are satisfied
given the current state of Working Memory Objects. RuleWorks[TM] then
applies conflict resolution criteria to determine which of these rules
should have its action sequence executed. Actions in turn, can mod-
ify the state of Working Memory Objects. This cycle is repeated un-
til no more rules are satisfied or until a rule explicitly halts pro-
cessing.

A rule-based language differs from a conventional programming language
in that rules are not processed in sequential order; rather, the or-
der of execution is driven by the current state of working memory data.

RuleWorks[TM] is an evolutionary step beyond its predecessor, DEC OPS5
V4.0. Most applications written in DEC OPS5 V4.0 are trivial to mi-
grate to RuleWorks[TM].

Portability

The RuleWorks[TM] compiler and the run-time systems are written in ANSI
C and the compiler generates ANSI C output files. RuleWorks[TM] is cur-
rently supported on the following platforms:

Modularity

RuleWorks[TM] provides features that are designed to support the soft-
ware engineering concepts of modularity and information hiding. For
example the programmer can write multiple independent rule-based sub-
systems that do not interfere with each other. It is also possible for
multiple rule-based subsystems to share specific sets of information
with each other, or to share all of the information to which each has
access. Programmers can also control all of the functional and all of
the matchable information subsystem interfaces.

Rule-based subsystems can be called from other rule- based programs
or from programs written in other languages. From a rule-based mod-
ule, calls can be made to any other subprogram (including those which
are rule- based), even recursively. Function arguments are passed via
standard calling mechanisms with automatic data type coercions.

Match Extensions

The LHS is the "if" or "when" part of a rule. It specifies the con-
ditions in working memory that must be true before the rule can ex-
ecute. The LHS is composed of condition elements (CEs), each of which
can match objects of a particular class, and its subclasses, if any.
RuleWorks[TM] performs a logical AND operation on all the CEs on the
LHS. A rule is eligible to execute when there are objects that match
all of its positive CEs, but there are no objects that match any of
its negative CEs. The RHS is the "then/do" part of a rule. It consists
of one or more actions. The actions on the RHS of a rule are executed
only when the LHS matches working memory and the resulting particu-
lar instance is picked during conflict resolution.

RuleWorks[TM] provides the following new matching features:

o  Variables are evaluated within value disjunctions, including vari-
   ables bound in other condition elements.

o  Relational predicates (>, <, >=, =) can compare integers to floats,
   and symbols with symbols using localizable lexicographic ordering.


                                 3

 

o  New similarity predicate, ~=, that for numbers tests for equality
   within a 1% margin, and that for symbols uses the SOUNDEX algorithm
   to compare phonetic (in English) similarity.

o  New dissimilarity predicate, -~=, that matches when the similar-
   ity test fails.

o  Comparisons of compound attributes against function return values.

o  The containment and non-containment predicates can be applied to
   scalar attributes, as long as the argument to the predicate is a
   compound value (e.g. ^name [+] <name-list>).

o  The containment predicate can also be applied in conjunction with
   a scalar predicate to search the compound attribute for a value that
   satisfies the scalar predicate.

Applications

RuleWorks[TM] is the preferred tool for developing high- performance,
commercial quality rule-based systems. Systems developed with Rule-
Works[TM] are well suited to solve problems in:

o  Configuration

o  Selection

o  Diagnosis

o  Process monitoring and control

o  Scheduling

o  Planning

o  Decision support

o  Rapid prototyping

Applications involving these problems are found in such industries as
discrete manufacturing, petrochemicals, banking, insurance, transporta-
tion, aerospace, education, health care, and government.

 Features

o  Support for an object-oriented data model with a single inheritance
   class hierarchy, with matching at arbitrary levels in the hierar-
   chy, and unique immutable instance identifiers

o  Support for multi-valued, or compound, attributes. Provides match
   primitives for comparing entire compound values, for comparing a
   specific element within a compound value, and for searching an en-
   tire compound value for some specific value.

o  Optional attribute data types allow the user to restrict the do-
   main of an attribute to a specific type of value (or values in the
   case of a compound attribute).

o  Built-in support for SQL access to RdB for OpenVMS databases. This
   includes a simple one- to-one mapping between tuples in the database
   and the corresponding matchable objects, as well as support for ar-
   bitrarily complex mappings

o  API allows the direct creation, modification, and deletion of ob-
   jects in working memory

Application Development Process

Developing applications for any supported platform is straightforward:

o  Applications (including client server, object oriented programs)
   are composed in ASCII text using any suitable editor and the Rule-
   Works[TM] language.

o  The RuleWorks[TM] compiler is called, either independently from the
   system prompt or from within another development environment such
   as Visual C++, and utilizes the ASCII source as its input.

o  The RuleWorks[TM] compiler produces ANSI C source code portable to
   the platform in which the application will ultimately be run.



                                 5

 

o  The RuleWorks[TM] produced C code is compiled and linked with the
   RuleWorks[TM] run-time library utilizing the target platform C com-
   piler. Note that this compiler could be the very same as was in use
   in the environment from which RuleWorks[TM] was called. For exam-
   ple the RuleWorks[TM] produced C can be compiled simultaneously with
   the Visual C++ sources.

o  The resulting object code will execute on the platform correspond-
   ing to the C compiler utilized.

o  Programs produced with RuleWorks[TM] can be created in modules which
   can be individually tested, debugged and used with new applications
   as required.

Compiler

RuleWorks[TM] achieves high performance through a compiled language
implementation, and utilizes a variant of the Rete match algorithm to
represent the interdependencies of rules and data in a highly effi-
cient way.

The Rete network greatly speeds up the pattern-matching (inference)
operation by eliminating the need for exhaustive redundant tests at
execution time.

SQL Interface

RuleWorks[TM] provides a built-in interface to SQL (Structured Query
Language) that allows users to easily read data from an OpenVMS Rdb
into RuleWorks[TM] working memory, and values from working memory into
an OpenVMS Rdb. The SQL interface consists of a set of RHS actions that
allow fetch, insert, and update operations with either a simple, one-
to-one mapping between object class names and database table names,
and a corresponding one-to-one mapping between objects and tuples, or
a more flexible form which supports arbitrary mappings.





                                 6

 

Run-Time System

The RuleWorks[TM] run-time system includes a command interpreter that
lets the user control the running of RuleWorks[TM] programs and is-
sue debugging commands.

The RuleWorks[TM] debugging commands can be used to find errors in the
program and to interact with it while it is running. The DEBUG action
and the DEBUG qualifier together allow the user to control the invo-
cation of the RuleWorks[TM] command interpreter with no changes to the
source code. If your program calls routines written in another lan-
guage, you use that language's debugger to find errors in those rou-
tines.

The RuleWorks[TM] run-time system also provides an application pro-
gramming interface for use from other languages.
