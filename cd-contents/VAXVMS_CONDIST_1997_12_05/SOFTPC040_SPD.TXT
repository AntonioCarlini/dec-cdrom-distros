 PRODUCT NAME: DEC SoftPC for OpenVMS, Version 4.0   SPD 32.18.02

 DESCRIPTION

 DEC SoftPC for OpenVMS provides the user the with ability to operate
 DOS-based software. The SoftPC[R] product emulates an IBM[R] PC/AT[R]
 system (both real and protected mode) using standard hardware and soft-
 ware. A DOS application functions in the SoftPC environment as it func-
 tions on an IBM PC/AT providing it does not require special hardware
 or copy protected diskette.

 DEC SoftPC supports MOTIF, as well as the VT220. As such, it can be
 executed on an OpenVMS system and can be displayed on a VT220 or a lo-
 cal or remote MOTIF display station using LK201 or LK401 keyboards.

 The performance of the SoftPC facility is dependent upon a number of
 factors as well as the speed of the processor upon which it executes.
 A VAXstation 4000/90 will deliver compute performance in the 386 range.
 Graphics performance will be slower.

 Applications used with SoftPC (except those DOS utilities included with
 the SoftPC software) are not Digital licensed, warranted or supported
 products. The user must comply with the terms and conditions of each
 application software license agreement in effect between the user and
 application supplier.

 Communications applications may not operate in a like manner to a real
 PC due to differences in signalling on the host processor and the PC
 processor and the way in which the host processor handles interrupts.
 Many communications programs do work correctly and it is recommended
 these programs be tried before purchasing SoftPC.
