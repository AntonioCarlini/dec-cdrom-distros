 PRODUCT NAME:  DECnet SNA Gateway for                  SPD 25.C6.04
                Synchronous Transport, Version 1.2A

 DESCRIPTION

 DECnet SNA Gateway for Synchronous Transport (DECnet SNA Gateway-ST)
 is a member of the DECnet SNA Gateway product family. This family con-
 sists of hardware and software products that allow users to exchange
 information and share resources bidirectionally between suitably con-
 figured Digital systems in a DECnet environment and IBM[R] systems in
 a Systems Network Architecture (SNA) environment.

 Users on one or more Digital systems can simultaneously perform func-
 tions such as accessing IBM application programs or other system re-
 sources, act as a 3270 display station, perform data transfer between
 Digital and IBM file systems, exchange electronic documents and mail
 messages, submit jobs to IBM batch subsystems acting as a Remote Job
 Entry workstation, and implement distributed, task-to-task applica-
 tion programs that run between Digital and IBM systems.

 The DECnet SNA product set provides a system connecting DECnet and SNA
 networks which can be used by a wide variety of Digital-supplied ac-
 cess routines running under OpenVMS, MS-DOS[R], and ULTRIX operating
 environments. DECnet SNA Gateway-ST is managed and configured using
 the gateway management software that is part of DECnet SNA Gateway-
 ST. For additional information on the various access routines and their

 capabilities, consult the OPTIONAL SOFTWARE section of the System Sup-
 port Addendum (SSA 25.C6.04-x).

 DECnet SNA Gateway-ST works in conjunction with either of the DEC Mi-
 croServer hardware platforms. The DEC MicroServer (DEMSA-S*) provides
 connectivity for up to four synchronous lines and the DEC MicroServer-
 SP (DEMSB-S*) provides a single synchronous line connection. (For pur-
 poses of this document, the term "DEC MicroServer" is used to refer
 to either hardware device, unless specifically stated otherwise.)

 DECnet SNA Gateway-ST is part of both the DECnet and the SNA networks.
 Architecturally, it is a DECnet Phase IV end node to DECnet and a Phys-
 ical Unit Type 2.0 to SNA. Its purpose is to provide bidirectional net-
 work access between DECnet and SNA networks. The DEC MicroServer pro-
 vides physical connectivity to an Ethernet local area network (LAN)
 and, when used in conjunction with DECnet SNA Gateway-ST software, it
 provides SNA connectivity to any Phase IV (or Phase IV+) DECnet sys-
 tem in the DECnet network.

 This product can be used in networks currently using other DECnet SNA
 Gateway systems and can share access routines, Ethernet LANs, and load
 host resources with those systems.

 The DECnet SNA Gateway-ST software is downline loaded into the DEC Mi-
 croServer. The gateway management software, which is part of the DEC-
 net SNA Gateway-ST, is required for the OpenVMS or ULTRIX node des-
 ignated as the load host for DECnet SNA Gateway-ST. Other DECnet sys-
 tems wishing access to the SNA network through the DEC MicroServer should
 be configured with the appropriate DECnet SNA access routines.

 DECnet SNA Gateway-ST V1.2 supports SNA synchronous communications us-
 ing the SDLC protocol. The number of links supported depends on the
 hardware unit being used (DEC MicroServer or DEC MicroServer-SP), line
 speeds required by the customer, and the electrical interface used.
 Table 1 shows the configuration matrix for connecting to the SNA net-
 work.

 Loading DECnet SNA Gateway-ST Software

 The DEC MicroServer requires software to be loaded into memory prior
 to DECnet SNA Gateway operation. DECnet SNA Gateway-ST software is down-
 line loaded across the Ethernet LAN from an OpenVMS or ULTRIX system
 acting as a DECnet load host system.

 Most AXP, VAX, MicroVAX, VAXstation, VAXserver, DECsystem, and DEC-
 station systems running OpenVMS or ULTRIX are supported as Ethernet
 load hosts for DECnet SNA Gateway-ST. Supported OpenVMS or ULTRIX load
 host configurations are described in the System Support Addendum (SSA
 25.C6.04-x).

 DECnet SNA Gateway Management

                                  3

 

 DECnet SNA gateway management software, which is included in the DEC-
 net SNA Gateway-ST package, provides configuration and management func-
 tions for use with the DECnet SNA Gateway for Synchronous Transport
 V1.2. The gateway management features allow the gateway administra-
 tor to configure the software executing in the DECnet SNA Gateway-ST
 system. It also allows the administrator to set up parameters relat-
 ing to lines, circuits, physical units, logical units, and other key
 variables necessary for network-to-network communications between the
 DECnet and SNA networks. Additionally, it allows the administrator to
 manage and diagnose problems related to the DECnet SNA Gateway-ST.

 DECnet SNA gateway management software is required on the OpenVMS or
 ULTRIX load host and is used to support the DECnet SNA Gateway-ST. It
 must also be present on any other OpenVMS or ULTRIX node whose users
 want to manage DECnet SNA Gateway-ST and the DEC MicroServer. It is
 strongly recommended that the management software also be installed
 on OpenVMS or ULTRIX systems in order to facilitate application de-
 bugging functions where IBM Interconnect application programs are de-
 veloped using the DECnet SNA Programming Interface products.

 Gateway management software includes DECnet style network management
 tools for configuring, controlling, monitoring, and troubleshooting
 the DECnet SNA Gateway-ST product. These activities are generally per-
 formed by the Digital system manager responsible for the designated
 load host node. Most management functions are performed from a node
 on the Digital network rather than at or on the Gateway itself.

 Management of DECnet SNA Gateway-ST should be viewed as part of the
 Digital environment while the management of the synchronous circuits
 connecting the DECnet SNA Gateway to the IBM network is a joint re-
 sponsibility of the IBM and Digital system managers. (Refer to the Cus-
 tomer Responsibilities section of this Software Product Description.)

 DECnet SNA gateway management software allows a Digital system oper-
 ator to bootstrap or restart a DECnet SNA Gateway remotely and pro-
 vide configuration and initialization facilities for the DECnet SNA
 Gateway.

 Problem Isolation and Determination Tools for the Gateway

                                  4

 

 In addition to event logging and error counters, a wide range of fault
 isolation tools are included.

 Trace capabilities, snatrace for ULTRIX and SNATRACE and NETTRACE for
 OpenVMS, are provided for use with the DECnet SNA Gateway-ST to help
 debug application programs as well as assist in identifying system prob-
 lems. An operator can run a trace at the Circuit, Physical Unit (PU),
 or Session level, and then format the data on a specified Digital sys-
 tem. The trace features are helpful in identifying an error for re-
 medial action.

 A snapshot monitoring utility is provided to display on a Digital host-
 controlled terminal the status of the Gateway's buffer availability,
 the number of SNA sessions currently in progress, and other informa-
 tion that pertains to both the DECnet and SNA network.

 If an irrecoverable error should occur during operation of the DEC-
 net SNA Gateway system, a memory image may be dumped to a designated
 Ethernet-attached AXP, VAX, or RISC host. This memory image may then
 be provided to your Digital support personnel for problem diagnosis.

 Features

 o  NRZI support - Signaling mode for the line(s) from the Gateway to
    the IBM system can be set to NORMAL or NRZI (non-return-to-zero-
    inverted) so that line characteristics match those set in the IBM
    ACF/NCP LINE macro.

 o  Support for FULL duplex transmission - Circuits can be set FULL du-
    plex to allow data to be sent and received simultaneously on full
    duplex lines. This setting corresponds to DATMODE=FULL in the IBM
    ACF/NCP PU macro.

 o  Support for RECFMS - The Gateway can send Record Formatted Main-
    tenance Statistics (RECFMS) messages to the IBM system. These mes-
    sages contain counters requested by the IBM Network Problem Deter-
    mination Application (NPDA) using Request Maintenance Statistics
    (REQMS) messages. Not all RECFMS messages are supported by the Gate-
    way. Refer to the DECnet SNA Gateway-CT and -ST Management user doc-
    umentation for more information.

 o  A simplified configuration procedure - After installing Gateway-
    ST gateway management software, a single configuration procedure
    is run which creates command procedures that define items for the
    DECnet database on the load host, and the SNA and DECnet databases
    on the Gateway.

 o  Extended SDLC - Support for Extended Response Mode SDLC (Modulo 128).

 When Using DEC MicroServer Hardware

 o  Synchronous line support - DECnet SNA Gateway-ST supports up to four
    SDLC connections at speeds of 64Kbs/circuit or less, two connec-
    tions at 128Kbs/circuit, or a single connection at 256Kbs.

 o  Session support - DECnet SNA Gateway-ST supports up to 128 concur-
    rent (Logical Unit) sessions for selected access routines.

 When Using DEC MicroServer-SP Hardware

 o  Synchronous line support - DECnet SNA Gateway-ST supports one SDLC
    connection at up to 19.2Kbps.

                                  6

 

 o  Session support - DECnet SNA Gateway-ST supports up to 32 concur-
    rent (Logical Unit) sessions for selected access routines.
