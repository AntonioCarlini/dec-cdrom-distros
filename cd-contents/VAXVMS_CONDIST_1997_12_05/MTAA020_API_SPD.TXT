 Product Name:  MAILbus 400 Application Program Interface        SPD
 42.80.05                for OpenVMS VAX, Version 2.0A

 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

 MAILbus 400[TM] Application Program Interface (API) for OpenVMS[TM]
 VAX[TM] is a layered software product that resides on an OpenVMS VAX
 system. It provides a programming interface that gives application de-
 velopment programmers access to the messaging services provided by the
 MAILbus 400 Message Transfer Agent.

 MAILbus 400 API for OpenVMS provides a C language interface to the MAIL-
 bus 400 MTA's messaging services. An ANSI C conformant compiler is re-
 quired to use the MAILbus 400 API.

 A MAILbus 400 Application Program Interface license is required for
 application development only. An application built using MAILbus 400
 Application Program Interface can be operated without the need for a
 MAILbus 400 Application Program Interface license.

 MAILbus 400 API can operate either colocated with MAILbus 400 MTA or
 on a remote OpenVMS VAX machine.

 CONFORMANCE TO STANDARDS

 MAILbus 400 API is an implementation of the X/Open[TM] CAE Specifi-
 cation - OSI-Abstract-Data-Manipulation (November 1991 edition), and
 the X/Open CAE Specification - API to Electronic Mail (November 1991
 edition). These specifications define a vendor-independent program-
 ming interface to X.400 messaging services. However, applications linked

 with the MAILbus 400 API can only communicate directly with the MAIL-
 bus 400 MTA. MAILbus 400 API provides both the Application and Gate-
 way interfaces defined by the X/Open CAE Specifications.

 MAILbus 400 API does not support the Retrieval Functional Unit of the
 X/Open CAE Specification - API to Electronic Mail.

 Processors Supported

 Any OpenVMS VAX configuration supported by
 DECnet[TM]-Plus for OpenVMS VAX, with the exception of those listed
 below. See the DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS VAX Software Product Descrip-
 tion (25.03.*) for further information on supported hardware config-
 urations.

 Processors Not Supported

 8000

 Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1):

 Disk space required for    3500 blocks
 installation:

 Disk space required for    3100 blocks
 use (permanent):

 These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
 sizes are approximate. Actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
 system environment, configuration, and software options.

 CLUSTER ENVIRONMENT

 This layered product may be installed on each node in any valid and
 licensed VMScluster[TM] configuration. Each node of a VMScluster can
 run one instance of MAILbus 400 API. Each API is independent and does
 not share workspace and operates as it would on an individual system.
