 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC @aGlance for VMS, Version 1.0       SPD 39.97.00

 DESCRIPTION

 DEC @aGlance for VMS enables integration between "clients" such as pop-
 ular desktop applications (for example, spreadsheets, and statisti-
 cal packages) and other high level manufacturing applications (for ex-
 ample, Plant Floor Management Systems) with "servers" (for example,
 manufacturing control systems) across multi-vendor platforms via an
 open client-server architecture.

 The information exchange between DEC @aGlance servers and clients pro-
 vides interactive access to manufacturing data for analysis and in-
 vestigations. The DEC @aGlance for VMS Development Option is used by
 software developers to provide this enabler for their VMS software ap-
 plications. The Runtime Options provide end-users with a license to
 use the @aGlance servers or clients which have been developed for the
 applications in their manufacturing enterprise.

 Development Option

 The DEC @aGlance for VMS Development Option allows application devel-
 opers or system integrators to compile and link a DEC @aGlance client
 and/or server enabler with their application. This provides the means
 for their application to access manufacturing data with available @aGlance
 servers, and /or the means for their application to provide manufac-
 turing data to @aGlance clients.

 Server Runtime Option

 The DEC @aGlance for VMS Server Runtime Option allows users to run a
 previously developed DEC @aGlance server on a target machine. Program
 development is not supported under the Runtime Only Option.

 Client Runtime Option

 The DEC @aGlance for VMS Client Runtime Option allows users to run a
 previously developed DEC @aGlance client on a target machine. Program
 development is not supported under the Runtime Only Option. Features

 The DEC @aGlance for VMS Development Options provide both a data model
 and a service model for the interchange of manufacturing data. Appli-
 cation developers or system integrators use the development toolkits'
 Application Programming Interface (API) to provide the ability for clients
 to query servers for information and status. The binding between clients
 and services is performed transparently for both the developer and the
 end user.

 The data model is oriented towards referencing manufacturing data by
 process tagnames and their attributes. This is a table representation
 whereby a single process tagname (such as "TANK_1") may have one or
 more associated attributes (such as "PRESENT_VALUE", "RANGE_HI", etc.).

 The data model supports the following data types associated with tag-
 name/attribute pairs :

 o  Integers

 o  Reals

 o  Booleans

 o  Strings

 The service model provides the kinds of requests a DEC @aGlance client
 can invoke from a DEC @aGlance server. The following services are sup-
 ported :

 o  Get Data

 o  Put Data

 o  Get Tagnames

 o  Get Attributes

 o  Get History

                                  2

 

 o  Put History

 o  Monitoring - Provides a server with an interest list of tagname/attribute
    pairs. When the server recognizes that a tagname/attribute pair changes
    state or value, the server will notify the client of the change of
    state or value, and pass the new state or value.

 o  Command - Provides a private messaging command between cooperat-
    ing client and servers.

 The Development Options include C source code examples of a sample @aGlance
 client and an @aGlance server. Developers may use the examples as tem-
 plates from which to build their actual @aGlance client or server.
