 

 This SPD describes DECnet SNA Application Programming Interface for
 OpenVMS, which is available for the OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS AXP plat-
 forms. All information applies to both platforms unless otherwise in-
 dicated.

 DESCRIPTION

 The DECnet SNA Application Programming Interface for OpenVMS (API) is
 a layered software product that allows user-written applications run-
 ning on suitably configured OpenVMS systems running DECnet or VMS/SNA
 software to exchange information with cooperating applications on an
 IBM host. The API software exists in the OpenVMS system as a share-
 able image. Access between the cooperating Digital and IBM applica-
 tions is via one of the following products:

 o  DECnet SNA Gateway for Synchronous Transport

 o  DECnet SNA Gateway for Channel Transport

 o  DEC SNA Domain Gateway for Channel Transport

 o  VMS/SNA - an OpenVMS VAX layered product that supports users on the
    system where VMS/SNA is running

 Features

 The DECnet SNA Application Programming Interface for OpenVMS (API) is
 a collection of subroutines designed to provide an easy-to-use inter-
 face for the OpenVMS application programmer who has a specific need
 to interface to an IBM application subsystem. It supports many dif-
 ferent types of sessions between OpenVMS applications and applica-
 tions running in an IBM host. DIGITAL August 1993 AE-EV67F-TE

 API implements all of the path control layer, and portions of the trans-
 mission and data flow control layers of SNA. The interface supports
 a number of different applications, each of which uses the SNA func-
 tion management, data flow control, and transmission control layers
 in a different way. API is not limited to supporting a particular ap-
 plication, such as 3270 terminals or RJE workstations; the supported

 session types are Logical Unit Types 0, 1, 2, and 3, using the FM and
 TS profile types 3 and 4, as described in the product documentation.

 API provides extensive parameter checking, state machine management,
 and other high level services, relieving the OpenVMS application pro-
 grammer of tedious protocol details such as state machine process-
 ing or "standard" SNA message format checking. The interface appears
 to the OpenVMS application as a set of subroutines that it calls to
 re- quest the following operations:

 o  Establish an SNA session with an application running on an IBM host

 o  Respond to a session request initiated by an IBM application

 o  Re-establish a session if the connection is broken

 o  Disconnect from a session

 o  Receive messages from an IBM host on the normal or expedited flow

 o  Send messages to an IBM host on the normal or expedited flow

 o  Provide positive or negative responses to messages transmitted from
    an IBM host

 Asynchronous Event Notification

 API provides a mechanism for an OpenVMS user application to receive
 control when an asynchronous "network event" occurs such as the dis-
 connection of a DECnet logical link, an SNA circuit failure, or the
 receipt of an Unbind Type 2 from IBM. The OpenVMS application is called
 at a notification entry point defined by the application at connec-
 tion time; an indication of the event that occurred is reported.

 SNA Functions

 API provides OpenVMS applications with access to the SNA functions per-
 formed by either an SNA gateway or VMS/SNA software. These include
 SNA path control functions, data link control functions, and upper-
 level functions such as checking access information. API provides as-
 sistance with some functions such as brackets and chaining. In addi-
 tion, API supports negotiable binds and handles exception responses

                                  2

 

 for the user application. For complete details about which SNA func-
 tions are pro- vided by this product, refer to the product documen-
 tation.

 The application must provide the remaining SNA functions it requires.
 For example, the application must be designed to:

 o  Process all FMD layer protocols

 o  Take into account all data flow control and session control request
    /response units

 o  Keep track of any "states" relevant to the application

 o  Translate between ASCII and EBCDIC and vice versa

 o  Parse the bind request

 o  Respond to request units

 Basic and Extended Modes

 The DECnet SNA Application Programming Interface for OpenVMS (Version
 2.3) can be used in either basic or extended mode (it cannot be used
 in both modes simultaneously). In basic mode, OpenVMS applications writ-
 ten for the Version 1.x product are compatible with the new version,
 provided that they ran successfully with the earlier version.

 Extended mode subroutines are layered on the basic mode subroutines,
 providing OpenVMS programmers with an easier-to-use interface to the
 SNA environment. Some additional services the extended mode provides
 for the OpenVMS programmer include chaining, state machine checking,
 building request and response headers, and implementing the transmis-
 sion control and data flow control of SNA sessions for the user. For
 additional details of the two modes of operation, refer to the prod-
 uct documentation.

 User Interface


                                  3

 

 Users of API should be experienced OpenVMS application programmers.
 They can use any of the OpenVMS programming languages which conform
 to the OpenVMS Calling Standard to create application programs which
 interact with application programs on an IBM system. The user docu-
 mentation provides example programs written in the following languages:

 o  MACRO-32

 o  C

 o  COBOL

 o  FORTRAN

 o  PASCAL

 o  PL/I

 Users of this product should be familiar with SNA and have some knowl-
 edge of the type of logical unit that will be used.

 Source Code

 Sources of message files are available only for translation to lan-
 guages other than English. Source Code will not be distributed for gen-
 eral purposes.

 INSTALLATION

 Only experienced customers should attempt installation of this prod-
 uct. Digital recommends that all other customers purchase Digital's
 Installation Services. These services provide for installation of the
 software product by an experienced Digital Software Specialist.

 Customer Responsibilities

 Before Digital installation of the software the customer must:

 o  Have previously installed all requisite hardware including termi-
    nals and SNA gateway products.

                                  4

 

 o  Obtain, install, and demonstrate as operational any modems and other
    equipment and facilities necessary to interface to Digital's com-
    munications equipment.

 o  Have generated, to Digital's satisfaction, any necessary IBM host
    software that will be communicating with the SNA gateway or VMS/SNA
    and the Application Programming Interface product.

 o  Make available for a reasonable period of time, as mutually agreed
    by Digital and the customer, all hardware, communications facil-
    ities, and terminals that are to be used during installation.

 Delays caused by any failure to meet these responsibilities will be
 charged at the prevailing rate for time and materials.

 Successful use of this product requires that:

 o  The customer must be prepared to work with both Digital and IBM sys-
    tems personnel to coordinate the pre-installation activities.

 o  The customer should be capable of modifying IBM component gener-
    ation parameters to support either the SNA gateway or VMS/SNA and
    the Application Programming Interface software.
