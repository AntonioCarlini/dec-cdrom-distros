 PRODUCT NAME:  MEP VT for DEC SNA 3270                 SPD 44.00.02
                Application Services, Version 3.0

 DESCRIPTION

 MEP VT for DEC SNA 3270 Application Services is an OpenVMS terminal
 emulation software package that enables users on SNA networked IBM[R]
 3270 terminals and PCs emulating 3270 terminals, to interactively ac-
 cess unmodified applications on OpenVMS systems.

 The MEP VT software has the following features:

 o  Supports full screen VT220 terminal emulation on IBM 3270 class ter-
    minals

 o  Supports DECforms applications that include a 3270 terminal lay-
    out

 o  Supports access to OpenVMS AXP and DEC OSF/1[R] systems through an
    OpenVMS VAX system running MEP VT

 o  Customizable keyboard layout

 o  Customizable video attribute conversion

 o  Customizable remote port information. On unit base, item fields can
    be disabled or enabled and the separator is selectable.

 o  Customizable answer string information. On unit base, item fields
    from the remote port information can be disabled or enabled to ap-
    pear inside the answer string and the separator is selectable.

 o  Image dependent setup feature. This feature allows optimal adap-
    tation of MEP VT setup parameters, depending which image the MEP
    VT user is currently running.

                               DIGITAL                    April 1994

                                                         AE-PT61D-TE

 

 o  Echo list suppress feature. The user may maintain as list of key-
    words behind or below them input fields are never echoed. Proper
    usage of this feature inhibits any password displayed, even if the
    application would display it.

 o  Extended keyboard definition language. This feature allows concate-
    nation of more than one VT220 function to one <<HOST>> function key.
    The keyboard help can show symbolic application dependent key names
    instead of the native VT220 function key names. This allows coun-
    try specific customization of keyboard names.

 o  The minimum input field size can be increased up to 1920 bytes.

 o  Includes a variety of multinational character sets (code pages)

 o  Provides a Setup capability for dynamically customizing MEP VT to
    the OpenVMS application

 o  Full support for applications that use 80 to 132 columns. On 80 col-
    umn IBM terminals 132 column emulation is provided via a horizon-
    tal shift feature

 o  Input and output optimization

 o  Variable scrolling window

 o  GOTO and JUMPTO functions for efficient cursor positioning while
    editing

 o  Supports a wide variety of unmodified OpenVMS applications includ-
    ing ALL-IN-1, EDT, TPU, WPS-PLUS, and PHONE

 o  All VT220 control sequences are supported except those listed in
    the Restrictions section.

 o  Support for OpenVMS Command Line Edit functions such as Command Re-
    call

 MEP VT requires the DEC SNA Domain Gateway product (SPD 38.69.xx) and
 DEC SNA 3270 Application Services - Runtime System (SPD 38.70.xx).

                                  2

 

 The Domain Gateway and 3270 Application Services products provide con-
 nectivity between the OpenVMS system in a DECnet network and the IBM
 systems and terminals in an SNA network. This configuration supports
 a maximum number of 1,020 concurrent sessions.

 Emulation is implemented entirely on the OpenVMS system, requiring no
 IBM host resident software. This results in a minimal CPU load on the
 IBM system.

 Keyboard Layout Definition

 Keyboard definitions can be customized for specific applications, users,
 or terminal type. Keys can be assigned by the user dynamically through
 the Define_Key command, through MEP VT Define_Key commands in a com-
 mand file, or by selecting an alternative text or binary keyboard def-
 inition file on the SETUP menu.

 Keys can be assigned to emulate VT function keys, keypad keys, or to
 strings that can contain VMS commands, for example "set default."

 A keyboard Normal, Upshifted, and Downshifted function permits each
 IBM function key to be defined with up to three separate VT functions.
 This permits the definition of as many as 72 VT functions with the 24
 standard IBM function keys.

 Support for DECforms Applications

 DECforms applications can be run in VT emulation mode just like any
 other OpenVMS application. For improved usability and higher perfor-
 mance DECforms applications that have been modified to include a 3270
 layout can be run from a MEP VT terminal session. DECforms applica-
 tions with 3270 layouts can fully utilize the local editing and full
 screen navigating features of the local 3174 cluster controller. DEC-
 forms applications that are run in VT emulation mode require the co-
 operation of the MEP VT software for inter field screen navigation.

 Access to systems other than OpenVMS VAX systems

 A MEP VT user logged into an OpenVMS VAX system that has MEP VT in-
 stalled can access other systems, including OpenVMS AXP and DEC OSF
 /1 systems, by issuing the SET HOST or TELNET command. Through the use
 of the Auto-Login Facility (ALF) and a captive command procedure, that
 includes the SET HOST or TELNET command, a user need not be aware that
 he is passing through an OpenVMS VAX system.

 Support for CTRL- and Gold- Key Functions

 A Reverse Order key definition and "Make CTRL" key allows CTRL- and
 Gold- key functions to be emulated with a minimum of keystrokes. CTRL-
 W, for example, can be emulated by hitting the "W" and "Make CTRL"
 keys.

 HELP and SETUP

 A standard HELP key displays the currently defined key definitions.
 A standard SETUP key displays current setup status and permits mod-
 ification of SETUP features for specific application or user prefer-
 ences. SETUP parameters can be optimized for use with editors, forms-
 oriented applications, or other application types.

 The SETUP features can be modified interactively from the SETUP screen,
 using SETUP commands, or through a SETUP file. Current SETUP defini-
 tions can be saved to a file to be activated upon startup.

 Character Sets

 MEP supports numerous IBM code tables for ASCII multinational char-
 acter sets to EBCDIC conversion. The code tables can be customized as
 needed and activated from the SETUP menu.

 Video Attributes

 The VT video attributes, such as BLINK, BOLD, NORMAL, REVERSE, and UN-
 DERLINE, can be mapped to corresponding IBM terminal attributes and
 /or colors with the DISPLAY and REVERSE DISPLAY Setup Commands.

 Video attributes can be set interactively or saved to a file for ac-
 tivation upon startup.

 Restrictions

 o  Downloading of VT220 soft fonts is not supported.

 o  Only "3-key-stroke" VT220 Compose Sequences are supported; "2-key-
    stroke" compose sequences are not supported.

 o  The "display controls" mode of the VT220 is not supported.

 o  Control sequences which refer to the terminal printer port are not
    supported.

 INSTALLATION

 Only customers experienced with Digital's IBM interconnect product fam-
 ily should attempt installation of this product. Digital recommends
 that all other customers purchase Digital's installation services. These
 services provide installation of the software product by an experi-
 enced Digital Software Specialist.
