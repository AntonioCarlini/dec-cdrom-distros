     PRODUCT NAME:  DEC ODA Compound Document Architecture (CDA)  SPD
     32.10.00
                    Gateway for VMS, Version 1.0

     DESCRIPTION

     The DEC ODA Compound Document Architecture (CDA) Gateway pro-
     vides an extensible interchange capability between CDA and ODA.
     The product can be used in stand-alone mode or over X.400, and
     will support internationally recognized Document Application
     Profiles (DAPS) (Q111, Q112, and Q121) as defined by the Eu-
     ropean Workshop for Open Systems (EWOS). The DEC ODA Compound
     Document Architecture (CDA) Gateway, when used over X.400, pro-
     vides open systems access to and from CDA, and allows users
     to interchange CDA documents transparently in a multi-vendor
     heterogeneous environment.

     The following is a brief description of the types of documents
     that can be interchanged using this product:

     1. Documents can contain three content types:

        -  TEXT (with attributes such as bolding and underline, etc.)

        -  IMAGE Graphics (pictures)

        -  GEOMETRIC Graphics (CDA/CAM drawings and business charts)

     2. Documents can have different types of layouts:

        -  Single column or Multiple columns

        -  Single sided or Double sided pages

     3. Documents can also have the following features:

        -  Page Numbering, e.g. Page 1

        -  Title Numbering, e.g. Chapter 1

        -  Headers and Footers

        -  Footnotes

     Restrictions

     For X.400 transmission, the Message Transport System used must
     be encoded to support ODA Body parts over a CCITT X.400 service.
     Otherwise, the gateway can only be used in stand-alone mode.

     Possible Discrepancies During Conversion from ODA to CDA

     The DEC ODA Compound Document Architecture (CDA) Gateway con-
     verts, without any loss, all text, graphics, and raster image
     content in an ODA document from the ODA format to the CDA for-
     mat. However, the ODA CDA Gateway does not support the following
     features of the ODA architecture:

     Text synchroniza-     Clipping of images
     tion

     Transparency of       Frame borders
     frames

     Variable frames       Character spacing

     Possible Discrepancies During Conversion from CDA to ODA

     The DEC ODA Compound Document Architecture (CDA) Gateway con-
     verts a CDA document to the ODA format without any loss if all
     the features of the CDA document can be represented within the
     constraints specified by the DAPs supported by the ODA CDA Gate-
     way. If the CDA document contains information more complex than
     that allowed by these DAPs, this information will not be con-
     verted.
