PRODUCT NAME:  DRX11-C/VMS Driver, Version 6.0                  SPD 26.64.02


DESCRIPTION

The DRX11-C/VMS device driver provides the user with the capability to access
the DRE11-C/DRQ11-C double buffer DMA interfaces (16-bit parallel). Programs
written in MACRO-32, VAX-11 FORTRAN or VAX-11 PASCAL can communicate with the
hardware interface under the VMS Operating Systems through the $QIO System
Service. 

This version is available in Europe only.

Features

^    Supports single word transfers

^    Supports single block transfers

^    Supports multiple block transfers - The user establishes two buffers in 
     main memory and the interface switches automatically between them. The 
     contents of one buffer are processed while the other buffer is being 
     read/written. Thus data can be transferred continuously in a cyclic 
     manner.

^    Supports large buffer block transfers - The buffer size is restricted 
     only by the amount of free physical memory available.

^    Supports the use of direct or buffered datapath

^    Supports burst mode

^    Supports direction change

^    Supports reading and writing of status and function bits

^    Supports the interface reset

^    Supports special interrupt processing - If connected to attention AST, 
     user defined interrupts are handled by executing user written routines.

^    Supports QIO Interface - Provides the functionality described above 
     through direct access to the driver with the VMS System Service.  The 
     user therefore must be familiar with the QIO calling procedures.

Driver exerciser and test programs are provided to verify the correct
installation and functionality of the DRX11-C/VMS driver. 

A programming example is provided for a computer link between:

^  (Micro)VAX/VAX
^  (Micro)VAX/PDP (with DRX11-C/RSX driver, SPD 12.72.xx).
