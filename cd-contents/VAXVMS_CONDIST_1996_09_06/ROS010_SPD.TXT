     PRODUCT NAME:  DEC Remote Operation Service for VMS, Version 1.0
     SPD 32.89.00

     DESCRIPTION

     DEC Remote Operation Service (DECros) for VMS is a Digital
     Distributed Software (DDS) product based on software developed
     by MARBEN, S.A. DECros is an implementation of two Open Systems
     Interconnection (OSI) Application Service Elements (ASE), and
     the OSI Presentation Layer.

     Specifically, DECros is an implementation of the following In-
     ternational Standards Organization (ISO) Standards and Interna-
     tional Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT)
     Recommendations:

     1. Remote Operation Service Element (ROSE)-ISO IS 9072-1, and IS
        9072-2, CCITT X.219, and X.229 (1988)

     2. Association Control Service Element (ACSE)-ISO IS 8649, and
        IS 8650, CCITT X.217, and X.227 (1988)

     3. Connection Oriented Presentation Layer-ISO IS 8822, and IS
        8823, CCITT X.216, and X.226 (1988)

     In addition, DECros fully supports the Abstract Syntax Notation
     One (ASN.1) and the associated Basic Encoding Rules (BER) as
     defined by ISO (IS 8824, and 8825) and CCITT (X.208 and X.209).
     An ASN.1 cross compiler is included in the DEC Remote Operation
     Service Development Kit for VMS (SPD 32.90.xx), and should be
     used by DECros application developers.

     DECros for VMS operates over VAX OSI Applications Kernel (SPD
     27.47.xx) and can be used over ISO 8802-3 (IEEE 802.3) Lo-
     cal Area sub-networks or over X.25 communication links using
     Digital's packet-switching product range. Refer to the VAX
     P.S.I. and VAX P.S.I. Access Software Product Descriptions (SPD
     25.40.xx and SPD 27.78.xx) for more information.


     Features

     The major features of DECros are:

     o  Application Programming Interface
        An Application Programming Interface (API) providing access
        to ROSE, ACSE, and the Presentation Services is provided
        in object-code form. This API should be linked with the
        DECros user-developed code, thus providing interprocess
        communication mechanisms between the user-developed code
        and DECros.
        The DECros API includes a number of memory management rou-
        tines, transparent to the user, and is compliant with the
        memory management methods used by the ASN.1 cross-compiler
        included in the DEC Remote Operation Service Development Kit.

     o  Operator Interface
        An operator interface is provided as part of the Command
        and Management Utility (CMU). The CMU allows an operator to
        perform the following functions:

        -  Event logging (including Protocol Data Unit trace), either
           interactively on the operator console and/or captured to
           disk.

        -  Display DECros parameter values.

        -  Modify selected DECros characteristics.

     o  Installation Verification Procedures
        Utilities are provided to verify that DECros is properly
        installed and activated.

     The Remote Operation Service Element (ROSE) is defined as an
     Application Service Element (ASE) in the Application Layer (also
     known as "Layer 7") in the OSI Seven-Layer Reference Model.

     ROSE allows applications to exchange requests and responses in
     an interactive manner in a distributed open systems environment.
     ROSE is the basic OSI mechanism for interactive data communica-
     tion. Therefore, ROSE is required by X.500 Directory Services
     and the Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP).

     DECros does not support the Reliable Transfer Service Element
     (RTSE).

     Association Control Service Element

     The Association Control Service Element (ACSE) is an ASE in the
     Application Layer (also known as "Layer 7") in the OSI Seven-
     Layer Reference Model.

     ACSE provides basic facilities for establishing and controlling
     an application association between two remote applications that
     communicate by a presentation connection (Layer 6).

     Connection Oriented Presentation Layer

     The Presentation Layer is the 6th layer in the OSI Seven-Layer
     Reference Model. The Presentation Layer is concerned with the
     representation of information in transit between open systems.

     On behalf of Presentation Service Users it implements the trans-
     fer syntax negotiation function. The transformation to/from
     transfer syntax function can be implemented through the pre-
     sentation layer; however, for efficiency, the DECros user ap-
     plication is in charge of this function. The purpose of the
     presentation services follows that of the corresponding session
     services.

     SOURCE CODE

     The following source code modules are provided with binary on
     all magnetic distribution media:

     o  C code header to be included in the user-developed code to
        access the API properly.

     o  Initiator and Responder modules, in C code, to be used as
        examples of DECros access through the API.

     INSTALLATION

     Digital requires that a customer's first purchase of this soft-
     ware product include Digital Installation Services. These ser-
     vices provide for installation of the software product by an
     experienced Digital Software Specialist.

     For subsequent purchases of this product, only experienced
     customers should attempt installation. Digital recommends that
     all other customers purchase Digital's Installation Services.

     Customer Responsibilities

     Before installation of the software, the customer must:

     o  Previously have installed all requisite software and hard-
        ware, including terminals.

     o  Make available for a reasonable period of time, as mutually
        agreed by Digital and the customer, all hardware, communi-
        cation facilities, and terminals that are to be used during
        installation.

     o  For verification of installation and connectivity to another
        VAX node, designate and provide access to a DECros host that
        has previously been installed by Digital.

     Delays caused by any failure to meet these responsibilities will
     be charged at the then prevailing rate for time and materials.
