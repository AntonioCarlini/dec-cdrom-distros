Features

ACMS Desktop features are described for the following areas:

o  Development environment

o  Run-time system

o  Network support

o  Management and control

o  Documentation

o  Sample applications

Included in this product release are one or more UNSUPPORTED software
components, which are clearly identified in this Software Product De-
scription. These software components are included because they may be
useful for the user; however, they are not supported by Digital Cus-
tomer Service Centers. Inclusion of these software components does not
constitute a commitment from Digital that they will continue to be pro-
vided in this product.

Certain non-Digital (third-party) products can be used in conjunction
with this product, and are mentioned in this SPD. Third-party prod-
ucts such as those listed are not provided by this product, nor are
they directly supported by this product.

In general, Digital does not directly support any third-party prod-
ucts for use with ACMS Desktop. However, appropriate versions of cer-
tain third-party products have been tested and certified to be appro-
priate for use with this version of ACMS Desktop. The Optional Soft-
ware section of this document contains a list of these products.

Development Environment

ACMS Desktop provides a set of application programming interfaces, along
with support libraries, that allow software programs to interact with
ACMS and ACMSxp applications as authenticated clients. These inter-
faces allow programmers to write client programs without requiring ex-
tensive programming knowledge of network communications or the ACMS
or ACMSxp languages.

ACMS Desktop Clients

ACMS Desktop provides application programming interfaces for the Mi-
crosoft Windows, DOS, Windows 95, Windows NT, Macintosh, OpenVMS, Dig-
ital UNIX, SCO UNIX, and ULTRIX environments. These client services
allow the desktop programmer to develop programs that:

o  Sign in to the ACMS Desktop server for client authentication

o  Select ACMS tasks for execution under the control of the ACMS Ex-
   ecution Controller or through an ACMSxp task server

o  Respond to callbacks from the ACMS system as part of ACMS task ex-
   change steps (forms processing)

o  Sign out of the ACMS Desktop server

Native Windowing and Forms Packages

Appropriate customer-provided display software can be used on each desk-
top. For instance, HyperCard could be used with the Macintosh oper-
ating system, or Visual Basic or PowerBuilder could be used with Mi-
crosoft Windows. Any such packages must include facilities to call ob-
ject libraries that provide the ACMS Desktop client services.

Nonblocking Execution

ACMS Desktop clients support nonblocking programs. For event-driven
processing environments such as Windows, programs may be structured
to include an event-dispatching mechanism and a collection of proce-
dures that are invoked by this dispatching mechanism as a result of
an event. Ideally, these procedures are written to complete quickly
so that other events can be dispatched without delay.

                                 5

 

ACMS Desktop client services allow an application to release control
to the event-dispatching mechanism without waiting for a response from
the ACMS Desktop server. This is important where network traffic is
delayed and/or a large amount of processing is performed by the ACMS
or ACMSxp application system.

ACMS Desktop Portable Client

The portable client interface provides support for three models of ap-
plication development with the ACMS and ACMSxp for Digital UNIX TP mon-
itor:

o  Blocking interface where execution of the program is blocked dur-
   ing execution of the ACMS Desktop servers, for example, Microsoft
   COBOL on DOS.

o  Nonblocking event-driven interface to accommodate such nonblock-
   ing tools as Motif or Microsoft Windows.

o  Forced nonblocking facilities exchange I/O between ACMS tasks and
   desktop tools.

The services provided by the ACMS Desktop portable client for Microsoft
Windows, Windows 95, Windows NT, DOS, ULTRIX, Digital UNIX, SCO UNIX,
and OpenVMS address the areas of:

o  Sign in/out services-establish and terminate sessions.

o  Call processing services-send and receive application requests

o  Presentation procedure routines-are called automatically by the ACMS
   Desktop portable client to facilitate forms processing for the desk-
   top user.

DOS Memory Models and Modes

Medium and large memory models are supported for Microsoft Windows and
DOS.

For applications using Microsoft Windows, Enhanced Windows Operating
Mode is supported.

ACMS Desktop Direct Client

                                 6

 

This API provides the ACMSxp customers with DCE-based access to their
application from a Microsoft Windows system. The API consists of an
RPC style call that invokes the ACMSxp task directly, without a gate-
way server.

ACMS Desktop Client for Macintosh

This API supports the Data Access Manager (DAM) facility of the Mac-
intosh operating system. A special DAM device driver (DDEV) provides
services for client execution.

These services are synchronous; program control returns only when ser-
vice execution is complete. Nonblocking task execution is supported
because the DBExec service completes as soon as the task is submit-
ted for execution to ACMS. The DBState service is used to poll for task
completion.

Run-Time System

Desktop Client Run-Time Libraries

Run-time libraries are provided for the client operating systems to
support the execution of client programs that use the ACMS Desktop ser-
vices. The ACMS Desktop client for Microsoft Windows includes dynamic-
link libraries. (For DECnet, Microsoft Windows clients static-link li-
braries are also provided.) The ACMS Desktop client for Macintosh in-
cludes external functions for HyperCard and 4th DIMENSION applications.

ACMS Desktop Server

The ACMS Desktop server is an asynchronous, multithreaded, run-time
component residing on any OpenVMS or Digital UNIX node, regardless of
the location of ACMS or ACMSxp applications being called by desktop
clients. There is generally one ACMS Desktop server on a node. Addi-
tional ACMS Desktop servers can be executed to debug tasks. The ACMS
Desktop server is an ACMS agent or gateway into ACMS or ACMSxp that
performs the following functions:

o  Authenticates desktop clients (ACMS and/or ACMSxp submitters)

                                 7

 

o  Calls tasks for users; this can include local and remote ACMS task
   selection

o  Communicates with the desktop client program as part of task ex-
   change step (desktop presentation procedure) execution

o  Provides information to the system manager concerning ACMS Desk-
   top submitters (ACMS only)

There are no server components for Direct Client. The above functions
are provided by either Direct Client or DCE.

Network Support

The following network connectivity software is supported (see Soft-
ware Requirements) for desktop nodes connected to a Local Area Net-
work (LAN) or a Wide Area Network (WAN):

o  AppleTalk

o  DECnet

o  Dial-in (serial communication)

o  SPX/IPX

o  TCP/IP

o  X.25

Note: For OpenVMS clients, a communication module is provided for test
purposes for Novell[R] NetWare[R] but it is UNSUPPORTED. For Digital
UNIX servers, TCP/IP is the only supported network protocol.

Management and Control

Support Features



                                 8

 

The following features are provided as part of the ACMS Desktop sys-
tem and are supported in ACMS for OpenVMS and ACMSxp for Digital UNIX
environments:

o  The ACMS Desktop client services report errors from ACMS or ACM-
   Sxp back to the desktop client program for local error handling.

o  The ACMS Desktop client services optionally log error messages to
   a local desktop device file (available on Microsoft Windows, Win-
   dows NT, DOS, ULTRIX, SCO UNIX, Digital UNIX, and OpenVMS).

o  Messages can be protected against sabotage or network corruption
   by adding Cyclic Redundancy Checking (CRC).

o  The ACMS Desktop server reports ACMS and desktop client errors to
   the ACMS software event logger. The ACMS Desktop server for ACM-
   Sxp outputs error reports to a server-specific log file.

o  OpenVMS system managers can control desktop client access to ACMS
   and remove desktop clients from the ACMS system, using standard ACMS
   utilities.

Programming Services

ACMS Desktop services are provided on the server system to assist in
system management activities for ACMS for OpenVMS and ACMSxp for Dig-
ital UNIX environments.
