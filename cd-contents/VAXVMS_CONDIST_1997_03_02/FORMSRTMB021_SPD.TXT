 PRODUCT NAME:  DECforms for OpenVMS, Version 2.1       SPD 29.90.07

 DESCRIPTION

 DECforms for OpenVMS is Digital's strategic software product for the
 development and deployment of forms-based user interfaces for inter-
 active applications running on OpenVMS systems. DECforms is a complete
 user interface management system (UIMS), providing applications with
 not only the look and feel of a forms interface but also a robust set
 of dialog management and validation functions to control the user in-
 terface at application execution time.

 DECforms for OpenVMS offers application programmers a set of form de-
 velopment tools for creating forms-based user interfaces for the fol-
 lowing end-user environments:

 o  Motif®-based workstations and X terminals

 o  VT-based character-cell terminals

 o  PostScript® printers

 Tools are also included for enabling application developers to upgrade
 existing VT-based DECforms applications to take advantage of the more
 powerful bitmap displays of Motif-based desktop devices.

 DECforms is based on the ANSI/ISO standard for a Form Interface Man-
 agement System (FIMS)(ISO Standard 11730). The Form Interface Manage-
 ment System is an industry software system and is not the property of
 any company or group of companies, or of any organization or group of
 organizations. DECforms for OpenVMS offers a subset of the full func-
 tionality described by the CODASYL FIMS Journal of Development, with
 extensions tailored for the OpenVMS environment.

                               DIGITAL                      May 1995

                                                         AE-Q507B-TE

 

 The fundamental principles underlying the FIMS model are embodied in
 DECforms:

 o  True separation of form and function

 o  Efficient distribution of forms processing

 o  Ease of use

 o  Flexibility of user interface control

 o  Programming language independence

 One of the most powerful FIMS principles reflected in the DECforms ar-
 chitecture is complete separation of form and function. User inter-
 face processing is completely removed from the application program and
 totally isolated within the form itself. In DECforms, a form is not
 simply a collection of fields and background text describing the form's
 appearance. A DECforms form includes not just elements related to ap-
 pearance, but also data and procedural elements that control the pro-
 cessing of the user's interaction with the form. The application pro-
 gram is only concerned with the processing of data, not with the gath-
 ering and display of data at the user interface. This makes applica-
 tion programs much simpler to develop and easier to maintain, and it
 also allows a single application to support multiple end-user device
 environments with user interfaces tailored to the capabilities of the
 device and to the needs of the end-user. In other words, a single ap-
 plication program can use DECforms to support users sitting at VTs with
 character-cell based forms, as well as users sitting at Motif-based
 workstations with much more sophisticated bitmap forms.

 Forms are comprised of one or more panels that can be of any width and
 height (for VTs, panels must be no larger than the size of the phys-
 ical display device). If the data required to satisfy an application
 program's request cannot be physically or aesthetically fit onto a sin-
 gle screen, multiple panels can be defined within a single form to con-
 tain all the necessary fields and background text. Thus, a form can
 be as large as needed.


                                  2

 

 When panels are displayed on the screen, they are displayed in view-
 ports (windows) that can be located any place on the screen. For VT
 devices, DECforms provides a complete windowing system to manage these
 viewports. For Motif-based devices, the services of the Motif window-
 ing system are used - each viewport is associated with a separate Mo-
 tif window. On VT devices, viewports are static - they cannot be moved
 by the user. On Motif devices, the user can move, resize, and mini-
 mize viewports as needed. DECforms automatically displays and removes
 viewports with their associated panels to gather and display all the
 data required by the application program.

 A form is described by the Independent Form Description Language (IFDL).
 The IFDL, while primarily declarational, includes procedural constructs
 as well. Field level control, screen navigation, panel management, and
 cross field and relational validations are among the many form pro-
 cessing activities that can be performed by the IFDL without the need
 to return to the application program.

 DECforms allows a single application to support multiple types of users
 with interfaces tailored to their particular end-user environments,
 where those environments are differentiated by such factors as desk-
 top device and natural language. This tailoring is accomplished by uti-
 lizing another DECforms structure called a layout. Sets of panels tai-
 lored for a particular environment can be grouped together in a lay-
 out. A form can consist of multiple layouts, each tailored for a dif-
 ferent environment-for instance, one form can contain layouts for both
 VT devices and Motif devices as well as layouts for English users, French
 users, and German users. At run-time, DECforms chooses the one lay-
 out from within the form appropriate for the end-user environment.

 The application program interacts with DECforms through a very sim-
 ple, six-call record-level interface. Either single or multiple records
 can be transferred in a single request.

 All field-level processing is performed by the DECforms Run-time Sys-
 tem, not by the application program. The DECforms Run-time System pro-
 vides a wide variety of form, panel, and field-level control and pro-
 cessing capabilities, including:


                                  3

 

 o  Multiline text fields

 o  Simple arithmetic operations within the form

 o  Scrolled regions with the following characteristics:

    -  Vertical or horizontal scrolling

    -  Containing one- or two-dimensional arrays

    -  Partial or full-line scrolling

    -  Multiple lines per scrolled entry

 o  Conditionally protecting, highlighting, and concealing fields

 o  Changing video attributes dynamically based on real-time events

 o  Highlighting fields when the cursor is present

 o  Color support on VT241s and VT340s via mapping to video attributes

 o  Format validations:

    -  Character type

    -  Entry required

    -  Minimum length

    -  Full field

    -  No data input

 o  Content validations:

    -  Range check

    -  List check

 o  Context validations:

    -  Against a general expression

    -  Cross-field validations

 o  Calling a user-defined routine (procedural escape routine) to per-
    form more complex validations, including file lookups

                                  4

 

 o  Built-in flexible field navigation capabilities on VTs allowing the
    operator to move among fields in any manner desired

 o  Timeouts on field entries

 o  Toggling between insert/overstrike mode

 For Motif devices, DECforms provides the following additional graph-
 ical user interface (GUI) control and appearance capabilities:

 o  Use of the mouse for random field navigation and other screen func-
    tions

 o  Full font and color support

 o  Push buttons

 o  Slider fields (scale widget)

 o  Horizontal and vertical scroll bars on data arrays, multiline text
    fields, and panels

 o  Cut and paste text within fields, between fields, between panels,
    and between windows

 o  Shadows and borders for 3D appearance

 o  Open and closed polylines with different line styles

 o  Grey scale fill patterns

 DECforms also provides an extremely flexible mechanism for defining
 functions and redefining keyboards to suit the operator environment.
 This includes support for multikey function definitions. On Motif de-
 vices, chorded key functions are supported.

 DECforms supports most OpenVMS data types, which means that data type
 conversion does NOT have to be performed by the application program
 in most cases.

 DECforms can be used with DEC DATATRIEVE to provide powerful, window-
 like forms interfaces for queries and reports on data stored in DEC
 RMS, Oracle Rdb[TM] for OpenVMS, and Oracle CODASYL DBMS[TM] files.

 Internationalization Features

 DECforms includes numerous internationalization features, allowing ap-
 plications to support user interfaces in multilingual environments.
 These features include:

 o  Multiple natural language layouts per form

 o  International date formats

 o  Numeric data formatting, including replacing decimal point with comma

 o  Multiple character currency signs

 o  Multiple character sets

 o  Flexible positioning of fields and literals to allow for transla-
    tion

 o  OpenVMS Message Files to allow for translation

 o  Integrated support for Hebrew language form development and pro-
    cessing, including right-to-left text path

 Printing Support

 Through the use of the printing layout, DECforms provides the capa-
 bility for rendering high-quality, bitmap hardcopy forms for print-
 ing on PostScript printers. The printing layout contains the speci-
 fication of a user interface that is output only and specifies its out-
 put device as a file, rather than a physical device. This file can serve
 as input to other DDIF-capable applications, for ultimate printing or
 inclusion in compound documents.

 Through the use of the printing layout, DECforms also supports the con-
 cept of "batch printing" in which applications can use DECforms for
 high-volume forms printing without the need for a physical display de-
 vice.

 Components

 Form Development Environment (FDE)

                                  6

 

 The FDE allows a form designer to create a form interactively. The FDE
 provides menus that help the designer step through various tasks of
 form creation and modification. The FDE is used with either the VT-
 based Panel Editor or the Motif-based Panel Editor to create the ap-
 pearance of the form. The FDE also provides access to text editors,
 including DEC LSE, to allow a designer to write statements in the In-
 dependent Form Description Language (IFDL) that describes a DECforms
 form.

 Panel Editors

 The VT-based Panel Editor and the Motif-based Panel Editor allow the
 user to create graphic form elements in an interactive, "What You See
 Is What You Get" (WYSIWYG) fashion. The panel editors support the in-
 teractive creation of the visual elements of a form's panels: back-
 ground text and graphics, and the locations, sizes and attributes of
 fields.

 Independent Form Description Language (IFDL)

 The IFDL is a semi-procedural language that completely describes a DEC-
 forms form. It allows the form designer to create a form (noninter-
 actively), specifying its appearance and functions. While the appear-
 ance of a form can be entirely created by the panel editors, proce-
 dural aspects of the forms, such as specialized responses to function
 keys and specialized data validation, must be specified directly with
 IFDL statements. An IFDL source file is a text file that can be cre-
 ated or modified with any text editor.

 LSE templates are available for the IFDL language to aid in the cre-
 ation and maintenance of IFDL source code. DECforms also supports the
 Compile and Review capabilities of the LSE.

 The IFDL also includes a COPY statement that provides for the copy-
 ing of record and field definitions from the Oracle CDD/Repository[TM].
 DECforms supports Oracle CDD/Repository pieces tracking by deposit-
 ing information in the dictionary indicating that a particular form
 has used a certain record. DECforms can also use Oracle CDD/Repository
 records defined with the BASED ON attribute and those referenced through
 RDB$RELATIONS.

                                  7

 

 IFDL Translator

 The IFDL translator compiles an IFDL source file into a binary form
 file. This form file is then ready for use with its application. Its
 appearance can be tested on a terminal screen or printed. The binary
 form file may be analyzed by other DECforms utilities, or edited in
 the FDE or the appropriate panel editor.

 Back Translator

 The Back Translator converts a binary form file into an IFDL source
 file. Essentially, it performs the reverse function of the IFDL Trans-
 lator. As a result, it provides a method of editing the IFDL source
 for a form created or modified by the FDE or panel editor. The IFDL
 source statements that the Back Translator produces also provide a com-
 plete textual description of the form.

 Extract Utility

 The Extract Utility performs three functions:

 o  Produces a printable representation of a form's panels from a form
    file.

 o  Creates object modules containing a form. These object modules can
    then be linked in an executable image with a program as a memory-
    resident form for use by the same program in a single session or
    in multiple sessions. The modules can also be linked in shareable
    images for use by multiple sessions from multiple processes.

 o  Produces an object module that contains pointers, or vectors, to
    procedural escape routines named in the form file. Escape routines
    are calls from the form to user-supplied subroutines created to do
    additional processing outside the form.

 Test Utility

 The Test Utility allows certain aspects of the form to be tested sep-
 arately from its application program. It allows a form designer to check
 the appearance of a form's panels without having to first write a pro-
 gram.

                                  8

 

 VT-to-Pixel Layout Converter

 The VT-to-Pixel Layout Converter takes as input a DECforms binary .FORM
 file containing a character cell layout and produces as output an .IFDL
 source file containing a pixel layout in addition to the original character-
 cell layout. The new layout is a "first-pass" pixel layout that re-
 quires some additional manual modifications to effectively take ad-
 vantage of the additional characteristics of the pixel device, such
 as the use of the mouse and the full range of fonts and colors.

 FMS Converter

 The FMS Converter (available on VAX and Alpha) is a migration tool that
 converts an FMS form or the forms in an FMS form library into a DEC-
 forms IFDL source file. This process converts the appearance of the
 FMS forms into a similar appearance described by the DECforms IFDL.
 The converter does NOT convert the application program or the User Ac-
 tion Routines associated with the FMS forms. The FMS Converter works
 with forms created with FMS V2.0 or later.

 VAX TDMS Converter (available on VAX only)

 A VAX TDMS Converter is available from Digital as a separately order-
 able product (order number QB-270AA-W* for the base package). This tool
 converts VAX TDMS forms and request definitions into DECforms IFDL.
 The tool also includes a COBOL translator for converting TDMS calls
 in a COBOL application program to equivalent DECforms calls.

 Sample Applications and Demonstration Forms

 The sample applications show how a form and an application program can
 interact. One of the samples includes a simple form with a few pan-
 els and a simple application program that makes requests of the form
 through the Form Manager. This introductory sample application is avail-
 able only in FORTRAN.

 The more complex sample application includes a form with many panels
 and many responses to various events, as well as an application pro-
 gram that makes several requests of the form. This application is avail-
 able in Ada, BASIC, C, COBOL, DIBOL, FORTRAN, Pascal, and PL/I.

                                  9

 

 In addition to the sample applications, the DECforms full development
 kit contains a package of demonstration forms, their sources, and a
 demonstration guide illustrating a number of key features of DECforms.

 Form Manager

 The Form Manager is the interface between an application program and
 a display device. It is a run-time system that controls form display
 and operator input on terminals. The Form Manager provides six requests
 for communication between the form and the application. These requests
 (routines in the Form Manager) allow the application to enable the form
 for use, send data to the form, receive data from it (separately or
 in one call), disable the form at the end of a session, or asynchronously
 cancel a request.

 The Form Manager is included with the DECforms Full Development Sys-
 tem and is also offered separately in the optional DECforms Run-time
 System. The only DECforms component available in this latter option
 is the Form Manager. The Run-time System allows the execution of ap-
 plications using DECforms on a machine other than the one used to de-
 velop the application.

 Developing Forms on VAX Systems for Display on Remote IBM 3270 Ter-
 minals

 A special version of DECforms V1.4, shipped exclusively as part of the
 DEC SNA 3270 Application Services software, allows remote SNA-networked
 IBM 3270 terminal and PC users to access forms-oriented VAX applica-
 tions. This special version of DECforms provides users with additional
 features in the development tools to develop and maintain forms for
 display on 3270 class devices and a Run-time System that can gener-
 ate and interpret a 3270 data stream. This version of DECforms is not
 available as a standalone product and can only be used in conjunction
 with DEC SNA 3270 Application Services software and the DEC SNA Do-
 main Gateway. The media and documentation for this version of DECforms
 are available as part of the DEC SNA 3270 Application Services prod-
 uct; however, a standard DECforms development license is required to
 use this version. Refer to the DEC SNA 3270 Application Services Soft-
 ware Product Description (38.70.xx) for more details.

 DECforms Code Generation Using DECADMIRE

 An alternative to the use of the DECforms Form Development Environ-
 ment and panel editor tools is the use of DECADMIRE for generating DEC-
 forms IFDL source code. DECADMIRE is a prototyping and code generat-
 ing tool for DECforms timesharing and transaction processing appli-
 cations. DECADMIRE generates DECforms IFDL source code as well as COBOL,
 Pascal, FORTRAN 3GL code, Oracle CDD/Repository code, SQL for databases,
 and ACMS task and task group definitions. The DECforms development kit
 is still required to produce a .FORM file, using the Form Translator
 to take the .IFDL source file generated by DECadmire and translate it
 into a .FORM file, ready for use at application execution time. Re-
 fer to the DECADMIRE Software Product Description (SPD 52.65.xx) for
 more information.

 Documentation

 The DECforms documentation set is available with the DECforms full de-
 velopment option and is available separately. It is not available with
 the DECforms run-time only option. The documentation set consists of:

 o  DECforms Guide to Developing an Application

 o  DECforms Guide to Commands and Utilities

 o  DECforms Programmer's Reference Manual

 o  DECforms IFDL Reference Manual

 o  DECforms Style Guide for Character-Cell Devices

 o  DECforms Guide to Converting VAX FMS Applications

 1. DECforms also supports the Hebrew versions of the VT100, VT200, and
    VT300 series terminals.

 2. The VT131 is supported in VT102 mode only.

 3. DECforms does not support the use of the 25th status line nor the
    use of the locator device on VT300-series terminals.



                                 15

 

 4. DECforms panels of up to 72 lines may be defined for VT420 and VT500
    series terminals. These terminals can display 24, 36, or 48 lines
    on a single screen. Panels consisting of a number of lines greater
    than the screen size can be panned under local hardware control by
    the terminal. DECforms does not support access to the F1-F5 func-
    tion keys or to the ALTERNATE key. The COMPOSE key is supported when
    configured for LOCAL COMPOSE.

 5. DECforms supports display of forms on directly connected IBM 3270-
    class terminals only when those terminals are connected to the CXM04
    3270 Terminal Option Card of a DECserver 550. This option card makes
    the IBM 3270-compatible device appear as a VT220 to the applica-
    tion.

 Terminal Emulators

 Terminal emulators on workstations and personal computers are supported
 only to the extent that the emulator conforms to the VT100, VT220, or
 VT320 environment it is emulating.

 Printers

 DECforms printing layouts can be converted to PostScript files that
 can then be printed on any device compatible for printing PostScript
 files.

 DECforms character-cell panels and forms can be printed on any Dig-
 ital printer. Video attributes are not printed and lines are drawn us-
 ing the characters "-", "+", " " rather than the line-drawing char-
 acter set. Disk Space Requirements OpenVMS (Block Cluster Size = 1):

 Full Development System

 Disk space required for    33,000 blocks
 installation:
                            (16.9 Mbytes)

 Disk space required for    32,000 blocks
 use (permanent):

                                 16

 


                            (16.4 Mbytes)

 Run-time Only System

 Disk space required for    2,500 blocks
 installation:
                            (1.3 Mbytes)

 Disk space required for    2,000 blocks
 use (permanent):
                            (1.1 Mbytes)

 These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
 sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
 system environment, configuration, and software options.

 Memory Requirements for DECwindows Motif Support

 The minimum supported memory for this application running in a stan-
 dalone DECwindows Motif environment with both the client and the server
 executing on the same system is 16MB.

 The performance and memory usage of DECwindows Motif applications are
 particulary sensitive to system configuration. Less memory may be re-
 quired on the client system (the system where the software is installed
 and executed) if the server (the component that displays the appli-
 cation) resides on another system. More memory may be required on a
 system with several applications running, or may be desirable to im-
 prove the performance of an application.

 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

 For Systems Using Terminals (No DECwindows Motif Interface):

 o  OpenVMS Operating System V6.1 or higher

 For Workstations Running DECwindows Motif:

 o  OpenVMS Operating System V6.1 or higher

                                 17
