 DESCRIPTION

 The BASEstar Open Device Access Software (DAS) for Allen-Bradley Data
 Highway allows users to access Allen-Bradley Programmable Logic Con-
 trollers (PLCs) through BASEstar Open Device Services, BASEstar Open
 Data Services or DEComni Services.

 Via BASEstar Open Device Services the user may configure device and
 variable definitions, read and write variable values, and configure
 for polled data collection and information reports.

 BASEstar Open Data Services provide device independent access to shop
 floor data allowing the user to configure data points, read and write
 data point values and generate events based on data changes.

 Users can also perform a variety of device access functions for Allen-
 Bradley PLCs using the Allen-Bradley DAS by interfacing directly to
 DEComni APIs.

 The BASEstar Open DAS for Allen-Bradley Data Highway supports the fol-
 lowing Allen-Bradley PLCs:

 o  Allen-Bradley PLC-2, PLC-2/5, PLC-2/15, PLC-2/16, PLC-2/17, PLC-
    2/20, PLC-2/30
