           PRODUCT NAME:    DECosap/H1 Version 3.1                SPD 47.95.04
                           (DIGITAL Omni Services for SINEC Automa-
                           tion Protocols/SINEC H1 Services)

           DESCRIPTION

           DECosap is a network communication product. It provides a solution to
           connect DIGITAL applications with shop floor devices based on 
           Siemens[R]SINEC[R] H1 communication protocol. SINEC H1 services are
           also identified as PG communication services in Siemens literature.

           Siemens SINEC H1 has been recommended for connecting PLCs and host
           computers on large configurations. It has been specified on top of
           the ISO/OSI Transport Layer and it is based on Ethernet to improve
           effectiveness (through higher performance) and efficiency (through
           lower costs per connection). 

           DECosap/H1 fully supports the SINEC H1 communication protocol.

           Features

           As the SINEC H1 communication protocol is defined on top of the ISO
           OSI Transport Layer, DECosap relies upon DECnet/OSI to complete the
           communication stack. For more information, refer to the DECnet/OSI
           Software Product Description (SPD 41.92.xx).

           Because of the functional compatibility between Siemens SINEC AP and
           MMS (Manufacturing Messaging Services), ISO International Standard 
           9506, Parts 1 and 2, DECosap is integrated with the software
           architecture of the DEComni API product to supply the Application
           Programming Interface (API). For more information, refer to the
           DEComni API Software Product Description (SPD 47.88.xx).

                                                                    April 1997

                                                                   AE-PZATD-TE

           (DIGITAL Omni Services for SINEC Automation Protocols/SINEC H1 Ser-
           vices)

           DECosap also provides Device Access Software (DAS) for connecting
           Siemens SINEC H1 devices for BASEstar Open Server systems. For
           further information, refer to the DEComni API Software Product
           Description (SPD 47.82.xx).

           Components

           o  DECosap/H1 Services

           This component adds support for SINEC H1 functionality via the
           DEComni API. Supported services are listed at the end of this 
           Software Product Description and are divided into the following
           categories:

              -  Environmental Management

              -  Messages

              -  Device Management

              -  Variable Access

           o  Configuration and Management Facilities

           DECosap/H1 uses the DEComni API facility ODSCL.

           On OpenVMS platforms, the following DEComni API facilities are sup-
           ported:

              -  ODF (Omni Definition Facility)

              -  OmniView

           o  Support for the Device Access Services of BASEstar Open

           o  Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)

           The DECosap IVP performs a series of tests to verify proper instal-
           lation.

           Documentation

           DECosap includes the following documentation:

           o  A platform-specific Network Manager's and Programmer's Guide pro-
              vides an overview of SINEC H1 and SINEC AP (see the DECosap/AP
              Software Product Description-SPD 47.96.04) concepts and
              terminology. It includes a description of the services that are
              available through DEComni API and features of DECosap. It also
              describes how to use the DEComni API utility ODSCL.

           o  A platform-specific Installation Guide that explains how to pre-
              pare for installation, how to install the product, and what to do
              after DECosap is installed.

           INSTALLATION

           Before attempting to install the software, the customer must have all
           pre-requisite hardware and software. Digital Equipment Corporation
           recommends that a customer's first purchase include DIGITAL
           Installation Services.

           Connectivity to all other nodes within the network is the responsi-
           bility of the customer.

               (CBB) services and parameters that are supported by DECosap/H1
               Version 3.1. They are compared to the services provided within
               the first version. The level of support depends upon the level
               of functionality provided by the target Siemens communication
               processors.
