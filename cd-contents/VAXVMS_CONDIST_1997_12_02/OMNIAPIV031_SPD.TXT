 Components

 DEComni API

 DEComni API contains a callable runtime library that is an implemen-
 tation of the MMS Device Model. Service classes supported are in the
 following categories: Environment, VMD Support, Domains, Program In-
 vocations, and Variables.

 ODSCL

 ODSCL is a command line interface to the Omni Directory Service. This
 management level tool provides system managers the following functions:

 o  Register directory names

 o  Deregister directory names

 o  Modify directory names

                                                          April 1997

                                                         AE-OYTAD-TE

 

 o  Query the directory

 OmniView

 OmniView is a demonstration application written using the callable in-
 terface that operates in a DECwindows Motif[R] environment. It pro-
 vides a limited user interface to the following MMS client services
 from a system running the prerequisite software:

 o  Initiate

 o  Conclude

 o  Status

 o  Abort

 o  GetNameList

 o  Identify

 o  GetCapabilityList

 o  Read

 o  Write

 o  Start

 o  Stop

 o  Reset

 o  GetVariableAccessAttributes

 o  GetDomainAttributes

 o  GetProgramInvocationAttributes

 OmniView is only supported on OpenVMS systems.

 Object Definition Facility (ODF)

                                  2

 

 ODF is used to define the objects and attribute values that are ex-
 pected to be found at a remote Virtual Manufacturing Device (VMD). This
 facility is also used to define aspects of a local VMD if supported
 by the application.

 ODF is used to define the mapping of MMS variable types to and from
 OpenVMS data type definitions.

 ODF is only supported on OpenVMS systems.

 DEComni API Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)

 The DEComni API IVP performs a series of tests to verify proper in-
 stallation.

 INSTALLATION

 Only experienced customers should install the DEComni API product. DIG-
 ITAL recommends that all other customers purchase DIGITAL Installa-
 tion Services. These services provide for installation of the soft-
 ware product by an experienced DIGITAL software specialist.

 Installation for DEComni API consists of the following:

 o  Verification that all components of DEComni API have been received

 o  Verification that the necessary versions of the pre-requisite soft-
    ware and documentation are available

 o  Verification of the appropriate system parameters

 o  Verification that the system meets the minimum hardware and soft-
    ware requirements as specified this SPD

 o  Customer making available for a reasonable period of time, as mu-
    tually agreed upon by DIGITAL and the customer, all hardware com-
    munication facilities and terminals that are to be used during in-
    stallation

 o  Installation of the DEComni API software by creating the necessary
