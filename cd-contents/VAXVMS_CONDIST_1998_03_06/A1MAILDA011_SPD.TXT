           PRODUCT NAME:  ALL-IN-1 MAIL/DANSK for VMS, Version 1.1         SPD
           27.H8.00

           DESCRIPTION

           ALL-IN-1 MAIL is an electronic messaging application which implements
           the international messaging standards set by the CCITT X.400 P2 rec-
           ommendations. It provides a means of exchanging messages and attached
           data with other users, and is a consistent user interface across het-
           erogeneous desktop devices in a client/server implementation.

           Layered on top of Digital Equipment Corporation's VAX Message Router
           (SPD 26.33.xx), ALL-IN-1 MAIL interacts with all other MAILbus gate-
           ways and complementary products.

           ALL-IN-1 MAIL is a client/server implementation supporting Video Ter-
           minals, DOS[1] PCs, the Microsoft[R] Windows[TM] Environment,
           Apple[R] Macintosh[R] PCs, DECwindows VMS workstations, and other
           X11 display devices. ALL-IN-1 MAIL represents an upgrade path for
           current users of Digital's VMS Personal Mail Utility (VMSmail) or
           DECwindows VMSmail.

           ALL-IN-1 MAIL has no technical dependency whatever on the ALL-IN-1
           integrated office product. It may be used entirely independent of
           that product. DOS and DECwindows clients are also available which
           connect directly into the ALL-IN-1 integrated office system base and
           do not require the ALL-IN-1 MAIL Server. For more information, refer
           to the ALL-IN-1 DESKtop for DOS Software Product Description (SPD
           50.20.xx) and ALL-IN-1 Services for DECwindows (SPD 33.22.xx).

           ALL-IN-1 MAIL/DANSK for VMS, Version 1.1              SPD 27.H8.00


           Client software performs services for the user. This software usually
           resides on an intelligent desktop device and takes advantage of the
           processing power on the desk. The VMS clients (for Video Terminals or
           DECwindows devices) run on VMS and must reside within the same node
           or VAXcluster as the server.

           Clients are connected to the ALL-IN-1 MAIL Server which performs
           local- and wide-area network delivery services.

           Transport between ALL-IN-1 MAIL Servers and between ALL-IN-1 MAIL and
           the other products in the ALL-IN-1 Phase II product family is
           performed by the VAX Message Router. Optional gateways may also be
           connected to the VAX Message Router as needed for mail transfer in a
           multi-vendor environment.

           A user might alternately use an intelligent workstation in the
           office, a video terminal at home, and a DOS laptop PC while
           traveling. Clients are provided for all three situations/and more,
           all using the same user mailbox and files on the server.

           ALL-IN-1 MAIL adheres to the National Institute for Science and Tech-
           nology (NIST) profile of 1984 CCITT X.400 recommendations. It
           provides a level of messaging service compatible with that of the
           electronic messaging subsystem of the ALL-IN-1 integrated office
           system, and adds new service elements defined in X.400 and ALL-IN-1
           MAIL.

           This document describes three of the components of the ALL-IN-1 MAIL
           product family: the Server, the client for Video Terminals, and the
           client for DECwindows. For information on other available components,
           refer to ALL-IN-1 MAIL Product Family Software Product Description
           (SPD 31.51.xx).

           ALL-IN-1 MAIL/DANSK for VMS, Version 1.1              SPD 27.H8.00


           Compatibility with VMSmail

           Users can migrate easily from VMSmail to ALL-IN-1 MAIL. The
           interfaces are logical extensions of the VMSmail interface, and
           commands and services will be familiar. Addresses and distribution
           lists used in VMSmail can be used in ALL-IN-1 MAIL. From the
           VMS-resident clients, nickname logicals may be used. Most addresses
           used in VMSmail distribution lists may be used in ALL-IN-1 MAIL
           with similar restrictions as found when using such a list from
           another node. (Refer to product documentation for details.)

           No file cabinet conversion is required for either of the VMS-based
           interfaces. A one-time file cabinet conversion is required to make
           VMSmail messages available from the PC.

           Messages can be exchanged with VMSmail on the same system or
           elsewhere in the DECnet network by means of the VAX Message Router
           VMSmail Gateway. This is included in the ALL-IN-1 MAIL Wide Area
           Network Server Package or can be purchased as an option.

           Users can select an editor for use in ALL-IN-1 MAIL. Any editor
           called or spawned under VMSmail can be called or spawned from
           ALL-IN-1 MAIL.

           Compatibility with ALL-IN-1

           Messages can be exchanged with the ALL-IN-1 integrated office system
           by means of the VAX Message Router using the same style of address-
           ing.

           The services of ALL-IN-1 MAIL are compatible with services in the
           electronic messaging subsystem of ALL-IN-1. For example, receipt
           requests from either product are honored by the other. New features
           defined in the CCITT X.400 P2 recommendations may be implemented in
           stages by both products.

           Distribution lists created in the ALL-IN-1 integrated office system
           can be used in ALL-IN-1 MAIL. They work with the same restrictions
           found when sending a list to another ALL-IN-1 office system node.
           (Refer to product documentation for details.) Addressing strings used
           in the ALL-IN-1 office system work equally well in ALL-IN-1 MAIL,
           with the exception

           ALL-IN-1 MAIL/DANSK for VMS, Version 1.1              SPD 27.H8.00


           of addressing strings which invoke ALL-IN-1's foreign protocol hook
           (those beginning with underscore).

           X.400 Message Transport

           Messages can be exchanged with other ALL-IN-1 MAIL domains and ser-
           vices which meet international X.400 P2 conformance criteria. Confor-
           mance testing is being done in the United States and Europe.

           In ALL-IN-1 MAIL, each customer network is referred to as a "domain."
           Within a customer network, messages are transported by means of DEC-
           net wherever DECnet is available. Transport to another vendor's X.400
           service requires an OSI networking stack and the VAX Message Router
           X.400 Gateway (MRX).

           OSI message exchange requires at least one MRX Gateway in each Dig-
           ital domain (usually one per customer network). Refer to the VAX Mes-
           sage Router X.400 Gateway Software Product Description (SPD 27.50.xx)
           for hardware/software requirements.

           Supporting the Multi-Vendor Environment

           MAILbus offers a series of off-the-shelf gateways and a gateway de-
           velopment kit to create other gateways for message exchange with
           other vendors' proprietary mail systems. Refer to the Software
           Product Description (SPD) for the appropriate products'
           hardware/software requirements.

           Directory Services

           ALL-IN-1 MAIL uses Digital's Enterprise-wide Directory Service (DDS)
           as its user address directory. This distributed directory, available
           as part of the VAX Message Router, links ALL-IN-1 MAIL, the ALL-IN-1
           integrated office system, the gateways, and any other agents sharing
           its directory services.

           Users can access the DDS directory while addressing a memo or creat-
           ing an entry in their Personal Address Book (PAB). The PAB is an in-
           tegral part of ALL-IN-1 MAIL and is located in each user's personal


                                            4

 



           ALL-IN-1 MAIL/DANSK for VMS, Version 1.1              SPD 27.H8.00


           mail account, or in the local file store on the intelligent client
           device. The user references a PAB entry by using its user-assigned
           nickname. Distribution lists may contain nicknames.

           The DDS directory is a networking resource available only while the
           server connection is in place. If messages are created and addressed
           on the Workstation in the absence of the server connection, the user
           can still use locally stored nicknames and distribution lists, or
           type the full address string.

           Distribution Lists

           Distribution lists are simple text files stored in the user's mail
           area. These distribution lists can be shared among a group of users
           by using the VMS Access Control facilities.

           Filing Services

           ALL-IN-1 MAIL provides a filing structure of drawers and folders as
           well as access to RMS files. Filing services are similar in nature to
           VMSmail. A DECwindows device with local storage may choose to have
           one or more drawers on the local device in addition to one or more
           drawers on the server.

           VMS-based drawers may be shared among groups of users, with each
           user's privileges defined by VMS access controls.

           Message Retrieval

           Messages can be retrieved based on user specification of certain
           header fields and filing structures.

           File Formats

           As detailed below, a number of different editors can be used with
           each interface. The editor most appropriate to a DECwindows device
           will be different from that which is preferred on a video terminal. A
           variety of file formats come with these editors. ALL-IN-1 MAIL is
           designed to handle various file formats with features that allow
           configuration for maximum readability of messages. The system allows
           for the automated handling of messages in ASCII, DDIF, WPS-PLUS and
           DX, and for

           invocation of other file formatting or conversion routines that con-
           form to Digital's Compound Document Architecture (CDA).

           The client can be set-up to invoke viewers or applications based on
           the file type of each attachment.

           Beginning with Version 1.1, ALL-IN-1 MAIL can be set to perform au-
           tomatic conversions of message components as they are delivered, us-
           ing optional VMS-resident conversion services such as Digital's CDA
           Converter Library for VMS (SPD 31.31.xx) or other third-party
           converters such as KEYpak[R] for VMS (SPD 32.71.xx). This is an
           additional-cost option. Users can register their file format
           preferences in the profile.

           For advice on interchange of specific file formats, especially across
           gateways, consult your local Digital office.

           There may be some difficulties exchanging DDIF documents with the
           ALL-IN-1 integrated office system, Version 2.3. Contact your local
           Digital office for details.

           Help

           Users can get help for ALL-IN-1 MAIL using the Help facility. Help
           provides basic information on how to perform the function in
           question without the user having to reference the documentation.

           Printing

           ALL-IN-1 MAIL takes advantage of Digital's standard VMS printing fa-
           cilities provided under VMS. The user can specify the printer desti-
           nation and options.

           Messaging Functions

           Users can create, read, and send messages using the commands
           provided. Messages can contain information in a variety of file
           format types including Digital's Document Interchange Format for
           compound documents (DDIF).

           Messages can be forwarded to another destination. Message attachments
           may include another message, a document or file, or even a binary
           file.

           Answering a message is easy. The system automatically addresses the
           answer for transfer back to the original sender. The user can reply
           to the sender, all the original recipients, or to a reply-to list.

           Messages can be addressed to one or more users at any valid MAILbus
           destination (e.g., VMSmail, ULTRIX mail, X.400, etc.) worldwide. File
           formats may possibly be modified by gateways or user agents in order
           to make the memo readable to the recipient. Not all file formats are
           supported by all gateways and user agents. Care should be taken in
           planning the network capabilities to insure maximum readability of
           memos.

           Notifications

           Delivery and Receipt tags can be attached to a message. These tags
           cause a notification message to be generated and returned to the
           originator when the message is delivered or received.

           On-line Notification of New Mail

           The user can choose to receive on-line notification of the arrival of
           new messages.

           Message Redirection

           The user can request that all incoming messages be automatically
           redirected to a secondary address.

           Priority-based Delivery

           Users can choose priority for message delivery. The grade of deliv-
           ery (express, first class, second class) can be specified. Other
           transport services are also available.

           Message Classes

           The user can set a number of indicators to give the recipient infor-
           mation about the nature of the message: Importance (high, medium,
           low), Sensitivity (not restricted, personal, private, company
           confidential).

           Expiration dates may be applied to messages to help facilitate auto-
           matic removal over time.

           These fields may also be used to locate classes of messages in the
           file cabinet.

           System Management

           Required local system management for the mail system is minimal and
           usually automated. A system manager or administrator is required to
           open a standard VMS account; when the user first accesses ALL-IN-1
           MAIL, basic account setup functions are performed automatically; most
           routine functions can be performed by the users.

           There are no special utilities to run for file cabinet maintenance.
           One or all user areas on the server can be backed up or restored us-
           ing standard VMS utilities. Management of the VMS-based file struc-
           tures available to the user are under the control of the user.

           The mail management design adheres to the coordinated management sys-
           tem used by the MAILbus family of products. The ALL-IN-1 MAIL Server
           provides a management utility which allows configuration changes to
           be made, and the status of the mail system to be checked. Invoking
           this utility via the VMS SYSMAN utility allows such operations to be
           managed centrally.

           Internationalization

           ALL-IN-1 MAIL is designed to support multi-lingual operations. It can
           be deployed in a multi-lingual network and can support multi-lingual
           operations on a single server system. For more information, refer to
           the System Support Addendum (SSA 27.H8.00-A).

           ALL-IN-1 MAIL Documentation

           Documentation of the user procedures are included in the individual
           client kits. The Server media kit includes system management documen-
           tation, as well as the software and installation instructions for the
           Server and the DECwindows and Video Terminals clients.

           Packaging

           ALL-IN-1 MAIL for Video Terminals, ALL-IN-1 MAIL for VMS DECwindows
           and ALL-IN-1 MAIL Server for VMS are layered software products which
           reside on VMS.

           ALL-IN-1 MAIL for Video Terminals

           ALL-IN-1 MAIL for Video Terminals looks like VMSmail but communicates
           directly with the Message Router, and uses a rich protocol which ac-
           cesses the full range of messaging services. This client is
           co-located with the ALL-IN-1 MAIL Server. It provides ordinary
           terminals with the same access to the services of ALL-IN-1 MAIL.
           Because it shares the same server with the other ALL-IN-1 MAIL
           clients, it can be used as a work-at-home alternative for users of
           more capable desktop devices.

           Compatibility with VMSmail

           Users can migrate from the VMS Personal Mail Utility (VMSmail) to
           ALL-IN-1 MAIL for Video Terminals. The command-line interface is a
           logical extension of the VMSmail command interface, and commands
           and services in ALL-IN-1 MAIL for Video Terminals will feel familiar.
           Addresses, nickname logicals, and distribution lists used in VMSmail
           may be used in ALL-IN-1 MAIL for Video Terminals.

           ALL-IN-1 MAIL for Video Terminals can locate and view messages in the
           existing VMSmail file cabinet, and copy them into the ALL-IN-1 MAIL
           file cabinet.

           Editors

           The default editor is a simple text editor.

           The VMS-based user can choose from a number of different Digital ed-
           itors as well as third-party editors. Any editor which can be called
           or spawned from VMSmail can be called or spawned from ALL-IN-1 MAIL.

           ALL-IN-1 MAIL for VMS DECwindows

           ALL-IN-1 MAIL for VMS DECwindows is a DECwindows implementation of
           the client software component of ALL-IN-1 MAIL. It adheres to the
           DECwindows Style Guide and can be used either on a workstation that
           is a member of the same Local Area VAXcluster as the server
           software or remotely using an X11 display server device supported
           by Digital.

           Access from Other Platforms

           Since ALL-IN-1 MAIL conforms to the DECwindows standards, users of
           devices which have X-servers available can access the mail
           software. In this case, the message composition and storage
           activities are not handled on the desktop device but on the
           ALL-IN-1 MAIL platform. The windows display is handled by the
           desktop device. This feature provides access for additional desktop
           devices that conform to the DECwindows standards.

           ALL-IN-1 MAIL/DANSK for VMS, Version 1.1              SPD 27.H8.00


           Compatibility with VMSmail and DECwindows VMSmail

           Users can migrate from the VMS Personal Mail Utility (VMSmail) or
           DECwindows VMSmail to ALL-IN-1 MAIL for VMS DECwindows. The
           interface is similar to the DECwindows VMSmail interface; commands
           and services in ALL-IN-1 MAIL for VMS DECwindows will feel familiar.
           Addresses, nickname logicals, and distribution lists used in
           VMSmail may be used in ALL-IN-1 MAIL for VMS DECwindows.

           ALL-IN-1 MAIL for VMS DECwindows can copy messages from the existing
           VMSmail file cabinet into the ALL-IN-1 MAIL file cabinet.

           Editors

           The default editor is a simple text editor.

           The DECwindows user can choose from a number of different Digital ed-
           itors as well as third-party editors. Editors called or spawned from
           DECwindows VMSmail can be called or spawned from ALL-IN-1 MAIL for
           VMS DECwindows, including such windows editors as DECwrite.

           HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

           Processor and/or hardware configurations as specified in the System
           Support Addendum (SSA 27.H8.00-A).

           SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

           For the ALL-IN-1 MAIL Server for VMS to support any or all of the
           clients, and for ALL-IN-1 MAIL for Video Terminals:

           o  VMS Operating System

           o  DECnet-VAX

           The ALL-IN-1 MAIL Server delivers messages among all the users of any
           combination of the available ALL-IN-1 MAIL clients which use this one
           server. Thus, all users on a single VAXcluster or on a single LAN may
           exchange messages via a single ALL-IN-1 MAIL Server.

           ALL-IN-1 MAIL/DANSK for VMS, Version 1.1              SPD 27.H8.00


           The VAX Message Router is required to exchange messages with users on
           other servers or other electronic messaging products. The Message
           Router may be co-resident with the ALL-IN-1 MAIL Server or may reside
           on another DECnet node. To communicate with VMSmail users, the
           VMSmail Gateway is also required.

           Gateway

           Since the Message Router is packaged with the VMSmail Gateway, choose
           ONE of the following packages:

           o  VAX Message Router
              or

           o  VAX Message Router VMSmail Gateway

           PATHWORKS for VMS and/or PATHWORKS for Macintosh (VMS components) are
           required on VMS to support any DOS and/or Macintosh clients using
           PATHWORKS as the connection between client and server. (For
           details, refer to the SPDs for relevant client components.)

           Most configurations will require Message Router, and all sites
           migrating from or interacting with a VMSmail product will require
           the VMSmail Gateway. The ALL-IN-1 MAIL Wide Area Network Server
           Package combines these underlying software components with the
           ALL-IN-1 MAIL Server.

           For the Client ALL-IN-1 MAIL for VMS DECwindows on the
           Workstation:

           o  VMS Operating System (and necessary components of VMS DECwindows)

           o  DECnet-VAX

           Refer to the System Support Addendum (SSA 27.H8.00-A) for availabil-
           ity and required versions of prerequisite/optional software and for
           information regarding components of VMS DECwindows.

           Country Component Software

           For information on country-specific modifications to this product,
           refer to the System Support Addendum (SSA 27.H8.00-A).
