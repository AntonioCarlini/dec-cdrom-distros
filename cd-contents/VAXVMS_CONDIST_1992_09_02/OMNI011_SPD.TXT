     PRODUCT NAME:  DEComni/VMS, Version 1.1             SPD 32.32.01
                    (Digital's OSI Manufacturing Network Intercon-
                    nect)

     DESCRIPTION

     DEComni/VMS is a network communication product and is an imple-
     mentation of the Manufacturing Message Specification, MMS, ISO
     9506-1 and ISO 9506-2. When combined with prerequisite hardware
     and software, DEComni/VMS interoperates with other systems sup-
     porting the Manufacturing Message Specification ISO IS/9506-1
     and ISO IS/9506-2 specification.

     The conformance of DEComni/VMS software to OSI standards is
     specified in Appendix A of this Software Product Description.

     Features

     DEComni/VMS is an implementation of the Manufacturing Message
     Specification, MMS, ISO 9506 consisting of a callable interface
     on VMS which will take the proper arguments and transform them
     into the proper MMS protocol.

     DEComni/VMS provides as a minimal set, the Client Conformance
     requirements for the services specified in MAP Implementation
     Class MAP3.

     The product may interoperate with those device vendors that have
     implemented to ISO IS/9506(MMS).

     DEComni/VMS provides a high level applications programming
     interface (API) with a high degree of functionality built in.
     The interface is easy to use and requires very little support
     code.

     (Digital's OSI Manufacturing Network Interconnect)


     Object Definition Facility (ODF)

     The ODF facility is used to define the objects and attribute
     values that are expected to be found at a remote Virtual Man-
     ufacturing Device (VMD). This facility is also used to define
     aspects of a local VMD if supported by the application.

     ODF is used to define the mapping of MMS variable types to and
     from VMS data type definitions. OMNI API

     This component contains a callable run-time library which is
     an implementation of MMS. The actual support for services is
     listed in the Protocol Implementation Conformance Statement
     (PICS) found in the conformance to standards section. Service
     classes supported are in the following categories: Environment,
     VMD Support, Domains, Program Invocations, and Variables.

     OMNICL

     This component contains a facility to manage aspects of the MMS
     implementation installed on a machine.

     OmniView

     OmniView is a demonstration application written using the
     callable interface that operates in a DECwindows environment. It
     provides a limited user interface to the following MMS client
     services from a VAXstation running the prerequisite software:

     Initiate
     Conclude
     Status
     Abort
     GetNameList
     Identify
     GetCapabilityList
     Read
     Write
     Stop
     Reset

     DEComni/VMS Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)

     The DEComni/VMS IVP performs a series of tests to verify proper
     installation.

     Documentation

     The DEComni/VMS documentation set consists of three hard copy
     documents and four on-line reference documents.

     The hard copy documents supplied with the kit consist of two
     reference cards and a system pocket guide that complement the
     on-line documentation set.

     These cards provide DEComni users with guidelines on how to
     install DEComni and how to get started with OmniView. The pocket
     guide gives DEComni users basic information about API, ODF, and
     OMNICL commands. For an experienced DEComni/VMS user, these
     hard copy documents will provide all that is needed to get
     DEComni running and functional; a detailed, on-line DEComni
     documentation set is available for all users.

     The DEComni/VMS V1.1 on-line documentation set is part of the
     distribution kit and is optionally installed during the software
     installation.

     The on-line documentation set consists of:

     DEComni/VMS Application Programmer's Guide - Provides an
     overview of MMS concepts and terminology and an introduction
     to DEComni procedure calls and DEComni operations and features.

     DEComni/VMS Software Installation Guide - Explains how to pre-
     pare for DEComni installation, how to install the product, and
     what to do after DEComni is installed.

     INSTALLATION

     Only experienced customers should attempt installation of this
     product. Digital recommends that all other customers purchase
     Digital's Installation Services. These services provide for
     installation of the software product by an experienced Digital
     Software Specialist.

     Installation for DEComni/VMS will consist of the following:

     o  Verification that all components of DEComni/VMS have been
        received.

     o  Verification that the necessary versions of the prerequisite
        software and documentation are available.

     o  Verification of the appropriate system parameters.

     Note: Should a customer attempt the installation and require the
     services of a software specialist to modify the previously in-
     stalled operating system parameters, or aid in the installation,
     a time and materials charge will apply.

     o  Verification that the system meets the minimum hardware and
        software requirements (as specified in the SPD).

     o  Customer making available for a reasonable period of time,
        as mutually agreed upon by Digital and the customer, all
        hardware communication facilities and terminals that are to
        be used during installation.

     o  Install the DEComni/VMS software by creating the necessary
        directories and by copying the software from the distribution
        media.
