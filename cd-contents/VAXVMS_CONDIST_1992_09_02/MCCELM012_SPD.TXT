 PRODUCT NAME:  DECmcc Extended LAN Manager AM and FM   SPD 31.33.02
                for VMS, Version 1.2

 DESCRIPTION

 Overview

 DECmcc Extended LAN (Local Area Network) Manager Packages are VMS lay-
 ered products that enable DECmcc Director Family product users to con-
 figure, manage, monitor, and control LAN Bridge, DECbridge, and DECconcentrator
 500 devices in the "Extended LAN" and FDDI network environment. The
 term LAN Bridge is used to refer to Digital Equipment Corporation's
 LAN Bridge 100, LAN Bridge 150, LAN Bridge 200, METROWAVE Bridge, and
 the Chipcom[R] Ethermodem[TM] Broadband Bridge. The term DECbridge is
 used to refer to Digital Equipment Corporation's DECbridge 500 and 600
 Series products.

 The LAN Bridge and DECbridge products are the primary building blocks
 of the "Extended LAN" architecture. An Extended LAN is a collection
 of LANs that are interconnected and logically appear as one large Lo-
 cal Area Network. The DECconcentrator family of products is the pri-
 mary building block of the FDDI network environment. Together these
 environments are physically and logically attached and extended via
 the DECbridge family of products. The DECbridge product line is the
 family of products that allows Ethernet and FDDI networks to commu-
 nicate transparently.

 The LAN Bridge and DECbridge products operate at the data link level,
 and FDDI DECconcentrators operate at the data link and physical link
 levels. Both product sets are transparent to upper-level protocols.

 The DECmcc Extended LAN Manager package options can be added to se-
 lected DECmcc Director Family products to provide management of LAN
 Bridges, DECbridges, and FDDI DECconcentrators. There are two DECmcc
 Extended LAN Manager license option packages.

 o  DECmcc Extended LAN Manager Access Module (AM) - Provides manage-
    ment protocol support for, and user access to, LAN Bridges, DECbridges,
    and FDDI DECconcentrators. This package, added to either the DECmcc
    Director or the DECmcc Basic Management System (BMS) enables users
    to take full advantage of those products' integrated command set,
    graphic and command line user interfaces, and extensibility to reg-
    ister, monitor, and control devices supported by the AM. This AM
    package also enables DECmcc users to customize alarm rules and gen-
    erate performance statistics for the supported devices.

 o  DECmcc Extended LAN Manager Functional Module (FM) - Can option-
    ally be added to a DECmcc Director. Used in conjunction with the
    DECmcc Extended LAN Manager AM package, it provides DECmcc Direc-
    tor users with automatic device registration, FDDI ring map auto-
    topology and LAN Bridge spanning tree autotopology supporting IEEE
    802.1d spanning tree and Digital's LAN Bridge 100 spanning tree pro-
    tocols.

 Note that the functions provided by the DECmcc Extended LAN Manager
 FM package are included as part of the DECmcc Basic Management Sys-
 tem. Both the DECmcc Extended LAN Manager AM and DECmcc Extended LAN
 Manager FM capabilities are included as part of the DECmcc Enterprise
 Management Station on VMS. To utilize the features of the DECmcc Ex-
 tended LAN Manager FM package, the DECmcc Extended LAN Manager AM pack-
 age is required. For more information about the DECmcc products in gen-
 eral, their relationship to one another, and a brief description of
 their features and functions, refer to the DECmcc Director Family Prod-
 uct Overview Software Product Description (SPD 37.19.xx).

 Depending on the user's DECmcc configuration, an additional software
 license may be required. Refer to the Optional Software Section of this
 product's System Support Addendum (SSA 31.33.02-x) for more details.

    and DECbridge family of products

 o  Ability to display and monitor physical ports on the DECbridge 500
    /600 Series and DECconcentrator 500

 o  Ability to display spanning tree characteristics on the LAN Bridge
    and DECbridge family of products

 o  Ability to display and modify protocol database characteristics on
    LAN Bridge 200 and the DECbridge family of products

 o  Ability to display and modify forwarding database characteristics
    on the LAN Bridge and DECbridge family of products

 o  Ability to enable and disable lines on LAN Bridge and DECbridge prod-
    ucts

 o  Ability to enable and disable physical ports on the DECconcentra-
    tor 500

 o  Customize site specific alarms for the devices stored in the MIR
    (management information repository) for faults, errors, and changed
    information

 o  Displaying data-link counters, status, and characteristics on LAN
    bridges, DECbridges and
    DECconcentrators

 o  Remotely, but on the same extended LAN, invoke a device's self-test
    capabilities
