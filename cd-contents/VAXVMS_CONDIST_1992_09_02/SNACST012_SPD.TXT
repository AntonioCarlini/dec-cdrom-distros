           PRODUCT NAME:  DECnet/SNA Gateway for        SPD 25.C6.02
                          Synchronous Transport, Version
                          1.2

           DESCRIPTION

           DECnet/SNA Gateway for Synchronous Transport (DECnet/SNA Gateway-
           ST) is a member of the DECnet/SNA Gateway product family.
           This family consists of hardware and software products that
           allow users to exchange information and share resources bi-
           directionally between suitably configured Digital systems
           in a DECnet environment and IBM® systems in a Systems Net-
           work Architecture (SNA) environment.

           Users on one or more Digital systems can simultaneously per-
           form functions such as accessing IBM application programs
           or other system resources, act as a 3270 display station,
           perform data transfer between Digital and IBM file systems,
           exchange electronic documents and mail messages, submit jobs
           to IBM batch subsystems acting as a Remote Job Entry work-
           station, and implement distributed, task-to-task applica-
           tion programs that run between Digital and IBM systems.

           The DECnet/SNA product set provides a system connecting DEC-
           net and SNA networks which can be used by a wide variety of
           Digital-supplied access routines running under VMS, MS-DOS®,
           and ULTRIX operating environments. DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST is
           managed and configured using the gateway management soft-
           ware that is part of DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST. For additional
           information on the various access routines and their capa-
           bilities, consult the OPTIONAL SOFTWARE section in the Sys-
           tem Support Addendum (SSA 25.C6.02-x).

           DECnet/SNA Gateway for                      SPD 25.C6.02
           Synchronous Transport, Version 1.2

           DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST works in conjunction with either of
           the DEC MicroServer hardware platforms. The DEC MicroServer
           (DEMSA-S*) provides connectivity for up to four synchronous
           lines and the DEC MicroServer-SP (DEMSB-S*) provides a sin-
           gle synchronous line connection. For purposes of this doc-
           ument, the term "DEC MicroServer" is used to refer to ei-
           ther hardware device, unless specifically stated otherwise.

           DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST is part of both the DECnet and the SNA
           networks. Architecturally, it is a DECnet Phase IV end node
           to DECnet and a Physical Unit Type 2.0 to SNA. Its purpose
           is to provide bi-directional network access between DECnet
           and SNA networks. The DEC MicroServer provides physical con-
           nectivity to an Ethernet Local Area Network and when used
           in conjunction with DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST software, it pro-
           vides SNA connectivity to any Phase IV (or Phase IV+) DEC-
           net system in the DECnet network.

           This product can be used in networks currently using other
           DECnet/SNA Gateway systems and can share access routines,
           Ethernet LANs, and load host resources with those systems.

           The DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST software is down-line loaded into
           the DEC MicroServer. The gateway management software, which
           is part of the DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST, is required for the
           VMS or ULTRIX node designated as the load host for DECnet
           /SNA Gateway-ST. Other DECnet systems wishing access to the
           SNA network through the DEC MicroServer should be config-
           ured with the appropriate DECnet/SNA access routines.

           DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST V1.2 supports SNA synchronous commu-
           nications using the SDLC protocol. The number of links sup-
           ported depends on the hardware unit being used (DEC MicroServer
           or DEC MicroServer-SP), line speeds required by the customer,
           and the electrical interface used. Table 1 shows the con-
           figuration matrix for connecting to the SNA network:

           Lines connected to the DEC MicroServer or DEC MicroServer-
           SP should be configured according to guidelines specified
           in the DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST user documentation.

           Loading DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST Software

           The DEC MicroServer requires software to be loaded into mem-
           ory prior to DECnet/SNA Gateway operation. DECnet/SNA Gateway-
           ST software is down-line loaded across the Ethernet Local
           Area Network from a VMS or ULTRIX system acting as a DEC-
           net load host system.

           Most VAX, MicroVAX, VAXstation, VAXserver, DECsystem, and
           DECstation systems running VMS or ULTRIX are supported as
           Ethernet load hosts for DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST. Supported VMS
           or ULTRIX load host configurations are described in the Sys-
           tem Support Addendum (SSA 25.C6.02-x).

           DECnet/SNA Gateway for                      SPD 25.C6.02
           Synchronous Transport, Version 1.2

           DECnet/SNA gateway management software, which is included
           in the DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST package, provides configura-
           tion and management functions for use with the DECnet/SNA
           Gateway for Synchronous Transport V1.2. The gateway manage-
           ment features allow the gateway administrator to configure
           the software executing in the DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST system.
           It also allows the administrator to set up parameters re-
           lating to lines, circuits, physical units, logical units,
           and other key variables necessary for network-to-network com-
           munications between the DECnet and SNA networks. Addition-
           ally, it allows the administrator to manage and diagnose prob-
           lems related to the DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST.

           DECnet/SNA gateway management software is required on the
           VMS or ULTRIX load host and is used to support the DECnet
           /SNA Gateway-ST. It must also be present on any other VMS
           or ULTRIX node whose users want to manage DECnet/SNA Gateway-
           ST and the DEC MicroServer. It is strongly recommended that
           the management software also be installed on VMS or ULTRIX
           systems in order to facilitate application debugging func-
           tions where IBM Interconnect application programs are de-
           veloped using the DECnet/SNA Programming Interface products.

           Gateway management software includes DECnet-style network
           management tools for configuring, controlling, monitoring,
           and troubleshooting the DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST product. These
           activities are generally performed by the Digital system man-
           ager responsible for the designated load host node. Most man-
           agement functions are performed from a node on the Digital
           network rather than at or on the Gateway itself.

           Management of DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST should be viewed as part
           of the Digital environment while the management of the syn-
           chronous circuits connecting the DECnet/SNA Gateway to the
           IBM network is a joint responsibility of the IBM and Dig-
           ital system managers. (Refer to the Customer Responsibil-
           ities section of this Software Product Description.)

           DECnet/SNA Gateway for                      SPD 25.C6.02
           Synchronous Transport, Version 1.2

           DECnet/SNA gateway management software allows a Digital sys-
           tem operator to bootstrap or restart a DECnet/SNA Gateway
           remotely and provide configuration and initialization fa-
           cilities for the DECnet/SNA Gateway.

           Problem Isolation and Determination Tools for the Gateway

           In addition to event logging and error counters, a wide range
           of fault isolation tools are included.

           Trace capabilities, snatrace for ULTRIX and SNATRACE and NET-
           TRACE for VMS, are provided for use with the DECnet/SNA Gateway-
           ST to help debug application programs as well as assist in
           identifying system problems. An operator can run a trace at
           the Circuit, Physical Unit (PU), or Session level, and then
           format the data on a specified Digital system. The trace fea-
           tures are helpful in identifying an error for remedial ac-
           tion.

           A snapshot monitoring utility is provided to display on a
           Digital host-controlled terminal the status of the Gateway's
           buffer availability, the number of SNA sessions currently
           in progress, and other information that pertains to both the
           DECnet and SNA network.

           If an irrecoverable error should occur during operation of
           the DECnet/SNA Gateway system, a memory image may be dumped
           to a designated Ethernet attached VAX or RISC host. This mem-
           ory image may then be provided to your Digital support per-
           sonnel for problem diagnosis.

           Features

           o  NRZI support - Signaling mode for the line(s) from the
              Gateway to the IBM system can be set to NORMAL or NRZI
              (non-return-to-zero-inverted) so that line characteris-
              tics match those set in the IBM ACF/NCP LINE macro.

           Synchronous Transport, Version 1.2

           o  Support for FULL duplex transmission - Circuits can be
              set FULL duplex to allow data to be sent and received si-
              multaneously on full duplex lines. This setting corre-
              sponds to DATMODE=FULL in the IBM ACF/NCP PU macro.

           o  Support for RECFMS - The Gateway can send Record Format-
              ted Maintenance Statistics (RECFMS) messages to the IBM
              system. These messages contain counters requested by the
              IBM Network Problem Determination Application (NPDA) us-
              ing Request Maintenance Statistics (REQMS) messages. Not
              all RECFMS messages are supported by the Gateway. Refer
              to the DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT and -ST Management user doc-
              umentation for more information.

           o  A simplified configuration procedure - After installing
              Gateway-ST gateway management software, a single config-
              uration procedure is run which creates command procedures
              that define items for the DECnet database on the load host,
              and the SNA and DECnet databases on the Gateway.

           o  Extended SDLC - Support for Extended Response Mode SDLC
              (Modulo 128).

           When Using DEC MicroServer Hardware

           o  Synchronous Line support - DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST supports
              up to four SDLC connections at speeds of 64Kbs/circuit
              or less, two connections at 128Kbs/circuit, or a single
              connection at 256Kbs.

           o  Session support - DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST supports up to
              128 concurrent (Logical Unit) sessions for selected ac-
              cess routines.

           When Using DEC MicroServer-SP Hardware

           DECnet/SNA Gateway Orientation and Installation Service

           The Gateway Orientation/Installation Service is REQUIRED in
           conjunction with the customer's first purchase of a DECnet
           /SNA Gateway if the installation is to be warranted and sup-
           ported by Digital. The purpose of this service is to insure
           proper installation of the DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST. It includes
           the following activities:

           o  Verify IBM and Digital hardware and software prerequi-
              sites.

           o  Coordinate customer MIS and Digital Software Services re-
              sources.

           o  Review IBM system generation parameters.

           o  Install the DECnet/SNA Gateway and any load host resi-
              dent DECnet/SNA Gateway access routine software that has
              been ordered concurrently with the DECnet/SNA Gateway for
              the first VMS or ULTRIX host node.

           o  Verify connectivity between installed access routines and
              the IBM system if it has been pre-configured according
              to the guidelines provided by Digital for those products.
              The following access routines qualify for this verifi-
              cation:

              -  DECnet/SNA VMS 3270 Terminal Emulation

              -  DECnet/SNA VMS DISOSS Document Exchange Facility

              -  DECnet/SNA VMS Printer Emulation

              -  DECnet/SNA VMS Remote Job Entry

              -  DECnet/SNA Data Transfer Facility

           Connectivity verification of the DECnet/SNA Gateway with ac-
           cess routine products other than those listed above will be
           done using the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) Soft-
           ware Program supplied with each access routine.

           An installation service is available for the simultaneous
           installation of the DECnet/SNA access routines for each ad-
           ditional VMS or ULTRIX system.

           Digital will provide these services upon customer notifi-
           cation that the system, including all prerequisite hardware
           and software, is ready for installation according to the guide-
           lines listed in the Customer Responsibilities section of this
           Software Product Description. Contact your local Field Ser-
           vice office for additional information on these services.
