           VAX KMS11-BD/BE X.25 Link Level Software is a package of X.25
           Level 2 firmware, plus a VMS device driver for the KMS11-
           BD/BE X.25 Link Level Software. The driver, in conjunction
           with the X.25 Level 2 firmware and KMS11-BD/BE hardware, al-
           lows the VAX/VMS processor to perform high-speed, multi-line,
           synchronous communication in a point-to-point environment.

           The primary purpose of the driver is to allow command, con-
           trol and data information to and from:

           o  VMS users

           o  KMS11-BD/BE firmware

           o  Remote end of communication line

           The driver is full-duplex and maintains internal queues.

           Features

           o  Full-duplex operation

           o  Integrated VMS Level 2 diagnostic support

           o  Integrated VMS UETP (User Environment Test Program) sup-
              port

           o  Support of the KMS11-BD/BE hardware and X.25 link level
              hardware and firmware

           o  Error log support
