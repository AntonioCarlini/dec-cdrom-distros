           PRODUCT NAME:  DECmcc TCP/IP SNMP Access Module       SPD
           32.50.01                for VMS, Version 1.1

           DESCRIPTION

           The DECmcc TCP/IP SNMP Access Module (AM) for VMS, Version
           1.1 enables the DECmcc Director management system to remotely
           manage Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) based equip-
           ment in TCP/IP networks. This version broadens support for
           SNMP management to include MIB2 and vendor-specific MIB ex-
           tensions. It includes a MIB Translation Utility (MIB com-
           piler) that translates any vendors' ASN.1 Concise MIB def-
           inition and integrates it into the DECmcc management infor-
           mation repository. The product also includes private MIBs
           for several members of the DECmcc Strategic Vendor Program.

           The DECmcc TCP/IP SNMP AM for VMS is one component of the
           DECmcc Director family of software, which is based on Dig-
           ital's Enterprise Management Architecture (EMA). The Access
           Module supports the following capabilities:

           o  Fully supports the following Internet Advisory Board (IAB)
              SNMP Standards: RFC's 1060, 1065, 1066, 1155, 1156, 1157,
              1158, 1212, and 1213.

           o  The MIB Translation Utility automatically checks the syn-
              tax of the ASN.1 Concise MIB definition (providing er-
              ror messages to help identify any problems) and trans-
              lates the data for loading into the DECmcc Director's database.
              This simplifies the process of adding the growing num-
              bers of devices being managed using SNMP to the DECmcc
              management system.

           DECmcc TCP/IP SNMP Access Module            SPD 32.50.01
           for VMS, Version 1.1

           o  Allows each new device to be managed using DECmcc's func-
              tional modules, including graphical display with a hi-
              erarchy of domains and customizable backgrounds and icons,
              collection and reporting of historical data, user-defined
              alarms and alerting on MIB attributes thresholds, con-
              figuration information database, and a menu of commands
              to show and set MIB attributes on demand.

           The DECmcc TCP/IP SNMP AM for VMS uses the VMS/ULTRIX Con-
           nection software as the transport mechanism to communicate
           with TCP/IP systems and to translate Internet domain names.
