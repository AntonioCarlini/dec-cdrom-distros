           PRODUCT NAME:  DEC File Optimizer for VMS, Version 1.0 SPD 36.21.00

           DESCRIPTION

           The DEC File Optimizer for VMS is a layered software prod-
           uct which reduces file fragmentation and optimizes file place-
           ment through scheduled defragmentation jobs.

           The key capabilities of the DEC File Optimizer for VMS are:

           o  Reduces file fragmentation for on-line devices.

           o  Gives the user the capability to select or exclude files
              based on:

              -  User choice

              -  How badly fragmented the files are

              -  Whether the file has placement pointers

              -  Whether the files are indexed

           o  Provides scheduling of defragmentation jobs.

           o  Gives the user the ability to classify files as "hot" (fre-
              quently accessed), or "cold" (infrequently accessed) and
              to have them placed on the disk drive accordingly.

           Processors and/or hardware configuration as specified in the
           System Support Addendum (SSA 36.21.00-x).
