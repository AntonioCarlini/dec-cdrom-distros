 PRODUCT NAME:  VMS DECwindows Motif[R], Version 1.0      SPD 36.09.02

 DESCRIPTION[*]

 The DECwindows desktop environment provides a graphical user inter-
 face to VMS. DECwindows incorporates the Open Software Foundation's
 Motif user interface as the design center for DECwindows applications.
 OSF[R]/Motif[R] is a graphical user interface widely acknowledged as the
 industry standard. This user interface defines a powerful model for
 interacting with the VMS Operating System using a point-and-click metaphor.
 DECwindows includes a set of integrated desktop applications that demon-
 strate the power of this metaphor and provide VMS users with a base
 set of desktop tools.

 VMS DECwindows Motif is based on MIT's specification for the X Win-
 dow System, Version 11, Release 4 and OSF/Motif V1.1.1.[*] X Window
 System standards supported as part of DECwindows include the X11 net-
 work protocol, a base set of workstation fonts, the C language bind-
 ing for the Xlib programming library and the C language binding for
 the Xtoolkit library. For workstations users, DECwindows support for
 the Adobe Display PostScript[R] System is integrated into X11.

 Support of the X11 network protocol in the client library and display
 server components provides VMS with the ability to interoperate with
 other X11-compliant systems in a distributed fashion.

 DECwindows supports the client-server distribution inherent in the X
 Window System. This client-server model provides for running X Win-
 dow clients on one node and displaying output to another node, using
 a transport to communicate between the nodes. DECwindows provides three
 transport interfaces - local shared memory, DECnet, and TCP/IP (us-
 ing Digital's VMS/ULTRIX Connection (UCX) layered product). Users can
 also provide their own transport subsystems and transport interfaces.

 To determine whether a separately orderable DECwindows or X applica-
 tion runs on or can communicate with a VMS DECwindows Motif system,
 consult the application's software product description.

 The VMS DECwindows Motif user environment consists of four basic com-
 ponents:

 1. The Session Manager provides the top-level user interface to a DECwin-
    dows workstation. It performs application activation, session-wide
    customization, security management, and session control. The Ses-
    sion Manager also lets users specify the language user interface
    for supported DECwindows applications, provided they have ordered,
    installed, and are licensed to use the appropriate VMS DECwindows
    Motif language variant kit(s). For the supported language variants,
    refer to the User Interface Language Support section of this SPD.
    For a description of which applications have translated user in-
    terfaces and specific local hardware and software support provided
    in the language variant kits, refer to the relevant language vari-
    ant System Support Addendum (SSA).

 2. The Window Manager provides user control for managing windows. The
    OSF/Motif Window Manager is provided as the default window manager.
    The DECwindows X User Interface (XUI) Window Manager is also avail-
    able, allowing the user to choose the type of window management pre-
    ferred.

 3. FileView, a graphical interface to VMS file management, allows users
    to navigate the VMS file system and to perform operations on files.

                                  2

 

 4. The DECterm terminal emulator provides workstation users with a tra-
    ditional character-cell interface for existing VMS features and ap-
    plications. It is a VT320 terminal emulator. It supports ReGIS and
    sixel but is not fully VT340 compatible. Programs written for VT52,
    VT100, VT220, or VT320 class terminals and using VMS terminal driver
    features operate without modification in this workstation window.
    DECterm also provides workstation-oriented features such as mouse-
    based cursor positioning, variable screen sizes, and cutting and
    pasting of text between terminal emulators and other DECwindows ap-
    plications. Many programs can also use these features without mod-
    ification.

 Applications

 A set of integrated desktop applications is provided as a base com-
 ponent of the DECwindows environment. These applications establish and
 demonstrate the consistent DECwindows user model. They also provide
 significant end-user capabilities.

 guage variant SPD/SSAs. Refer also to the ORDERING INFORMATION and SOFT-
 WARE LICENSING Sections of this SPD.

 Programming Support

 The VMS DECwindows Motif environment includes an extensive set of pro-
 gramming libraries and tools for use by developers of new applications.
 The libraries are provided in the form of shareable images.

 There are four categories of libraries provided: standard X Window Sys-
 tem libraries such as Xlib and the Intrinsics, libraries needed to sup-
 port the current base of XUI applications, OSF/Motif toolkit support
 for developing applications using the Motif user interface style, and
 Digital added-value libraries that give users additional capabilities.

                                  4

 

 The eight libraries provided with VMS DECwindows Motif include:

 o  X Window System programming library (Xlib) support

 o  X Window System Intrinsics support (Xtoolkit)

 o  OSF/Motif User Interface support

 o  Digital's Extensions to OSF/Motif

 o  X User Interface (XUI) support

 o  Porting tools to be used to change applications from the XUI in-
    terface to the OSF/Motif user interface style

 o  Compound Document Architecture (CDA) support

 o  Display PostScript (DPS) support

 Components from each of these areas can be used in any combination to
 address the needs of applications. These components can also use the
 tools from a variety of different programming languages. The program-
 ming libraries have been provided with procedural language bindings
 in either the style of the VAX calling standard, the style of the MIT
 C language programming conventions, or both conventions.

 Motif language bindings are provided for the following programming lan-
 guages:

 VAX Ada
 VAX FORTRAN
 VAX C
 VAX Pascal

 XUI language bindings are provided for the following programming lan-
 guages:

 VAX Ada
 VAX FORTRAN
 VAX BLISS-32 Implementation Language
 VAX Pascal
 VAX BASIC
 VAX MACRO

                                  5

 

 VAX C (VAX calling standard or MIT convention)
 VAX PL/I

 The eight programming support libraries are described in more detail
 below.

 X Window System (X) Programming Support

 The X Window System compatible X programming library (Xlib) provided
 by the VMS DECwindows Motif environment supplies basic resource man-
 agement (windows, color maps, input devices) and bitmap graphics ser-
 vices. It defines a mapping of the X network protocol to a procedure
 library.

 X Window System Intrinsics Support

 VMS DECwindows Motif provides a library that contains both the MIT Re-
 lease 3 (R3) and MIT Release 4 (R4) Intrinsics (Xtoolkit). The Xtoolkit
 provides low-level routines allowing the creation of user interface
 objects called widgets. The R3 intrinsics are included in the library
 to provide binary compatibility for images created using previous ver-
 sions of VMS DECwindows.

 Note: All libraries that Digital ships with VMS DECwindows Motif and
 any applications that are relinked will use the new R4 Intrinsics.

 OSF/Motif User Interface Programming Support

 OSF/Motif is the new user interface model for Digital and third-party
 software tailored for the DECwindows environment. It establishes the
 conventions and styles that are encouraged for applications that share
 a DECwindows workstation. Applications use Motif components to build
 user interfaces that look and feel like integrated members of the Dig-
 ital computing environment. OSF/Motif also provides more efficient user
 interface objects called gadgets.

 The OSF/Motif Style Guide, available in the VMS DECwindows Motif Pro-
 gramming Kit, describes the principles, philosophy, and components used
 to build consistent and well-integrated OSF/Motif applications. In ad-
 dition, VMS DECwindows Motif provides the DECwindows Companion to the
 OSF/Motif Style Guide. This document provides additional information

                                  6

 

 concerning the style of OSF/Motif user interfaces. It also provides
 guidelines concerning additional features that Digital provides in the
 VMS DECwindows Motif offering, and includes a Digital preferred ter-
 minology list for a number of supported languages for developers pro-
 ducing OSF/Motif applications in these languages.

 The OSF/Motif style concepts are implemented by the OSF/Motif Toolkit.
 The OSF/Motif Toolkit uses the MIT Xtoolkit. It contains three com-
 ponents:

 o  OSF/Motif widgets and gadgets for implementing common user inter-
    face objects such as scroll bars, menus, and push buttons

 o  Utility routines that provide applications with functions for per-
    forming common tasks such as cut and paste

 o  Resource manager routines for loading user interface definition files
    and creating widgets and gadgets based on the contents of the def-
    inition files

 The OSF/Motif toolkit is used in conjunction with the OSF/Motif User
 Interface Language (UIL) compiler. The user interface definition files
 produced by this compiler contain the data that describes the form of
 DECwindows applications and allows OSF/Motif toolkit widget and gad-
 get details, such as menu item labels, to be stored separately from
 the toolkit and application run-time code. This capability allows ap-
 plication developers to prototype and easily modify user interface de-
 signs, separate form from function in applications, and support trans-
 latable products that do not require recompilation of source files.

 Digital's Extensions to OSF/Motif

 Digital provides added value to the standard OSF/Motif toolkit. Dig-
 ital ships a library that includes a set of Digital developed widgets
 and runtime routines that are not available from OSF. The widgets pro-
 vide a common DECwindows interface for some commonly used DECwindows
 functions. The widgets provided include:

 o  A Color Mix widget that enables users to select and mix colors us-
    ing a variety of color models

                                  7

 

 o  A Compound String Text widget that provides support for interna-
    tional right-to-left character sets as well as left-to-right writ-
    ing directions

 o  A Help widget that allows applications to display appropriate help
    text in a consistent manner

 o  A Print widget that allows applications to print files in a con-
    sistent manner

 o  A Structured Visual Navigation (SVN) widget used by applications
    to display hierarchical information

 The runtime routines provided include:

 o  Three DECwindows Help System calls that enable users to display on-
    line help files using Bookreader.

 o  Linkworks Services that allow applications to easily participate
    in the Linkworks Environment. These services provide generic user
    interface and information object manipulation capabilities for man-
    aging Linkworks Objects. Using the Linkworks Services, an appli-
    cation can:

    -  Augment its user interface by adding the Linkworks navigation
       capabilities

    -  Create, copy, and delete Linkworks Objects

    -  Set and retrieve the values of the properties of Linkworks Ob-
       jects - properties may have one or more values of a number of
       different types (integer, boolean, floating point, date, char-
       acter string, DDIF string, and LWK object)

    -  Perform property value based queries on the Links or Surrogates
       contained in Linknets, and the Steps or Surrogates contained in
       Paths

    -  Store and retrieve Linkworks Objects in Linkworks linkbases (per-
       sistent storage)

                                  8

 

 o  DECimage runtime support for applications developed using DECim-
    age Application Services. This support includes the Image Services
    Library, Image Display Services and X Image Extensions.

 X User Interface (XUI) Programming Support

 VMS DECwindows Motif continues to provide the XUI Toolkit. The XUI Toolkit
 is based on the MIT R4 Xtoolkit intrinsics. This toolkit implements
 the XUI user interface style used by previous versions of VMS DECwin-
 dows. However, new applications should be written to OSF/Motif as Mo-
 tif is the open standard user interface adopted by a wide variety of
 vendors.

 Porting Tools

 Digital provides XUI-to-Motif porting tools to aid programmers in port-
 ing applications to Motif. These tools replace occurrences of XUI names
 in the input source file with the correct Motif names.

 Compound Document Architecture (CDA) Programming Support

 The CDA Toolkit provides access routines that applications can use to
 create, read, and write files containing compound text, graphics, and
 imaging data. These files provide a vehicle for recording this infor-
 mation on disk, a medium for interchange of this data between appli-
 cations, and an intermediate form from which high-resolution print-
 able graphics data can be generated.

 Enhanced X Windows Display PostScript (XDPS)

 The Display PostScript System provided with VMS DECwindows Motif ex-
 tends the native X graphical programming environment for DECwindows
 users displaying text or images on workstations that support the XDPS
 extension.

 X Display PostScript adds the following capabilities to the basic X11
 environment:

 o  All DECwindows fonts can be displayed at any size and rotation an-
    gle.

                                  9

 

 o  XDPS graphics are specified in a user-defined coordinate system in-
    dependent of monitor density.

 o  Color or gray-scale rendition is automatically modified to take ad-
    vantage of the monitor type through either direct display, color
    dithering, or half-toning.

 o  DPS Display routines can be downloaded to the server and executed
    on command.

 o  Sophisticated graphics primitives, such as precisely controlled Bezier
    curves, can be displayed.

 o  Any display can be scaled and rotated arbitrarily.

 Programming access to XDPS is through the Adobe Client Library. In ad-
 dition, a converter called pswrap allows users to convert PostScript
 code into C programs that can be called from other languages.

 Display Server Extension Support

 The VMS DECwindows Motif Display Server supports the following exten-
 sions:

 o  Display PostScript: "Adobe-DPS-Extension" as defined jointly by Adobe
    Systems, Incorporated and Digital and registered with the MIT X Con-
    sortium. Allows the display server to execute PostScript commands
    to support the XDPS programming environment.

 o  Phigs Extension to X: "X3D_PEX" as defined by the MIT X Consortium.
    Allows the Display Server to provide 3D hardware support for DEC
    PHIGS, the Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System.

 o  X Imaging Extension: "Xie" as defined by the MIT X Consortium. Al-
    lows the Display Server to provide hardware or software support for
    imaging operations for ISL, the image services library.

 o  XTRAP: "DEC-XTRAP" as defined by Digital and registered with the
    MIT X Consortium. Allows the display service to provide support for
    hands-off testing programs like DTM, the DEC Test Manager.

                                 10

 

 o  Multi-Buffering: "Multi-Buffering" as defined by the MIT X Consor-
    tium. Allows the display server to provide support for multiply-
    buffered images.
