          PRODUCT NAME:  VAX-11 RSX, Version 2.5              SPD 26.73.07

          DESCRIPTION

          Overview

          VAX-11 RSX is an emulator of the RSX Operating System family
          which executes on all VAX systems. VAX-11 RSX runs in compati-
          bility mode on processors that support a PDP-11 instruction set
          subset in hardware or microcode, and also runs on processors
          without this support by providing its own software emulation of
          the same PDP-11 instruction set subset.

          VAX-11 RSX provides special capabilities which enable PDP-
          11 users to develop programs for execution in the following
          environments:

          o  VMS compatibility mode (hardware-supported or software-
             emulated)

          o  RSX-11M-PLUS

          o  RSX-11M

          o  RSX-11S

          o  Micro/RSX

          o  VAX CoProcessor/RSX

          VAX-11 RSX also allows for the migration of many existing RSX
          applications to VMS.

          VAX-11 RSX, Version 2.5                             SPD 26.73.07



          The program development facilities provided by VAX-11 RSX con-
          sist of the following:

          o  PDP-11 Instruction Set Emulator (CEM$EMULATOR) which emulates
             the PDP-11 machine instruction set and allows RSX tasks to
             run on VAX processors that do not contain the compatibility
             mode hardware.

          o  MCR command line interpreter (CLI) which emulates the RSX
             MCR CLI so users may interact with a familiar user interface.
             MCR also provides access to many of the native VMS program
             development facilities.

          o  RSX Application Migration Executive (AME) which emulates the
             RSX Executive services.

          o  Indirect Command File Processor (ICM) which allows RSX indi-
             rect command files to be executed on VMS.

          o  DCL command back translator (BACKTRANS) which allows RSX
             utilities to be invoked through the use of the DCL command
             interface.

          o  A subset of the RSX program development utilities and li-
             braries.

          o  A subset of the RMS-11, Version 2.0 program development
             utilities and libraries.

          The following RSX program development utilities are available to
          users of VAX-11 RSX:

          o  BRU - Backup and Restore Utility (ODS-1 only).

             Note: BRU can restore files to an ODS-2 volume. However,
             files on an ODS-2 volume cannot be read by BRU for backup or
             verify operations.

          o  CRF - Cross Reference Processor

          o  DMP - File Dump Utility

          o  EDI - Line Text Editor

          The following utilities for file transfer to and from RSX family

          o  DTE - Data Terminal Emulator Utility

          o  MFT - File Transfer Utility

             Note: MFT has superseded the Professional File Transfer
             Program (PFT) formerly included in the Professional Host
             Communications product.

          General Access

          VAX-11 RSX users gain access to the system through the normal
          VMS LOGINOUT procedure. They may explicitly request MCR as their
          CLI, or they may have MCR as their default CLI by having it
          specified in the User Authorization File.

                                          4

 


          VAX-11 RSX, Version 2.5                             SPD 26.73.07



          Alternatively, VAX-11 RSX users may use the DCL CLI. Under
          DCL, not all of the RSX and RMS program development utilities
          are directly available. Some of the utilities are available
          through DCL commands (e.g., LIBRARY/RSX-11), but for some other
          utilities, the user must explicitly request the utility to
          execute by typing either RUN SYS$SYSTEM:utility-name or MCR
          utility-name.

          VAX-11 RSX indirect command files may be executed from either
          MCR or DCL, but must contain only indirect directives and MCR
          commands.

          On VMS, it is only possible to switch from one CLI to another by
          logging out of the current CLI and then logging in again using
          the new CLI, or by using the DCL or MCR SPAWN command. This
          differs from RSX-11M and RSX-11M-PLUS.

          Operations With Disk and Tape Volumes

          In addition to a native disk file structure (Files-11 Structure
          Level 2), VMS provides a disk file structure (called Files-
          11 Structure Level 1) that is compatible with RSX Systems.
          This provides for easy cross migration of code and data. Both
          file structures are available to programs running in either
          compatibility or native mode. However, not all features of
          Files-11 Structure Level 2 are available to programs running
          in compatibility mode.

          Note: Files-11 Structure Level 1 (ODS-1) disks cannot be shared
          between nodes in a cluster.

          VAX-11 RSX supports general access to magnetic tape volumes.
          In addition, tapes created on an RSX system by BRU, FLX, PIP,
          and RMS BCK can all be read on VAX-11 RSX by corresponding
          utilities. Similarly, it is possible to create tapes on VAX-11
          RSX to be read on an RSX system.

          VAX-11 RSX, Version 2.5                             SPD 26.73.07



          VAX-11 RSX includes support for the RSX Data Terminal Emulator
          (DTE) and File Transfer (MFT) utilities. These utilities provide
          for two-way file transfer to and from RSX family systems and
          other VMS Systems which are running VAX-11 RSX. In this manner,
          files of any type or size can be transferred by means of a
          serial line in either direction from one system to the other.
          The file transfer can be initiated from either system using the
          DTE utility available on that system.

          DECnet is not available to RSX programs executing under VAX-
          11 RSX with one exception: applications written to use RMS-11,
          Version 2.0 will have access to DECnet.

          Compatibility

          VAX-11 RSX is an emulator of the RSX family of operating sys-
          tems. Specifically, this product is designed to emulate:

          o  RSX-11M-PLUS, V4.3

          o  Micro/RSX, V4.3

          o  RSX-11M, V4.6

          o  RSX-11S, V4.6

          Indirect Command File Compatibility

          All indirect command file directives and functions are supported
          to some extent except .FORM, .WAIT, and .XQT. Most RSX indirect
          command files can be executed successfully on VAX-11 RSX.

          The following system generations and network generations are
          specifically supported:

          o  RSX-11M-PLUS V4.3

          o  RSX-11M V4.6

          o  RSX-11S V4.6

          o  DECnet-11M-PLUS V4.3

          o  DECnet-11M V4.5

          o  DECnet-11S V4.5

          Note:  The MicroVAX II and VAXstation II are NOT recommended
                 for RSX system generations or DECnet network generations
                 due to the performance characteristics of the PDP-11
                 instruction set emulator on these processors.

          Other Areas of Compatibility

          VAX-11 RSX also supports the following features:

          o  Memory Resident Overlays

          o  Cluster Libraries

          o  FCSRES

          o  RMSRES

          General Areas of Incompatibility

          Every effort has been made to make the functions this product
          supports as compatible as possible with the RSX environment
          given the constraints of the VMS Operating System environment.
          However, certain areas of incompatibility do exist in this
          product and may continue to exist in future versions. The few
          areas of incompatibility mentioned in the various sections of
          this Software Product Description (SPD) are not guaranteed to be
          all inclusive.

          Other areas where incompatibilities exist include:

          o  No support for supervisor mode libraries

          o  No support for I-and-D space separation

          Compatibility with Other Derivatives of RSX

          No compatibility is expressed or otherwise implied with any
          other versions of the RSX family of operating systems or related
          operating systems, except where specifically noted.
