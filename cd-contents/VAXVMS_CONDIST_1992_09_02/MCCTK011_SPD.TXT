     PRODUCT NAME:  DECmcc Developer's Toolkit, Version 1.1       SPD
     32.49.01

     DESCRIPTION

     The DECmcc Developer's Toolkit is a VMS layered product used
     for the development of application-specific DECmcc access mod-
     ules. The development tools run on any VAX computer under the
     VMS Operating System. The DECmcc Developer's Toolkit is for
     experienced network managers and system software developers.

     The DECmcc Director or Basic Management System software is re-
     quired for enrolling, testing and operating management modules
     developed using the Toolkit. The DECmcc system software sim-
     plifies the design and implementation of application-specific
     modules by offering a runtime kernel executive, various service
     programs, and source code for a Sample Access Module.

     The Toolkit includes documentation and several software develop-
     ment utilities and testing tools.

     Documentation

     The DECmcc Developer's Toolkit documentation provides informa-
     tion to assist in the design and development of access modules.
     It includes the following documents:

     o  Enterprise Management Architecture General Description

     o  EMA Entity Modeling

     o  The DECmcc System Reference Manual

     o  DECmcc Management Module Programming

     o  The DECmcc Developer's Toolkit Reference

     The DECmcc Module Reference, available on-line only, provides
     specifications of the services offered and required by each
     DECmcc management module.

     Development Utilities/Tools

     DECmcc Design Framework

     The DECmcc Design framework is a set of generic software compo-
     nents, including a modular and extensible starter access mod-
     ule. The starter access module may be used to build a starter
     application-specific access module. The Design framework uses
     proven development techniques that minimize coding errors, expe-
     dite development, and reduce coding ambiguities that can arise
     during the course of access module design.

     Management Specification Language (MSL)

     The MSL Translator Utility translates application-specific
     management specification information into input suitable for
     the DECmcc dictionary administrator program (DAP).

     The following utilities are included in the DECmcc Director and
     Basic Management System software and are necessary for enrolling
     application-specific access modules and related files into the
     DECmcc system.

     o  Dictionary Administrator Program (DAP) Utility

     o  Parse Table Builder (PTB) Utility

     o  Test Bed Driver (TBD) Utility

     o  Help File Builder (HFB) Utility

     These utilities allow on-site enrollment of access modules. The
     DECmcc Developer's Toolkit Reference (AA-PD5MA-TE) describes
     each utility in detail.
