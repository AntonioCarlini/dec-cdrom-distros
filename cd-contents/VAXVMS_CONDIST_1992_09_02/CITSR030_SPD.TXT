           PRODUCT NAME:  DEC Computer Integrated Telephony   SPD 29.91.04
                          Server for VMS, Version 3.0

           DESCRIPTION

           DEC Computer Integrated Telephony (DEC CIT) Server for VMS
           is a software product which provides functional integration
           between Digital Equipment Corporation's computing environ-
           ment and a CIT-compatible PBX.

           DEC CIT Server for VMS adds support for:

           o  The ASAI protocol for the AT&T[R] DEFINITY[R] Generic 1 (G1)
              PBX

           o  Digital's implementation of the draft ECMA CSTA proto-
              col

           o  Digital's multi-line DECvoice hardware (DTCN5/DTCO5)

           DEC CIT Server for VMS continues support for:

           o  The HCI protocol on Mitel's SX2000[TM] PBX

           o  The Meridian Link[TM] (ISDN/AP) protocol on the North-
              ern Telecom Meridian[TM] 1 PBX

           o  The ACL/H protocol on the Siemens' HICOM[TM] 300 series
              PBXs

           DEC CIT Server for VMS also supports communication with one
           or more DECvoice DTC04 modules (North American version only).

           Access to the CIT Server is through the DEC Computer Inte-
           grated Telephony Applications Interface (CIT Applications
           Interface). DEC CIT Applications Interface provides program-
           mers with an applications interface comprising a library of

           routines. These routines allow the applications programmer
           to establish and control logical communications channels be-
           tween a CIT client and a PBX. These channels can be used for
           basic call processing such as making and accepting telephone
           calls, and additional call processing such as transfer and
           conference calls.

           The CIT Applications Interface routines also allow the pro-
           grammer to establish communications channels with one or more
           DECvoice modules installed on a CIT server. Through the CIT
           interface, a DECvoice module provides a voice response unit
           that can be used for voice digitization (for example, record-
           ing messages over a telephone), independent voice recogni-
           tion, and voice synthesis which converts text messages to
           speech.

           The CIT Server software resides on a VAX host. For PBX func-
           tions, the VAX must be connected to a CIT-compatible PBX by
           means of a synchronous communications link (Basic Rate In-
           terface for the link to AT&T's switch). The CIT Server soft-
           ware communicates with the CIT-compatible PBX and the CIT
           Applications Interface client nodes. It acts as an inter-
           mediary, passing messages between the PBX and the CIT Ap-
           plications Interfaces. For voice applications, one or more
           DECvoice modules must be installed on the CIT server node.
           The DECvoice hardware can be either the analog DTC04 option
           or the digital DTCN5/DTC05 options.

           INSTALLATION

           Only experienced customers should attempt installation of
           this product. Digital recommends that all other customers
           purchase Digital's Installation Services. These services pro-
           vide for installation of the software product by an expe-
           rienced Digital Software Specialist.

           If one or more DECvoice modules are required, the modules
           should be installed before the CIT Server software. The DECvoice
           system should be installed either by experienced customers
           or by Digital's Installation Services. For more information,
           refer to the DECvoice Software Software Product Description
           (SPD 29.97.xx).

           In addition, if the link to a PBX is required and the cus-
           tomer is not experienced with installing a CIT-compatible
           PBX, the customer should consult their PBX distributor.

           HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

           Systems, components and peripherals as specified in the Sys-
           tem Support Addendum (SSA 29.91.04-x).

           For a link to a PBX, users must have a CIT-compatible PBX
           configured to support the particular PBX link protocol. Sup-
           port of voice functions requires one or more DECvoice mod-
           ules.

           SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

           o  VMS Operating System.

           o  DECnet-VAX (end-node or full function node license) if
              more than one VAX is part of the configuration.

           o  VAX Wide Area Network (WAN) Device Drivers.

           o  DEC CIT Applications Interface must be installed either
              on the same node as the DEC CIT Server software or on an-
              other node linked to the CIT Server host by DECnet.

           Note: The WAN Device Drivers Software is required if con-
           necting the Server to any PBX other than the AT&T DEFINITY.
           It is not required for accessing the DECvoice functions.

           The DEC CIT Server software can support multiple CIT Appli-
           cation Interfaces over DECnet.

           *  Refer to the System Support Addendum (SSA 29.91.04-x) for
              availability and required versions of prerequisite/optional
              software.
