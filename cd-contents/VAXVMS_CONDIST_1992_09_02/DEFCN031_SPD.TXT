 PRODUCT NAME:  DECconcentrator 500 Software Microcode, Version 3.1 SPD
 32.29.05

 DESCRIPTION

 DECconcentrator 500 Software Microcode is dedicated Microcode that runs
 in the DECconcentrator 500 hardware platform (DEFCN-AA, -AB, -AC, -
 AD, -BA, -BB, -BC, -BD). The Microcode is stored in electrically al-
 terable ROM that resides in the DEFCN-Ax, -Bx hardware platform and
 is maintained over power outages and system resets. The DECconcentra-
 tor 500 hardware platform is designed to comply with the ANSI X3T9 FDDI
 Standard.

 The DECconcentrator 500 hardware platform can be configured to suit
 specific customer application and cable plant requirements. It sup-
 ports management modules with Dual-Attachment-Station (DAS) ports ("A"
 and "B" ports), which can directly connect to an FDDI dual ring, as
 well as support for several multi-port module options (with SAS "M"
 Ports) to connect devices via the concentrator to the FDDI dual ring.
 Depending on the option selected, there is support for several media
 types including Multimode Fiber (MMF), Single-Mode Fiber (SMF), Shielded
 Twisted-Pair (STP), and ThinWire coax (TW). Both Digital and non-Digital
 FDDI devices, such as workstations, servers, systems, bridges, etc.,
 can be connected to FDDI dual ring networks via the concentrator.

 The DECconcentrator 500 hardware platform is shipped from the factory
 with the DECconcentrator 500 Software Microcode preloaded and can be
 updated via downline load when new versions of the Microcode are is-
 sued.

 General characteristics of the DECconcentrator 500 Software Microcode
 are:

 o  Performs initialization and module bootstrapping.

 o  Performs diagnostic selftest automatically at power-up and also when
    initiated by network management software.

 o  Performs FDDI Station Management (SMT) based on the evolving ANSI
    X3T9 Standard, SMT V6.2.

 o  Holds and updates all the DECconcentrator 500 counters and settable
    parameters.

 o  Supports reception, processing and transmission of remote network
    management packets generated by network management software uti-
    lizing SNMP (including simple sets), RBMS, MOP, or SMT protocols
    (requires a Management Module DEFCN-MA, -MB, -MF, -MH, -CA, -CF,
    -DA, -DF, -EA, -EF).

 o  Supports downline load of new firmware when initiated via MOP for
    upgrades (requires a Management Module DEFCN-MA, -MB, -MF, -MH, -
    CA, -CF, -DA, -DF, -EA, -EF).

 o  Supports both fiber optic and copper media port modules:

 o  Provides a Ring Purger algorithm to eliminate no-owner frames (can
    be disabled and enabled via network management).

 o  Provides Out-of-Band-Management (OBM) support via an ASCII Termi-
    nal port on the DEFCN-AC, -AD and DEFCN-BC, -BD hardware platforms
    (does not include modem control). When required, remote dial-in can
    be accomplished by adding a "smart modem."

 o  Provides for the control of third-party Optical-Bypass-Relays (OBR)
    connected via the DEFCN-MB, -MH Management Modules.
