           PRODUCT NAME:  VAX Message Router X.400 Gateway,   SPD 27.50.04
                          Version 2.2

           DESCRIPTION

           VAX Message Router X.400 Gateway (MRX) is a network server
           layered software product that resides on a VMS system pro-
           viding interconnection between MAILbus, Digital Equipment
           Corporation's Message Router based electronic message trans-
           fer service and a CCITT 1984 X.400 Message Handling System.
           Together, VAX Message Router X.400 Gateway and VAX Message
           Router (MR) form a Message Transfer Agent conforming to the
           CCITT 1984 X.400 Series of Recommendations for Message Han-
           dling Systems, and can act as either a Private Management
           Domain (private messaging network) or an Administration Man-
           agement Domain (public messaging network).

           The MRX Gateway allows users of systems connected to MAIL-
           bus, for example user agents such as ALL-IN-1 MAIL or ALL-IN-1
           Integrated Office System, to communicate with users of X.400
           Message Handling Systems. Users of systems connected through
           other gateways to MAILbus can also access the MRX Gateway
           and systems connected through it. The MRX Gateway can be con-
           nected to an X.400 Gateway from another system vendor, to
           an X.400 Private Management Domain or to an X.400 Adminis-
           tration Management Domain. Applications such as DEC/EDI (Dig-
           ital's Electronic Data Interchange) software can also use
           MRX as a connection to public and private networks.

           The VAX Message Router X.400 Gateway interworks with sys-
           tems that conform to the CCITT X.400 1984 recommendations
           as defined in the profiles produced by:

           o  CEPT (profile A/311 for administration domains)

                                    DIGITAL            November 1991

                                                         AE-JA36E-TE

 



           VAX Message Router X.400 Gateway, Version 2. 2   SPD 27.50.04


           o  CEN/CENELEC (profile A/3211 for private domains)

           o  NIST/X.400

           These profiles are not uniform and where differences exist,
           the product follows the NIST profile. Some restrictions on
           the level of service obtained between message originator and
           recipient may apply if all the systems involved in the mes-
           sage transfer do not conform with the X.400 Recommendations.

           The MRX Gateway provides translation and conversion services
           between the NIST/NBS protocols and service elements of MAIL-
           bus and those specified by the X.400 Recommendations. Mes-
           sage content conversion is also performed by MRX. Digital's
           WPS-PLUS, DECdx, ASCII and DDIF (Digital Document Interchange
           Format) Text document formats are converted to IA5 or Tele-
           tex formats when passed from the MAILbus to the X.400 net-
           work. IA5 or Teletex documents received from the X.400 net-
           work are passed into MAILbus as ASCII text files.

           With the addition of Digital's ODA Compound Document Archi-
           tecture (CDA) Gateway for VMS (SPD 32.10.xx), a set of doc-
           ument conversion routines which reconcile Digital's Compound
           Document Architecture (CDA) and the ISO Office Document Ar-
           chitecture (ODA), DDIF documents can be passed into the X.400
           network as ODA Bodypart (Tag 12) messages; as defined in the
           NIST Stable Implementation Agreements for Open Systems In-
           terconnection Protocols, Version 3, 1989. In the reverse di-
           rection, ODA documents are converted into DDIF format for
           onward transmission through MAILbus.

           The MRX Gateway also supports the transmission and receipt
           of binary bodyparts using the Binary Data Bodypart (Tag 14)
           feature described in the CCITT X.400 1988 recommendations
           and the NIST Stable Implementation Agreements for Open Sys-
           tems Interconnection Protocols, Version 3, 1989.

           The VAX Message Router X.400 Gateway is designed to conform
           with US GOSIP, Version 1.0 and UK GOSIP, Version 3.1.

           The Directory Service (DDS), part of VAX Message Router, is
           used for address translation between X.400 Originator/Recipient
           (O/R) Names and MAILbus addresses when messages are trans-
           ferred to or from the X.400 network. This directory is also
           used to authorize originators of outgoing messages to the
           X.400 network.

           The MRX Gateway may use either an X.25 wide area network link
           or an IEEE 802.3/ISO 8802-3/Ethernet local area network to
           communicate with:

           o  Another X.400 Gateway (back-to-back) within the same net-
              work

           o  Another vendor's X.400 MTA within the same network

           o  A private domain (from a private or administration do-
              main)

           o  An administration domain (from a private or administra-
              tion domain)

           To provide connection to MAILbus, the VAX Message Router soft-
           ware is required by and included with the software license
           and media kit for VAX Message Router X.400 Gateway.

           INSTALLATION

           MRX forms only one part of a distributed multi-vendor elec-
           tronic messaging application. Important activities, such as
           coordination with other messaging components, modification
           of OSI network parameters, and the creation or update of sub-
           scriber entries in the directory service, must precede the
           installation of this product. Digital offers a number of ser-
           vices to assist customers with these tasks. Refer to the SOFT-
           WARE PRODUCT SERVICES section for more information.

           A customer's first purchase of this product should include
           Digital Installation Services. For subsequent purchases of
           this product only experienced customers should attempt in-
           stallation. Digital recommends that all other customers pur-
           chase Digital's Installation Services. These services pro-
           vide for installation of the software product by an expe-
           rienced Digital Software Specialist.
