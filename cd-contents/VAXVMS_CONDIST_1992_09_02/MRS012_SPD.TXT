           PRODUCT NAME:  VAX Message Router/S Gateway,    SPD 29.24.02
			  Version, 1.2

           DESCRIPTION

           VAX Message Router/S Gateway (MRS) is a network server lay-
           ered software product that resides on VAX/VMS systems pro-
           viding interconnection between MAILbus, Digital Equipment
           Corporation's Message Router based electronic message trans-
           fer service, and IBM[R]'s Systems Network Architecture Dis-
           tribution Services (SNADS). Through MRS, users of Digital
           office automation systems such as ALL-IN-1 MAIL Server or
           ALL-IN-1 Integrated Office System can send and receive mes-
           sages, documents, notes, and binary files (for example, MS-DOS[R]
           files) to and from users of IBM office systems, such as Per-
           sonal Services/370.

           VAX Message Router/S Gateway provides both address and con-
           tent conversion for messages and documents passed between
           the Digital and IBM office networks. In this way, users are
           not required to learn new commands or procedures except the
           new addresses representing the users of the other network(s)
           with whom they can now communicate by means of MRS. MRS con-
           nects to an IBM DISOSS system, which contains the host im-
           plementation of SNADS. Other SNADS nodes have access to the
           Digital network through their SNA connections to that IBM
           host. No Digital software is required to be installed on the
           IBM system to accomplish these transfers. With some restric-
           tions, MRS allows users of those IBM office systems to com-
           municate through MAILbus to other networks including pub-
           lic messaging services.

           VAX Message Router/S Gateway, Version 1.2   SPD 29.24.02


           Message address conversion is accomplished through the Di-
           rectory Service (DDS) function of Message Router. Each Dig-
           ital user sending and receiving mail to and from IBM users
           must be registered in DDS and assigned an "alias" or vir-
           tual address for the SNADS network. Limited one way message
           transfer from MAILbus to IBM is possible without user reg-
           istration in DDS. The recipient (addressee) list of a sin-
           gle message and stored distribution lists can include both
           Digital and IBM users. Delivery Confirmation and Non-Delivery
           Notification messages are supported.

           During MRS configuration, a number of options for message
           content conversion may be chosen on a per-gateway basis. To
           preserve maximum revisable content, messages and documents
           from the Digital network can be converted to IBM's DCA Re-
           visable Format. Where users of IBM systems only have access
           to simple text editors, conversions can be made to IBM's DCA
           Final Format or to DISOSS Note format. Digital text messages
           with one or more attached text documents are concatenated
           into a single document for transfer to the SNADS network.
           Not all attachments to mixed contents messages will be sent
           to SNADS.

           Binary non-text file types, identified in the Digital net-
           work as DECbodypart 7 (FOREIGN) or DECbodypart 11 (MS-DOS),
           will be transferred unconverted to the IBM SNADS network.
           Such files, sent from a Digital to an IBM SNADS network, will
           lose their Digital RMS attributes. Binary file transfer is
           primarily intended for the transfer of MS-DOS files between
           the Digital and IBM networks. Files tagged as DCA files (for
           example, a document produced on a PC word processing sys-
           tem) can be identified in the SNADS network as a DCA doc-
           ument. Not all Digital User Agents and Gateways can append
           these tags to DECbodypart 7 or DECbodypart 11 files. Only
           one binary file may be passed to the IBM environment at a
           time; any attachments to these files will be lost. These con-
           version options are chosen during MRS configuration.

           and functions are converted. The MRS product documentation
           lists the restrictions. Users are responsible for understand-
           ing the capabilities of destination systems when sending bi-
           nary files. Binary file transfer should not be used with ALL-IN-1
           Integrated Office System, Version 2.2 or earlier or VMSmail
           Personal Mail Utility of the VMS Operating System, Version
           5.1 or earlier.

           A single MRS installation will support messaging services
           between a SNADS network of IBM office systems and a MAIL-
           bus network of Digital VMS systems and between the SNADS net-
           work and any other messaging network connected to that MAIL-
           bus. Service levels obtained in the latter case will depend
           on the characteristics of this other network.

           To provide connection to MAILbus, the VAX Message Router soft-
           ware is required by and included with the software license
           and media kit for VAX Message Router/S Gateway.

           INSTALLATION

           MRS forms only one part of a distributed multi-vendor elec-
           tronic messaging application. Important activities, such as
           coordination with other messaging components, modification
           of the IBM system parameters and the creation or update of
           subscriber entries in the directory service, must precede
           the installation of this product. Digital offers a number
           of services to assist customers with these tasks. Refer to
           the SOFTWARE PRODUCT SERVICES section of this SPD for more
           information.

           Only experienced customers should attempt installation of
           this product. Digital recommends that all other customers
           purchase Digital's Installation Services. These services pro-
           vide for installation of the software product by an expe-
           rienced Digital Software Specialist.

           Digital's Installation Services can be purchased as a sep-
           arate service.

           Customer Responsibilities

           Before Digital installation of the software the customer must:

           o  Previously have installed all prerequisite hardware in-
              cluding terminals.

           o  Obtain, install and demonstrate as operational any modems
              and other equipment and facilities necessary to inter-
              face to Digital's communications equipment.

           o  Demonstrate equivalency of operation for modems other than
              Bell System 201C, 208A or 209A type modems, or, in Eu-
              rope, PTT approved modems.

           o  Have generated, to Digital's satisfaction, any necessary
              IBM host software that will be communicating with the DEC-
              net/SNA Gateway or VMS/SNA and VAX Message Router/S.

           o  Make available for a reasonable period of time, as mu-
              tually agreed by Digital and the customer, all hardware,
              communications facilities, and terminals that are to be
              used during the installation.

           Delays caused by any failure to meet these responsibilities
           will be charged at the prevailing rates for time and mate-
           rials.

           Successful use of this product requires:

           o  The customer must be prepared to work with both Digital
              and IBM systems personnel to coordinate the installation
              activities.

           o  The customer should be capable of modifying IBM compo-
              nent generation parameters to support the DECnet/SNA Gate-
              way or VMS/SNA and VAX Message Router/S Gateway.

           Absolute fidelity between an original document and the re-
           sulting document as printed or displayed by the receiving
           system is not guaranteed. The differences between vendors'
           approaches to word processing systems, the transformations
