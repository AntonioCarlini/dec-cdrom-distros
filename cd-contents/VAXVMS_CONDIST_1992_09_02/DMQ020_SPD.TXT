 PRODUCT NAME:  DECmessageQ for VMS, Version 2.0        SPD 34.07.01

 DESCRIPTION

 DECmessageQ for VMS is the VMS Operating System implementation of a
 generic software message queuing bus that provides easy-to-use, ef-
 ficient task-to-task communications among processes using DECmessageQ
 on VMS, ULTRIX/RISC, ULTRIX/VAX, MS[R]-DOS[R], OS/2[R], Macintosh[R], HP[R]-UX,
 SYSTEM V/88[R], and Sun[R].

 A common call interface allows messages to be delivered via high-speed
 global sections for some intra-CPU applications, or via DECnet-VAX and
 Transmission Control Protocol/INTERNET Protocol (TCP/IP) for inter-
 CPU applications. Applications can be designed so client applications
 can be redeployed easily anywhere within the DECmessageQ network con-
 figuration, whether in a standalone node, a Local Area Network (LAN),
 or a Wide Area Network (WAN).

 The DECmessageQ communication implementation is designed for ease-of-
 use, expandability, and efficiency.

 Features

 o  High speed local message delivery using Global Sections

 o  Remote message delivery via DECnet for MS-DOS, Macintosh, OS/2, and
    VMS connections; and via TCP/IP for UNIX[R]/ULTRIX and VMS connec-
    tions.

 o  Fully asynchronous and synchronous receipt of messages

 o  Message sizes up to 32,000 bytes

 o  Priority queuing of messages

 o  Message recovery using Message Recovery Services (MRS)

 DECmessageQ for VMS can also be used as an integration tool to merge
 many external events with the Message Queuing Bus. In addition to in-
 tegrating messages from local processes and remote processes, DECmessageQ
 also provides facilities for the integration of other events such as:

                                  2

 

    Timer settings
    Simulated messages
    LU6.2 conversations
    Other external events such as special hardware I/O

 DECmessageQ Queues

 DECmessageQ for VMS provides three types of queues. A queue is a mem-
 ory storage location for DECmessageQ messages. Any process can insert
 a message into any queue. These queues are accessed directly by DECmes-
 sageQ procedures. These procedures are called by user-written appli-
 cations. DECmessageQ queue types are:

 o  Primary Queue (PQ) - Each process that attaches to the message queu-
    ing bus is assigned a Primary Queue. This queue is used to receive
    messages from processes using DECmessageQ.

 o  Secondary Queue (SQ) - Any process may attach to one or more sec-
    ondary queues. These queues can also be used to receive messages.
    The order in which queues are scanned for messages is defined by
    the DECmessageQ selection rules.

 o  Multi-Reader Queue (MRQ) - A Multi-Reader Queue is a single shared
    queue that can be shared by multiple processes.

 Message Recovery Services (MRS)

 Message Recovery Services for the DECmessageQ Message Queuing Bus ex-
 tend data recovery to the level of pending messages. Using Message Re-
 covery Services, the sender is relieved of the responsibility of track-
 ing the progress of a message through its next level of processing.
 This functionality can be used both at the client and server sides of
 the application.

 Message Recovery Services increase the robustness of DECmessageQ by
 providing applications with the ability to recover from message de-
 livery failures due to:

    Application program abort
    Communication line failure
    System crash

 Some of the applications requirements addressed by MRS are:

 o  Sender wishes to insure delivery of messages when the receiving pro-
    cess is available but does not wish to monitor the delivery.

                                  4

 

 o  Sender wishes to know that a message is recoverable to avoid the
    cost of reconstructing it but does not care when it is finally de-
    livered.

 o  Receiver wishes to maintain a journal of all messages received by
    it for audit trail or reprocessing.

 Message Recovery Services are primarily implemented by an MRS server,
 a non-privileged program attached to the DECmessageQ Message Bus. MRS
 actions are invoked by standard DECmessageQ send and receive message
 calls.

 MRS is oriented toward messages, not processes; not all messages sent
 from or directed to a particular process need to be processed by MRS.
 This allows applications to selectively incur the additional process-
 ing imposed by MRS for just those messages that are not easily recov-
 ered. Message recovery characteristics are set by the sending process.

 Selective Broadcast Services (SBS)

 There are two important application requirements handled by this ser-
 vice. The first requirement is the ability to send a message to many
 targets without going through multiple application DECmessageQ send
 message requests. The second requirement is the ability to generate
 broadcast messages without the originator knowing the quantity or lo-
 cation of the target process(es).

 Selective Broadcast Services provide a conceptual broadcast stream of
 data. In this broadcast stream any process can insert a message. Any
 process can select messages from this broadcast stream for delivery.
 Messages may be selected using a set of rules that provide relational
 comparisons against DECmessageQ header information or user's message
 data information. The Selective Broadcast Services operate in a sin-
 gle server environment or between cooperating DECmessageQ servers. When
 the SBS is operating between nodes, it can operate using DECnet or TCP
 /IP services, or using direct Ethernet operations. In the direct Eth-
 ernet operations, the SBS will optimize message traffic by using Eth-
 ernet's multi-casting capabilities.

 Delivery Options

                                  5

 

 DECmessageQ for VMS provides the following set of delivery options:

 o  Datagram - A non-recoverable attempt is made to deliver a message.
    If the message cannot be delivered to a target, then, an error is
    logged.

 o  Wait for enqueue - The sending process will block until the mes-
    sage is written to the target queue. A return status will indicate
    if the message successfully enqueued to the queue.

 o  Blocking and non-blocking message Store-and-Forward - The sending
    process will send messages stored in a disk file locally, before
    they are sent over any communication link(s).

 o  Blocking and non-blocking message disk queuing - The sending pro-
    cess will send messages that will be delivered to the target's disk
    queue.























                                  6

 

 DECmessageQ Scripts Facility

 The DECmessageQ scripts facility provides a general capability to per-
 form message capture, simulation, and replay.

 o  Capture - DECmessageQ scripts can be used to capture messages sent
    or received from a process. These messages can be displayed on the
    output device or collected in a disk file. The messages are dis-
    played in an ASCII file using the DECmessageQ scripts syntax.

 o  Simulation - A disk file containing DECmessageQ scripts commands
    can be used to simulate message traffic to a process. The commands
    use the DECmessageQ scripts syntax. The process will receive these
    messages after any DECmessageQ queue is scanned for receivable mes-
    sages.

 o  Replay - A replay is the simulation of messages previously captured.

 DECmessageQ LU6.2 Services (License Option)

 DECmessageQ LU6.2 Services for VMS systems allows user programs at-
 tached to a DECmessageQ Message Queuing Bus to request, accept, and
 conduct APPC (Advanced Program-to-Program Communications) conversa-
 tions with programs running under CICS/VS, IMS/VS, and other IBM[R] en-
 vironments over SNA LU6.2 sessions.

 Note: Refer to the DECnet/SNA VMS APPC/LU6.2 Software Product Descrip-
 tion (SPD 26.88.xx) for currently supported environments.

 DECmessageQ LU6.2 Services allows users unfamiliar with SNA communi-
 cations to develop, quickly and easily, applications that operate with
 IBM-based APPC applications. Users are insulated from the details of
 both SNA and APPC. DECmessageQ provides additional insulation between
 the two environments by translating transaction program names known
 to DECmessageQ user programs to names known to the IBM system(s) and
 vice versa.




                                  7

 

 DECmessageQ LU6.2 Services for VMS consists of:

 o  An LU6.2 Server image ("Port Server") that provides connection man-
    agement facilities, isolating the end user from details of SNA-APPC
    communications

 o  A library of predefined DECmessageQ message structures for ease of
    program development

 o  Utilities for managing the LU6.2 Server

 o  Tools for developing user-written LU6.2 Servers

 DECmessageQ LU6.2 Services Limits

 DECmessageQ LU6.2 Services for VMS has the following limits:
 

 Maximum user message  31,982 bytes
 size:

 Maximum number of     256 per Port Server
 active LUs:

 Maximum number of     512 per DECmessageQ LU6.2 Server (user-
 remote                written servers: unlimited)
 Transaction Pro-
 grams:

 DECmessageQ LU6.2 Services Utilities

 DECmessageQ LU6.2 Services for VMS includes a management utility that
 allows a suitably privileged user to start, stop, and configure DECmes-
 sageQ LU6.2 servers and observe their activity (through an event mon-
 itoring facility).

 Users can develop specialized LU6.2 servers by using the DECmessageQ
 LU6.2 Server tool kit. The tool kit consists of a DECmessageQ/VMS User
 Callback (a "user callback" is a special User Exit module) and 21 pre-
 defined DECmessageQ message structures.

                                  8

 

 The LU6.2 Server tool kit gives the user a finer degree of control over
 the APPC environment than the standard DECmessageQ LU6.2 Server. Func-
 tions supported via the tool kit are:

 o  DEFINE_LU

 o  DEFINE_TP

 o  DELETE_LU

 o  ALLOCATE_CONVERSATION

 o  DEALLOCATE_CONVERSATION

 o  REQUEST_CONFIRMATION
