           PRODUCT NAME:  Digital Cartridge Server Component  SPD 33.59.01
                          for VMS, Version 1.1
                                  

           DESCRIPTION

           Digital Cartridge Server Component (DCSC) for VMS provides
           the software front-end interface to the StorageTek[R] 4400 Au-
           tomated Cartridge System (StorageTek ACS). It can be installed
           on either a single VAX computer or a VAXcluster.

           DCSC manages the StorageTek ACS transport assignments to a
           VMS system. This includes managing the allocation of ACS trans-
           ports, locking and unlocking both cartridge and transport
           resources to accommodate user tape function requests, and
           recovering any unused resources (caused by a user mounting
           a tape and logging out before dismounting it).

           When a user requests a tape function such as mount, DCSC checks
           for the existence of the requested cartridge, selects an avail-
           able StorageTek ACS transport, and locks the required re-
           sources. DCSC ensures the tape cartridge is physically loaded
           onto a StorageTek transport and, if requested, executes a
           VMS tape mount function. Once a tape cartridge is mounted,
           DCSC makes it possible for users to request a VMS copy or
           backup function to read data from or send data to the car-
           tridge.

           The DCSC kit includes the following:

           o  DCSC Run-Time Library (RTL) routines - A set of tools that
              let programmers design applications specific to their sys-
              tem and users.

           o  DCSC DCL Interface - Lets users request tape cartridge
              functions (for example, to request a mount of a specific
              tape cartridge) from the VMS DCL interface.

           o  Configuration File Editor - A menu-driven interface that
              lets system managers create the configuration file used
              to describe the transport and ACS environment to DCSC.
              DCSC reads this file when it starts up and uses it to de-
              termine operation, network, and StorageTek transport re-
              source allocations.

           o  DCSC Server - A set of processes that manage user requests
              by allocating StorageTek transport resources to users on
              a VAX computer. It also controls communications between
              the DCSC components and the VMS/ULTRIX Connection soft-
              ware which, in turn, communicate with the StorageTek ACS.

           On a VMS system consisting of a single node, the connection
           to the StorageTek transport for input and output operations
           is made through an HSC40 or HSC70 which is connected to one
           or more TC44-AA or TC44-BA controller boards. This connec-
           tion creates the data path from which tape cartridge data
           is read or written to.

           On a VAXcluster consisting of several nodes, one node called
           the master server node fields requests from the other nodes
           on the VAXcluster, which are called virtual server nodes.

           The following documentation is available:

           o  Digital Cartridge Server Component Installation Guide -
              Explains how to install the DCSC using VMSINSTAL and pro-
              vides a sample installation log file.

           o  Digital Cartridge Server Component System Manager's Guide
              - Describes the DCSC, how it works with the StorageTek
              ACS, configuration tasks, how to use the Configuration
              File Editor system, and DCSC-specific system maintenance
              tasks.

           o  Digital Cartridge Server Component Programmer's Refer-
              ence Guide - Describes the DCSC RTL routines and describes
              how to use them by providing examples of VAX C code frag-
              ments.

           o  Digital Cartridge Server Component User's Reference Guide
              - Summarizes the main functions of the DCSC, highlight-
              ing the functions performed by general users such as mount-
              ing and dismounting tapes. In addition, it describes how
              to use the DCSC cartridge DCL commands.
