DECnet/SNA VMS Printer Emulator, V1.2                         SPD 26.70.05

DESCRIPTION

DECnet/SNA VMS Printer Emulator (PrE) is a VMS layered software product 
that allows suitably configured VMS systems within a DECnet network or 
running VMS/SNA software to receive printable data from IBM (R) host-based 
applications. These applications will originally have been developed to 
produce output for an IBM 3287 printer in system mode that is connected to 
an IBM 3274 cluster controller in a Systems Network Architecture (SNA) 
networking environment. Access from the IBM system to VMS systems is via a 
DECnet/SNA Gateway or VMS/SNA software. 

In an actual IBM 3287 environment, data transfer is one way in nature (from 
host to printer) and generates hard copy. The PrE Access software will 
allow VMS users to direct the received output either to be printed via the 
VMS Print Symbiont or spooled to a disk file.

Features

The following is a summary of functions provided by PrE:

oo   PrE is configured and controlled via a DIGITAL Command Language (DCL) 
    style interface for ease of use.

oo   PrE can accept data in SNA Character String (SCS) format (LU Type 1) 
    and 3270 Data Stream format (LU Type 3).

oo   PrE recognizes the following 3270 Data Stream orders:

    CR 	- Carriage Return
    DUP	- Duplicate (converted to a semicolon)
    EM	- End Message
    EUA	- Erase Unprotected to Address
    FF	- Formfeed
    FM	- Field Mark (converted to an asterisk)
    GE	- Graphics Escape (converted to a hyphen)
    NL	- Newline
    PT	- Program Tab
    RA	- Repeat to Address
    SBA	- Set Buffer Address
    SF	- Start Fields

oo   PrE supports the following 3270 Data Stream commands:

    WRITE
    ERASE/WRITE
    ERASE/WRITE ALTERNATE
    ERASE ALL UNPROTECTED

oo   PrE will recognize the following SNA Character String orders:

    BS	- Backspace
    CR	- Carriage Return
    FF	- Formfeed
    GE	- Graphics Escape (converted to a hyphen)
    HT	- Horizontal Tab
    IRS	- Inter Record Separator
    LF	- Linefeed
    NL	- Newline
    SHF	- Set Horizontal Format
    SVF	- Set Vertical Format
    TRN	- Transparency
    VCS	- Vertical Channel Select
    VT	- Vertical Tab

oo   PrE accepts but ignores the following SNA Character String orders:

    BEL	- Bell
    ENP	- Enable Presentation
    INP	- Inhibit Presentation
    SLD	- Set Line Density

oo   PrE supports the 3287 printer Program Attention (PA1 and PA2) keys and 
    the CANCEL PRINT key using commands entered at the user interface.

oo   PrE does not support the Printer Authorization Matrix feature, and it 
    does not emulate the 3287's REPRINT key function.

oo   PrE supports 1-255 copies of the print job to be printed.

oo   PrE supports a maximum of 128 sessions simultaneously.

oo   PrE supports the ability to submit a print job for another user. The 
    print job will run exactly as if that user submitted the request. 
    Accounting information is logged to that user's account. The user name 
    string can be 1 to 12 characters in length and should be a valid 
    username on the system.

oo   PrE supports multiple form types.  The form type is specified by using 
    either a numeric value or a form name.  These form types can refer to 
    the print image width,   length or type of paper.  Codes for these form 
    types are   installation-defined.

oo   PrE supports the ability to change queue name, forms, number, number of 
    copies, user name and choice of deleting the output stream files 
    without stopping the session.

oo   PrE supports the deletion of output files that are spooled to printers 
    as a user-selectable setting.

oo   PrE provides an option to send an INIT SELF request to the IBM 
    application.

oo   PrE supports LU security through the ability to specify a password for 
    providing additional security to access the LU.  This feature is 
    supported in the DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST, DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT, and 
    VMS/SNA V2.0.

INSTALLATION

For PrE to be DIGITAL supported, the customer must have a DIGITAL supported 
DECnet/SNA Gateway or VMS/SNA configuration.  To have a DIGITAL supported 
DECnet/SNA Gateway configuration, purchase of the Gateway 
Installation/Orientation Service is REQUIRED in conjunction with the 
customer's first purchase of the DECnet/SNA Gateway. Refer to the 
DECnet/SNA Gateway SPDs (SPD 30.15.xx, SPD 29.C6.xx, SPD 29.76.xx) for 
further details.

To have a DIGITAL supported VMS/SNA configuration, purchase of the VMS/SNA 
Installation/Orientation Service is REQUIRED in conjunction with the 
customer's first purchase of VMS/SNA. Refer to the VMS/SNA Software Product 
Description (SPD 27.01.xx) for further details.

Only experienced customers should attempt installation of this product. 
DIGITAL recommends that all other customers purchase DIGITAL's Installation 
Services.  These services provide for installation of the software product 
by an experienced DIGITAL Software Specialist.

Customer Responsibilities

Before DIGITAL installation of the software the customer must:

oo   Have previously installed all requisite hardware including terminals.

oo   Obtain, install, and demonstrate as operational any modems and other 
    equipment and facilities necessary to interface to DIGITAL's 
    communications equipment.

oo   Demonstrate equivalency of operation for modems other than Bell System 
    201C, 208A or 209A, AT&T 2596 or 2556, Dataphone II (2096A, DIGITAL 
    2500, or equivalent) type modems or, in Europe, PTT approved modems.

oo   Have generated, to DIGITAL's satisfaction, any necessary IBM host 
    software that will be communicating with the DECnet/SNA Gateway or 
    VMS/SNA and Printer Emulator.

oo   Make available for a reasonable period of time, as mutually agreed by 
    DIGITAL and the customer, all hardware, communications facilities, and 
    terminals that are to be used during installation.

Delays caused by any failure to meet these responsibilities will be charged 
at the prevailing rate for time and materials.

Successful use of this product requires that:

oo   The customer must be prepared to work with both DIGITAL and IBM systems 
    personnel to coordinate the pre-installation activities.

oo   The customer should be capable of modifying IBM component generation 
    parameters to support either the DECnet/SNA Gateway or VMS/SNA and the 
    Printer Emulator software.
