     PRODUCT NAME:  VAX ISDN, Version 1.1                SPD 31.23.01

     DESCRIPTION

     The VAX ISDN communication software product allows suitably
     configured VMS systems to connect to ISDN networks based on the
     corresponding CCITT recommendations via a Basic Rate Access.
     Connections are established using the circuit-switched access of
     the ISDN networks. Tables 1 and 2 list those public networks on
     which VAX ISDN is supported and tested.

     VAX ISDN is a VMS layered product that provides circuit-switched
     call control functions. This allows data transfers over one
     or two B-channels provided by the ISDN network at a Basic Rate
     Access, using the following protocols:

     o  DECnet-VAX Phase IV:
        VAX ISDN allows using DECnet-VAX "circuits" to remote DECnet
        nodes across the ISDN network.

        Note: A DECnet license is required to communicate with other
        DECnet nodes over such circuits.

     o  VAX P.S.I.:
        VAX ISDN also allows using X.25 network protocol (VAX P.S.I.)
        for communication across the ISDN network.

     o  Specific protocols:
        VAX ISDN also allows using specific network protocols (DDCMP
        and HDLC) for communication across the ISDN network.

     VAX ISDN provides the following functions at the VAX node physi-
     cally connected to the ISDN network:

     o  The ability to support three modes of operation at the con-
        troller level:

        -  Simple mode: Calls are set up and cleared whenever ex-
           plicitly requested either by a system operator or an
           application program.

        -  Authorized mode: The only difference between this mode and
           simple mode is that incoming calls that pass the incoming
           setup information filter are accepted only after they have
           been explicitly authorized by an application program.

        -  Time-cutting mode: To establish a circuit-switched con-
           nection to a predefined destination automatically and to
           minimize circuit usage cost by clearing a communication
           automatically when no user or network management data has
           been transferred for a user-specified length of time.

     o  The ability for user-written programs running under VMS to
        control incoming and outgoing calls. The following program-
        ming languages are supported:

        -  VAX C

        -  VAX Pascal

           An ISDN Network Control Program (ISDN$NCP) is provided
           for management of VAX ISDN. This interface allows es-
           tablishing outgoing calls, specifying ISDN addressing
           information and incoming call filters, accessing statis-
           tical information, requesting options or facilities, and
           performing maintenance functions (such as setting the
           operating mode).

           Problem solving is facilitated by the ability to trace and
           analyze data transferred between the ISDN network and the
           various layers of the VAX ISDN software over the D-channel
           of the Basic Rate Access.

     o  The options and network facilities supported by VAX ISDN vary
        according to the local ISDN network in use. Table 3 lists the
        options that VAX ISDN is capable of supporting.

     Note: A VAX ISDN ACCESS (SPD 31.24.xx) license is required for
     controlling incoming and outgoing calls from remote VMS user
     programs and for managing the VAX ISDN product from a remote
     ISDN Network Control Program.

     INSTALLATION

     Digital recommends that a customer's first purchase of this
     software product include Digital Installation Services. These
     services provide for installation of the software product by an
     experienced Digital Software Specialist.

     Customer Responsibilities

     In some cases, the ISDN network supplier imposes restrictions,
     limitations, or requirements on the proposed Digital network
     configuration, options, and facilities. The customer must under-
     stand and adhere to these requirements for each and every ISDN
     network used.

     Before installation of the software, the customer must:

     o  Previously have installed all requisite software and hard-
        ware, including terminals.

     Digital's Installation Services also require that the customer
     must:

     o  Have an ISDN Basic Rate Access (SO) line already installed.

     o  Make available for a reasonable period of time, as mutually
        agreed by Digital and the customer, all hardware, communi-
        cation facilities, and terminals that are to be used during
        installation.

     Options and Facility Support

     VAX ISDN support for any given ISDN option or facility depends
     on support for it in the corresponding ISDN network. Generally,
     VAX ISDN is designed to include restrictions on the use of
     options or network facilities and prevents the use of facilities
     not supported by the local ISDN network.

     Therefore, Table 3 shows what VAX ISDN is capable of using,
     rather than what it will do when used on any particular ISDN
     network. The product documentation describes specific options,
     restrictions, and facilities available for the supported public
     ISDN networks.
