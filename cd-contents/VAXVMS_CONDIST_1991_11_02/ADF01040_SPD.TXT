PRODUCT NAME:  ADF01/VMS Subroutine Library, Version 4.0          SPD 26.61.02
               (for VMS Operating Systems)


DESCRIPTION: 

The ADF01/VMS Subroutine Library provides the user with a simple FORTRAN
interface to the ADF01-B Analogue-to-Digital Converter. 

The ADF01-B is a high speed, multichannel Analogue-to-Digital Converter. It
is connected to a UBA (UNIBUS adapter) via  the DRE11-C or to Q-bus (MicroVAX
II) via the DRQ11-C. 

The device has 16 single ended or 8 differential input channels. With the
AMF01-A multiplexer board the number of channels can be extended to 64 single
ended or 32 differential channels. 

Triggering of conversions by the ADF01-B can be initiated by either the
internal programmable clock or by a user-supplied external clock. For each
conversion, the gain  and channel number are contained in one of 1024 entries
in the ADF01-B control table. The control table can thus be set up to perform
a large, fixed sequence of conversion operations. 

The Library contains calls such as:

^  ADF$INIT      initialize system
         
^  ADF$REASTA    read status of the device
         
^  ADF$RESET     reset device
         
To enable/disable functions:
          
^  ADF$SETSBE    enable sequence break
         
^  ADF$CLRSBE    disable sequence break
         
^  ADF$ENAECE    enable external clock
         
^  ADF$CLRECE    disable external clock
         
^  ADF$ENACTT    enable control table transfer
         
^  ADF$CLRCTT    disable control table transfer
         
To load or read Registers:
         
^  ADF$REACTA    read control table address register
         
^  ADF$LOACTA    write into control table addr. register
         
^  ADF$SETPCR    load programmable clock register
         
^  ADF$LOACWT    load control word register
         
^  ADF$REACWT    read control word register
         
^  ADF$SETDAC    load DAC data register

To start conversions and convert values:
         
^  ADF$CONVER    start A/D conversion

^  ADF$CONLAR    start A/D large buffer conversion
         
^  ADF$REAADC    convert A/D value into volt

To load sequence Timer Register (with AMF01-A):

^  ADF$SETSTR     enable sequence timer

^  ADF$DISSTR     disable sequence timer

In addition to the Subroutine calls above, the package  includes a set of
command files to generate a Control Word Table, to link Control Table and
User Program and to build the ADF01/VMS Subroutine Library. The package also
contains programs to calibrate the system and to run a DAC-ADC loop back
test. 

PERFORMANCE

The highest conversion rate depends highly on the VMS Operating System
configuration/load and on the way, how the incoming data are handled/saved.
The maximum transfer rate of 400K words/sec into memory can be achieved in
burst mode on all valid VAX systems with the standard DRX11-C/VMS Driver (SPD
26.64.xx). 

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

VAX, MicroVAX or VAXstation configuration as specified in the System Support
Addendum (SSA 26.61.02-x) 

^  One DRE11-C or DRQ11-C interface
^  One ADF01-B Interface
^  Hardware capable of reading one of the distribution media upon which this 
   product is offered.
