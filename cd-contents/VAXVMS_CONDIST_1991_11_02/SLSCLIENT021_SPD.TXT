           PRODUCT NAME:  VAX Storage Library System, Version 2.1 SPD
           29.67.04

           DESCRIPTION

           The VAX Storage Library System (SLS) is a VMS layered soft-
           ware product that provides users with the ability to man-
           age:

           o  File archiving operations

           o  VMS BACKUP operations

           o  Removable storage media

           o  Hardware devices used for archiving and backup operations

           VAX SLS software manages reel-to-reel magnetic tape, car-
           tridge tape, and optical cartridges. VAX SLS software sup-
           ports all VMS-supported reel-to-reel tape drives, all VMS-
           supported cartridge tape drives (including the TA90 and TF857
           media loaders), the RV20 write-once optical disk drive, and
           the RV64 optical jukebox.

           VAX SLS software maintains records of all files backed up
           or archived using its services for quick retrieval by users,
           operators, and storage administrators.

           The key capabilities of VAX SLS software are:

           o  Automatic scheduling of system backups

           o  Centralized services for user-requested backup and archiv-
              ing operations

           o  On-line maintenance of information about backed up and
              archived files, volumes, and physical media

           VAX Storage Library System, Version 2.1     SPD 29.67.04


           o  Support for unattended archiving and backup operations
              using the TA90 or TF857 automatic tape cartridge loader
              or the RV64 optical jukebox

           o  Media life cycle control based on customer-defined me-
              dia pools

           o  Vault (offsite media) management

           o  Built-in report generation and custom report generation
              capability

           o  Security features to prevent unauthorized media or de-
              vice use

           o  DCL and Menu interfaces for users, operators, and stor-
              age administrators (with on-line help)

           o  Customization features to meet a variety of operational
              and site requirements

           To support a variety of configuration requirements, two VAX
           SLS licenses are available:

           VAX SLS License

           VAX SLS software provides users at the node or VAXcluster
           at which it is executing with access to the full function-
           ality described above. VAX SLS software manages:

           o  the "VAX SLS media database," a VAX RMS file that describes
              all removable storage media known to VAX SLS software

           o  the "VAX SLS history files" in which information is recorded
              about user files backed up or archived under VAX SLS con-
              trol at the local node

           A node or VAXcluster executing VAX SLS software provides me-
           dia management services both for itself and for any "client
           nodes" connected to it. At least one VAX SLS license in the
           network is required for use of the VAX SLS product.

           VAX SLS REMOTE License

           VAX Storage Library System, Version 2.1     SPD 29.67.04


           VAX SLS REMOTE software provides backup scheduling and archiv-
           ing services for the node or VAXcluster on which it is ex-
           ecuting, and acts as a client of another node executing VAX
           SLS software when it requires media management services.

           A node or VAXcluster executing VAX SLS REMOTE software in
           communication with another node or VAXcluster executing VAX
           SLS software provides users with the full functionality de-
           scribed above.

           Like VAX SLS software, VAX SLS REMOTE software maintains "VAX
           SLS history files" in which it records information about user
           files backed up or archived locally under its control. The
           node executing VAX SLS REMOTE software communicates using
           DECnet software to a "server node" running VAX SLS software.
           The "server node" maintains the VAX SLS media database. The
           VAX SLS media database contains information about volume lo-
           cation and pool access authorization.

           Each VAX SLS REMOTE node must be connected to a server node
           executing VAX SLS software for media management services.
           Any number of VAX SLS REMOTE nodes may be connected to a sin-
           gle VAX SLS node.
