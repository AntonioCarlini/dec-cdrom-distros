           PRODUCT NAME: DEC PrintServer Supporting Host   SPD 27.68.06
                         Software for VMS, Version 4.0

           DESCRIPTION

           The DEC PrintServer Supporting Host Software for VMS is a
           VMS layered product that enables suitably configured VMS sys-
           tems within an Ethernet local area network to boot and pro-
           vide support functions for the PrintServer 20, Turbo PrintServer
           20, PrintServer 40, and PrintServer 40 Plus.

           Supporting Host software consists of the following compo-
           nents:

           o  A primary boot image which is downline loaded into the
              PrintServer upon receipt of a boot request. It contin-
              ues the boot process and becomes the "loader" for the re-
              maining components.

           o  A management component which includes support via DEC-
              net for PrintServer configuration files, downline load-
              ing of secondary boot files, and remote storage of event
              log and accounting files.

           o  A console component which allows management and monitor-
              ing of a printer from a terminal on the supporting host
              system or from the local console terminal for a PrintServer
              40 or PrintServer 40 Plus.

           o  A PrintServer component which is downline loaded into the
              PrintServer. It includes DECnet and INTERNET distribu-
              tion services, remote console services (also local con-
              sole client for the PrintServer 40 and PrintServer 40 Plus
              and local panel services for the PrintServer 20 and Turbo

              PrintServer 20), and the PostScript[R] interpreter. The in-
              terpreter processes PostScript commands and generates imag-
              ing data for the printer controller.

           If multiple PrintServers reside within the local area net-
           work, the same number of Supporting Hosts may be used to load
           and manage them. Alternatively, the load and management op-
           erations can be consolidated onto any number of suitably con-
           figured supporting hosts which would perform these opera-
           tions for all PrintServers on the local area network.

           In a VMS environment, DECprint Printing Services for VMS (SPD
           32.41.xx) is the companion product if you are running VAX
           VMS V5.3 or V5.4; otherwise, the companion product is VAX
           PrintServer Client Software (SPD 27.67.xx). In an ULTRIX en-
           vironment, the ULTRIX Operating System V4.0 began bundling
           the PrintServer Client functionality. For systems at some
           version of ULTRIX less than V4.0, the PrintServer Client Soft-
           ware for ULTRIX (SPD 30.86.01) is the companion product. Please
           refer to System Support Addendum (SSA 27.68.06-x) for spe-
           cific software prerequisites.

           The client software must reside on each system that either
           wants to print directly to the PrintServer or provide dis-
           tributed printing services for other systems printing in-
           directly or spooling. A system running the client software
           can transmit print requests to any suitably configured PrintServer
           on the network that is defined in its network database. The
           maximum number of print clients that can simultaneously be
           connected to a PrintServer 20, Turbo PrintServer 20, or PrintServer
           40 Plus is sixteen; on the PrintServer 40, the maximum is
           twelve.

           DEC PrintServer Supporting Host            SPD 27.68.06
           Software for VMS, Version 4.0

           Features

           PostScript

           The PostScript language's page description capabilities in-
           clude the following features, which may be used in any com-
           bination:

           o  Arbitrary shapes constructed from straight lines, arcs,
              and cubic curves; such shapes may self-intersect and con-
              tain disconnected sections and holes.

           o  Painting primitives that permit a shape to be outlined
              with lines of any thickness, filled with any gray shade,
              or used as a clipping path to crop any other graphics.

           o  Text fully integrated with graphics. Text characters are
              treated as graphical shapes that may be operated on by
              any PostScript graphics operator.

           o  Sampled images derived from natural sources or generated
              synthetically. The PostScript graphics model allows sam-
              pled images at any resolution and with a variety of dy-
              namic ranges, and it provides a number of facilities to
              control the rendering of images on the PrintServer.

           o  A general coordinate system facility that supports all
              combinations of linear transformations including trans-
              lation, scaling, rotation, reflection, and skewing. These
              transformations apply uniformly to all elements of a page
              description, including text, graphical shapes, and sam-
              pled images.

           o  A rendering algorithm, DECimage, which enhances the qual-
              ity of natural (halftone) images when printed on laser
              printers.

           PrintServer Console Clients

           DEC PrintServer Supporting Host            SPD 27.68.06
           Software for VMS, Version 4.0

           PrintServer console clients are available for all PrintServers
           through a command-line interface at terminals on the Sup-
           porting Host or at the local PrintServer consoles for the
           PrintServer 40 and PrintServer 40 Plus. The console services
           enables the system manager to monitor the status of the PrintServer.
           There are two types of console functions, privileged and un-
           privileged. To access the privileged functions, a password
           must be entered.

           Unprivileged console functions include:

           In addition, the PrintServer 20 and Turbo PrintServer 20 have
           a front panel with a 2x24 LED display which provides PrintServer
           information. The front panel status messages can be displayed
           in English, French, German, Dutch, Swedish, or Norwegian.

           Centralized Event Logging

           The types of events that are logged by the PrintServer range
           from successful completion of jobs to fatal errors. These
           events can optionally be displayed on remote console ter-
           minals and are always displayed on the local console of the
           PrintServer 40 and PrintServer 40 Plus; a small subset of
           similar event messages are displayed on the front panel of
           the PrintServer 20 and turbo PrintServer 20. Events can also
           be recorded in an event log file on the Supporting Host. A
           separate event log file is maintained for each PrintServer
           managed by the Supporting Host software. The PrintServer com-
           municates with the management client component running on
           the supporting host, which in turn, writes to the event log.

           Software for VMS, Version 4.0

           Each PrintServer can send the logging data to multiple sup-
           porting hosts that request this data.

           Centralized Accounting

           The PrintServer's accounting utility provides the system man-
           ager with a convenient way to monitor all access of a PrintServer
           and to bill for printer usage. As with event logging data,
           accounting information can be sent to multiple Supporting
           Host systems on the network.

           The accounting utility is provided to prepare each PrintServer's
           usage report on a per-user-basis. Information captured in-
           cludes username (including client system), total number of
           sheets/sides printed, accounting by tray, and PostScript CPU
           time used (in seconds). In addition, the system manager can
           specify cost (per sheet, per side, and/or per seconds of CPU
           time); the utility also allows for accounting to begin from
           a specific date.

           Controlled Access to a PrintServer

           The PrintServer's client access feature provides the sys-
           tem manager with a convenient way to control all access to
           a PrintServer. Printing restrictions to a PrintServer are
           specified by either "allowing" or "denying" access to a PrintServer.
           The allow command adds DECnet area numbers or node addresses
           and Internet addresses, networks, or subnet numbers to the
           list of nodes or areas that are allowed to communicate with
           the PrintServer system. The deny command adds DECnet area
           numbers or node addresses and Internet addresses, networks,
           or subnet numbers to the list of nodes or areas that are not
           allowed to communicate with the PrintServer system.Access
           restriction applies not only to print clients, but to man-
           agement and console clients as well.

           Downline Loading the PrintServer Image

           DEC PrintServer Supporting Host            SPD 27.68.06
           Software for VMS, Version 4.0

           The Supporting Host Software downline loads the PrintServer
           primary image upon receipt of a load request from a PrintServer.
           In the event multiple systems on the Ethernet are running
           the Supporting Host Software (and are enabled to service boot
           requests), the first system to respond to a PrintServer's
           load request will downline load the PrintServer primary im-
           age. The management client provides configuration and ad-
           ministrative services as well as secondary image loading.

           For users requiring DECnet or DECnet and INTERNET access,
           the MOP booting protocol is required from either the VMS or
           ULTRIX supporting host.

           PrintServer Component
           The PrintServer Component is the software that is downline
           loaded to and runs in the PrintServer.

           This software consists of the following parts:

           o  Distribution Software accepts print and control data from
              DECnet or INTERNET print client systems or a supporting
              host on the network and passes the data to the imaging
              software (PostScript interpreter). The distribution soft-
              ware also passes system messages from the imaging soft-
              ware to the apporpriate print client or management client
              and provides console client services.

           o  Imaging Software which interprets data from the distri-
              bution software, builds the corresponding bitmaps, and
              sends those bitmaps to the print engine to be converted
              to printed output.

           o  The Imaging Software also passes any system messages from
              the print engine or interpreter to the distribution Soft-
              ware which passes the information to the appropriate print,
              console, and/or management client running on a Support-
              ing Host system.

           patibility between ALL-IN-1, WPS-Plus, and Digital PostScript
           printers. ALL-IN-1/WPS-Plus users can access the many unique
           features of these printers; these include support for du-
           plex printing, number_up, landscape page orientation, print-
           ing of multiple paper sizes, and sheet_count. PrintServer
           performance is greatly improved for ALL-IN-1 multiple se-
           lection and print operations. Support for LN03 font cartridge
           emulation (via DECprint Printing Services for VMS or Third
           Party) is also included.
