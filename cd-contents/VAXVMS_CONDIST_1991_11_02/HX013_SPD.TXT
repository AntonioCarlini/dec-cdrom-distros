     PRODUCT NAME:  MicroVAX/DRQ3B Device Driver, Version 1.3A    SPD
     29.25.03

     DESCRIPTION

     The MicroVAX/DRQ3B Device Driver (HXDRIVER) supports the DRQ3B
     interface, which is a general purpose 16 bit parallel interface
     between the MicroVAX Q-bus and a user's peripheral. The DRQ3B,
     under driver control, is capable of performing double buffered
     direct memory access (DMA) using the block mode capabilities
     of the Q-bus to provide high bandwidth data transfers. The
     DRQ3B interface also has 512 word FIFO (First In, First Out)
     buffers on both the input and output ports to allow data to be
     transferred while an interrupt service routine is setting up the
     next buffer.

     Features

     o  Double buffering of I/O requests

     o  Buffer termination via an external event (EOP)

     o  External interrupt

     o  Function bit setting/clearing

     o  DMA operations directly to Q-bus memory

     o  Error handling

     Double Buffering of I/O Requests

     As long as two or more buffers are queued to the driver, it will
     automatically try to double buffer the I/O requests. A function
     modifier IO$M_HX_HOLD_DMA allows an application to queue up
     multiple buffers before starting I/O, so all the queued buffers
     can be double buffered.

     Buffer Termination Via an External Event (EOP)

     The hardware has a line on the input connector that is handled
     like a 17th data bit, but will cause a DMA operation to termi-
     nate and a new one to start when asserted and read out of the
     FIFO by the DMA controller. The driver supports this condition
     and returns the number of words transferred, including the last
     one transferred with the external event asserted as well as the
     success code SS$_WASSET, rather than the conventional SS$_NORMAL
     so an application can test for the occurrence of this condition.

     External Interrupt

     A line separate from the external event line allows an inter-
     rupt to be generated. The driver allows the detection of this
     condition in an AST routine.

     Function Bit Setting/Clearing

     The driver provides SETMODE functions that will set/clear the
     function bits for a given port, and allows the function bits to
     be read with a SENSEMODE function.

     DMA Operations Directly to Q-bus Memory

     The driver supports two forms of I/O, logical and physical.

     o  Physical I/O transfers allow the transfer of data directly to
        Q-bus memory and specialized I/O subsystems such as found in
        some types of array processors.

     o  The driver also allows MicroVAX memory to be used for physi-
        cal I/O transfers to reduce overhead.

     o  Logical I/O supports the more traditional mechanisms for
        performing DMA. As a result, it is easier to program but is a
        little less efficient.

     Error Handling

     The driver will report nonexistent memory conditions (NXMs),
     FIFO overruns and FIFO underruns in case the interface logic
     stops handshaking correctly.

     The DRQ3B MicroVAX Device Driver can support up to four DRQ3B
     Interfaces.
