     PRODUCT NAME:  VAX ISDN ACCESS, Version 1.1         SPD 31.24.01

     DESCRIPTION

     VAX ISDN ACCESS allows suitably configured DECnet-VAX nodes
     in a DECnet network to control connections to an ISDN network
     remotely at a DECnet node that is physically connected to the
     ISDN network running the VAX ISDN software. This type of node is
     called an ISDN connector node.

     The ISDN connector node is a DECnet-VAX node that is physically
     connected to a supported ISDN network via a Basic Rate Access
     (DEC ISDNcontroller 100/DIV32) and is running both VAX ISDN
     software and DECnet-VAX software.

     This node must be licensed for and running the VAX ISDN soft-
     ware. Refer to Software Product Description (SPD 31.23.xx)
     as well as DECnet-VAX, either end-node or full-function (SPD
     25.03.xx).
