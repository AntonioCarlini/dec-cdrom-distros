     PRODUCT NAME:  NMCC/DECnet Monitor, Version 2.3     SPD 26.91.05

     DESCRIPTION

     NMCC/DECnet Monitor is a network monitoring system for Phase
     IV/IV+ DECnet network nodes. It runs as a layered application
     on VMS Systems and does not require any additional hardware or
     software on the remote DECnet nodes to be monitored. NMCC/DECnet
     Monitor collects and monitors data concerning the DECnet net-
     work. NMCC/DECnet Monitor enables the user to store, distribute,
     analyze, and evaluate the data into useful and comprehensible
     information, and to present the data either as a screen display
     or as a printed report.

     NMCC/DECnet Monitor consists of software modules which combine
     to form a comprehensive monitoring system. The central component
     of NMCC/DECnet Monitor is the Kernel, a data acquisition pro-
     cess, which collects data from the network using polling and/or
     event logging. Polling can be used to obtain status, character-
     istics and traffic/error counters. Event logging can be set up
     to cause remote nodes to log events automatically to the Ker-
     nel, including status changes and traffic/error counters as they
     occur.

     The network manager has full control over which nodes are
     polled, the polling rates, and which remote nodes log events.
     The Kernel processes the raw data and creates a log file of sta-
     tistical data which is then available to the NMCC/DECnet Reports
     subsystem for the production of network reports.

     The User Interface subsystem provides an easy-to-use command in-
     terface to the NMCC/DECnet Monitor. It provides on-line graphic
     and lexical video displays of selected error statistics, traffic
     statistics, and status information. The displays are designed
     hierarchically so that the user can select the network compo-
     nents, information types, and levels of detail in a consistent
     and easy to use manner. The graphic displays include histograms,
     linear scales, and a network map.

     The User Interface subsystem also provides the user with the
     capability to build and manipulate various databases maintained
     by NMCC/DECnet Monitor, including a network component reference
     database. This contains a description of all nodes and physical
     links in the network. It includes such details as CPU type, type
     and version of operating system, name and telephone number of
     system manager, name and telephone number of customer service
     contacts, and many other useful details. Display commands are
     provided to retrieve this information. The user interface to
     these commands is consistent with the operational interface of
     the product.

     The NMCC/DECnet Reports subsystem provides the following reports
     via access to the log files:

     o  Error Reports

        -  Network Summary

        -  System

        -  Line

     o  Traffic Reports

        -  Network Summary

     o  Configuration Report
        The NMCC/DECnet Monitor History Files and Summary Files are
        explained in the NMCC/DECnet Monitor User Documentation.
        These files provide information regarding the operation
        and performance of the network and can be accessed by user-
        written application programs.
