           PRODUCT NAME:  DECndu (Network Device Upgrade) Utility SPD
           33.47.01                for VMS, Version 1.1

           DESCRIPTION

           DECndu (Network Device Upgrade) Utility allows users, at a
           host in an "Extended LAN," to upgrade the existing version
           of software within the DECbridge 500, DECconcentrator 500,
           and the DEC FDDIcontroller 400.

           DECbridge 500, DECconcentrator 500 and DEC FDDIcontroller
           are FDDI products which ship from the factory with the soft-
           ware preloaded. The software resides in electrically alter-
           able memory within the hardware and is updated via the DEC-
           ndu Utility.

           DECndu upgrades the existing version of software in the DEC
           FDDIcontroller 400 via the local backplane.

           DECndu upgrades the existing version of software in the DECbridge
           500, and DECconcentrator 500 via the "Extended LAN." An "Ex-
           tended LAN" is a collection of LANs (Local Area Networks)
           that are interconnected and logically appear as one large
           Local Area Network.

           General characteristics of the DECndu Utility for VMS:

           o  Installs and resides on the host in the LAN

           o  Loads the new device software from the host into elec-
              trically alterable memory within the hardware device, where
              it will remain

           o  Verifies that the load was successful
