          PRODUCT NAME:  DECnet/SNA VMS Gateway Management,  SPD 29.70.01
                         Version 2.1

          DESCRIPTION

          DECnet/SNA VMS Gateway Management provides configuration and
          management functions for use with DECnet/SNA Gateway for Syn-
          chronous Transport V1.1 (DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST SPD 25.C6.xx)
          and DECnet/SNA Gateway for Channel Transport V2.0 (DECnet/SNA
          Gateway-CT SPD 29.76.xx) products. Both DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST
          and DECnet/SNA Gate-way-CT are products designed to allow users
          to bidirectionally exchange information and share resources
          between suitably configured Digital systems in a DECnet environ-
          ment and IBM[R] systems in a Systems Network Architecture (SNA)
          environment. Please refer to the appropriate DECnet/SNA Gateway
          Software Product Description (SPD) for more information on those
          products.

          DECnet/SNA VMS Gateway Management allows the Gateway adminis-
          trator to configure the software executing in the DECnet/SNA
          Gateway-ST or DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT system. This product al-
          lows the administrator to set up parameters relating to lines,
          circuits, physical units, logical units, and other key vari-
          ables necessary for network to network communications between
          the DECnet and SNA networks. Additionally, DECnet/SNA VMS Gate-
          way Management allows the administrator to manage and diagnose
          problems related to the DECnet/SNA Gateway.

          DECnet/SNA VMS Gateway Management software is required on
          the Digital load host node for DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT and/or
          DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST. It must also be present on any other
          VMS node where users want to manage a DEC MicroServer/DEC
          MicroServer-SP (DECnet/SNA Gateway-ST) or DEC ChannelServer/DEC

          DECnet/SNA VMS Gateway Management, Version 2.1      SPD 29.70.01



          ChannelServer II (DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT) based Gateway. It is
          strongly recommended that the software also be installed on VMS
          systems where IBM Interconnect application programs are devel-
          oped using any of the DECnet/SNA Programming Interface products
          in order to facilitate debugging functions.

          DECnet/SNA VMS Gateway Management can be used to configure and
          monitor DEC MicroServer, DEC MicroServer-SP, DEC ChannelServer,
          and DEC ChannelServer II based Gateway products. It does not
          support DECnet/SNA Gateway V1.x (DECSA-FA/DX24) Gateways which
          are managed by using the DECnet/SNA VMS Gateway Management for
          DECSA V1.X product.

          Gateway management includes DECnet style network management
          tools for configuring, controlling, monitoring, and trou-
          bleshooting the DECnet/SNA Gateway itself. These activities
          may be performed by the Digital system manager of a designated
          host node on the Ethernet Local Area Network for the DECnet/SNA
          Gateway. All management functions are performed from a node on
          the Digital network rather than at or on the Gateway itself.

          Management of the DECnet/SNA Gateway should be viewed as part
          of the Digital environment, while the management of the lines
          and/or channel connecting the DECnet/SNA Gateway to the IBM
          system is a joint responsibility of the IBM and Digital systems
          managers. (Refer to the Customer Responsibilities section of
          this Software Product Description.)

          Controlling and Monitoring the Gateway

          DECnet/SNA VMS Gateway Management allows a Digital system op-
          erator to remotely bootstrap or restart a DECnet/SNA Gateway
          and provide configuration and initialization facilities for the
          DECnet/SNA Gateway.

          Problem Isolation and Determination Tools for the Gateway

          In addition to event logging and error counters, a wide range of
          fault isolation tools are included.

          DECnet/SNA VMS Gateway Management, Version 2.1      SPD 29.70.01



          Two trace capabilities (NETTRACE and SNATRACE) for use with the
          DECnet/SNA Gateway(s) are provided to help debug application
          programs as well as assist in identifying system problems. An
          operator can run a trace at the Line/Circuit, Physical Unit
          (PU) or Session level, and then format the data on a specified
          Digital system. The trace features are helpful in identifying an
          error for remedial action.

          A snapshot monitoring utility is provided to display on a Digi-
          tal host-controlled terminal the status of the Gateway's buffer
          availability, the number of SNA sessions currently in progress,
          and other information that pertains to both the DECnet and SNA
          network.

          If an irrecoverable error should occur during operation of the
          DECnet/SNA Gateway system, a memory image may be dumped to a
          designated Ethernet attached VAX host.

          Features

          The differences between DECnet/SNA VMS Gateway Management V2.1
          and DECnet/SNA VMS Gateway Management V2.0 are:

          o  NETTRACE - A command-driven utility which allows tracing to
             run as a background process

          o  The ability to assign Access Names across multiple Physical
             Units

          o  Support for the License Management Facility (LMF)

          o  The ability to log event messages to an ASCII file
