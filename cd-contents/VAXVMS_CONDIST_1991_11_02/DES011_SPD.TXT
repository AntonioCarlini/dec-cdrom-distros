     PRODUCT NAME:  DECdesign, Version 1.1               SPD 29.29.01

     DESCRIPTION

     DECdesign is a DECwindows-based, VMS layered product that graph-
     ically supports the analysis and design phase of the software
     development life cycle. Graphics-based analysis and design
     models describe the application under development the way
     blueprints describe a building under construction.

     Software engineers using DECdesign can create, modify or reuse
     these models to describe a software system according to the
     rules of the modeling technique.

     DECdesign supported modeling techniques are Yourdon process
     modeling with Ward-Mellor real-time extensions and Extended
     Entity Relationship (EER) data modeling, Gane & Sarson process
     modeling and Extended Entity Relationship (EER) data modeling,
     and MERISE process and data modeling. MERISE, now available,
     is a technique that was developed by the French "Ministere de
     l'Industrie" in the 1970s.

     On-line training, which is included with the product, provides
     the user of DECdesign the opportunity to learn how to use the
     product at their own pace and in the convenience of their of-
     fice. This training has been designed in a modular format to
     allow the user to train on selected specific functionality in
     the context of their chosen technique. At this time, the tech-
     niques supported with this level of training are Yourdon/EER
     and Gane & Sarson/EER. There is no on-line training provided
     for MERISE. In addition, context sensitive help is included in
     DECdesign, providing ready access to on-line information about
     specific functionality.

     Features

     DECdesign is a multiple-user system that supports concurrent
     access, data security, and permanent data storage.

     DECdesign stores analysis and design models in libraries. A
     library has the following functions:

     o  Security - users can be authorized to use a library.

     o  Data storage - the library maintains incremental versions of
        views.

     o  Data sharing - all authorized users of a library have access
        to all views in the library.

     o  Design control - the library applies the rules for the user's
        modeling technique; these include:

        -  The shape and meaning of graphical objects in a model

        -  Requirements for a valid model

        -  Tools for evaluating and reporting on the state of the
           models

     The software designer can select from one of three technique
     libraries available in DECdesign to model their application;
     Yourdon (with Ward-Mellor extensions)/EER, Gane & Sarson/EER, or
     MERISE. The models are defined and manipulated using graphic
     icons that represent the constructs of a chosen technique.
     DECdesign, upon the user's request, will check for valid models
     based upon predefined but differing rules for each technique.
     DECdesign does not support validation of Ward-Mellor State
     Transition Diagrams or State Tables.

     The process and data models are integrated in each of the three
     libraries through the sharing of data definitions.

     DECdesign is integrated with CDD/Plus. Selected data defini-
     tions stored in CDD/Plus can be reused by importing and linking
     to models produced in DECdesign. Likewise, selected data def-
     initions created in DECdesign can be exported and linked to
     CDD/Plus. Notification of changes to these linked definitions in
     CDD/Plus is provided to the DECdesign user.

     DECdesign allows the user to navigate interactively through the
     model database determining where elements of that database are
     used.

     Information about the model database is also provided to the
     user with the aid of an extensive set of report templates.
     These reports can be previewed on the display or output to a
     VMS file using the Digital Data Interchange Format (DDIF), which
     is a part of Digital Equipment Corporation's Compound Document
     Architecture (CDA).

     DECdesign has been implemented to support a client/server model
     of operation. The product can run on a stand-alone worksta-
     tion with both client and server images of DECdesign running
     on the workstation. Alternatively, the client and server im-
     ages of DECdesign can be divided physically to run on separate
     systems. Client and server image installation can be selected
     at installation time. For further information and installation
     procedures, refer to the DECdesign Installation Guide.

     HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

     VAX, MicroVAX, VAXstation, or VAXserver configuration as speci-
     fied in the System Support Addendum (SSA 29.29.01-x).

     SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

     For Workstations Running DECwindows:

     o  VMS Operating System (and necessary components of VMS DECwin-
        dows)

     o  VAX CDD/Plus

     Note: VAX CDD/Plus is required for the server component of the
     DECdesign client/server model.

     Refer to the System Support Addendum (SSA 29.29.01-x) for avail-
     ability and required versions of prerequisite/optional software
     and for information regarding components of VMS DECwindows.

     ORDERING INFORMATION

     Note: DECdesign is now offered in modules. Each module requires
     a PAK that must be installed. Each order must include licenses
     for the DECdesign platform and from 1-3 of the distinct tech-
     niques offered. The previous offering of DECdesign consisted of
     the DECdesign platform, one Yourdon technique, and one Gane &
     Sarson Technique in a single license and documentation set.

     The software media kit contains consolidated binaries for the
     platform and all of the techniques. However, this kit now con-
     tains only platform documentation. The individual licenses and
     documentation kit(s) for the technique(s) ordered must be pur-
     chased separately.
