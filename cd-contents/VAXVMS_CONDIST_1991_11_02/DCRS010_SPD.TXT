           34.24.00                for VMS, Version 1.0

           DESCRIPTION

           DECimage Character Recognition Services for VMS is a set of
           runtime services for the recognition and conversion of text
           information contained in bitonal images. Images can be scanned
           documents or existing bitonal image files. It provides a language-
           independent programmable interface that is used in conjunc-
           tion with DECimage Application Services to develop image ap-
           plications that include character recognition. DECimage Char-
           acter Recognition Services also provides the runtime envi-
           ronment for these applications.

           DECimage Character Recognition Services supports a subset
           of the ISO LATIN-1 character set. It recognizes most com-
           mon European languages and a broad range of fonts in a broad
           range of font sizes. It converts recognized text into ASCII,
           DDIF, or PostScript® format. Converted text can be used by
           text-based editors, forms packages, indexing systems, and
           electronic mail.

           DECimage Character Recognition Services can process an en-
           tire image for character recognition or specified regions
           of interest.

           DECimage Character Recognition Services provides the fol-
           lowing classes of services:

           DECimage Character Recognition Services     SPD 34.24.00
           for VMS, Version 1.0

           Separates regions of the image containing text from regions
           that do not contain text. Non-text regions may consist of
           white or black space or graphics. Only areas determined to
           be text regions are further processed by Text Recognition
           Services.

           Text Recognition Services

           These services examine text regions to determine character
           information within the region. These services also derive
           font style and font size information for the region.

           Page Formatting Services

           Groups the individual recognized characters into words, para-
           graphs, and columns on a page.

           Text Export Services

           Converts the text information into ASCII, DDIF, or PostScript
           format for use by other applications.

           Structure Access Services

           Allows applications to extract information such as region
           boundaries or individual words from a page structure. Also
           allows deleting regions of the page that are not of inter-
           est.

           Postprocessing Services

           Performs housekeeping functions such as deleting buffers or
           structures created during the recognition process.

           HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

           VAX, MicroVAX, VAXstation, or VAXserver configurations as
           specified in the System Support Addendum (SSA 34.24.00-x).
