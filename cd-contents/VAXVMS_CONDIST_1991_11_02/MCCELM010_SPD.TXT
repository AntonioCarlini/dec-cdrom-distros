           PRODUCT NAME: DECmcc Extended LAN Manager AM, SPD 31.33.01
                         Version 1.0

           DESCRIPTION

           DECmcc Extended LAN Manger AM is a VMS layered product that
           allows users, at a VAX host, to configure, manage, monitor,
           control, and observe any LAN Bridge, DECbridge 5xx, 6xx, and
           DECconcentrator 500 physical media variants in the "Extended
           LAN" and FDDI network environment. The term LAN Bridge is
           used to refer to Digital Equipment Corporation's LAN Bridge
           100, LAN Bridge 150, LAN Bridge 200, METROWAVE Bridge, and
           Chipcom[R]'S Ethermodem[TM] Broadband Bridge.

           The LAN Bridge and DECbridge products are the primary build-
           ing blocks of the "Extended LAN" (Local Area Network) ar-
           chitecture. An Extended LAN is a collection of LANs that are
           interconnected and logically appear as one large Local Area
           Network. The DECconcentrator family of products is the pri-
           mary building block of the FDDI network environment. Together
           these environments are physically and logically attached and
           extended via the DECbridge family of products. The DECbridge
           product line is the family of products which allow Ether-
           net and FDDI networks to communicate transparently.

           The LAN Bridge and DECbridge products operate at the data
           link level, and FDDI DECconcentrators operate at the phys-
           ical link level. Both product sets are transparent to up-
           per level protocols.

           DECmcc Extended LAN Manager AM resides on a VAX host. Cor-
           responding management firmware resides in the LAN Bridges,
           DECbridges, and FDDI DECconcentrators.

           DECmcc Extended LAN Manager AM,             SPD 31.33.01
           Version 1.0

           The management protocol is used to communicate between the
           DECmcc VAX host running the DECmcc Extended LAN Manager AM
           software and the target LAN Bridges, DECbridges, and FDDI
           DECconcentrators. DECmcc Extended LAN Manager AM provides
           additional functionality to support the actual control and
           observation of the target LAN Bridges, DECbridges, and FDDI
           DECconcentrators.

           DECmcc Extended LAN Manager AM software is installed and runs
           on any one of four DECmcc configurations (DECmcc Director
           V1.1, DECmcc BMS (Basic Management System) V1.1, DECmcc SMS
           (Site Management Station) V2.1, DECmcc EMS (Enterprise Man-
           agement Station) V2.1.

           Depending on the user's DECmcc configuration, an additional
           software license may be required. Refer to the Optional Soft-
           ware Section of the DECmcc Extended LAN Manager AM System
           Support Addendum (SSA 31.33.00-x) for more detail.

           DECmcc Extended LAN Manager AM V1.0 is the release of soft-
           ware which begins the migration of the DECelms point prod-
           uct functionality to the DECmcc environment.

           The general characteristics of DECmcc Extended LAN Manager
           AM include:

           o  Basic DECelms functionality under DECmcc

           o  Remote management capabilities for FDDI and Ethernet de-
              vices

           o  Allows for observation, monitoring, and controlling of
              inter-operable FDDI and Ethernet networks

           o  Ability to display and modify devices, lines, physical
              ports, forwarding database and protocol database char-
              acteristics

           o  Ability to enable and disable lines and physical ports
