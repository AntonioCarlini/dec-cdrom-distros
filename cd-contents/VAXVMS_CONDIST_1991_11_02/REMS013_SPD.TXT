     PRODUCT NAME:  VAX Remote Environmental Monitoring  SPD 29.73.03
                    Software (REMS), Version 1.3

     DESCRIPTION

     VAX REMS supports Digital Equipment Corporation's HA3000,
     HA1000, and 4N-AExxx Personal Series Uninterruptible Power Sys-
     tems, H7317 Power Distribution System PLUS (PDS+) and H7318
     Power Conditioning System Plus (PCS+) microprocessor-based envi-
     ronmental and power distribution systems, and the H7310 Environ-
     mental Monitoring System. With the PDS+/PCS+ and/or EMS systems,
     complemented by the VAX REMS software, complete environmental
     surveillance of a computer site and supporting equipment is ac-
     complished. In addition, VAX REMS Version 1.3 communicates with
     the various UPS systems to accept alarm and status information
     from those products' internal sensors.

     Through the use of sensors that are both internal and exter-
     nal to the PDS+/PCS+ units, and external sensors in the EMS
     units, environmental changes are detected, and depending on
     user-defined threshold settings for these sensors, notification
     alarms are triggered on the host VAX system. Optionally, utiliz-
     ing embedded sensors within the various UPS systems, internal
     parameters and alarms are retrieved in a time-stamped sequence
     allowing this information to be included within the VMS file
     structure created by REMS. VAX REMS provides continuous unat-
     tended monitoring and collection of environmental data and will
     only require attention if an alarm condition is reached on one
     of its sensors.

     VAX Remote Environmental Monitoring                 SPD 29.73.03
     Software (REMS), Version 1.3


     Employing an easy to learn and use menu and forms-style user
     interface, VAX REMS facilitates the task of configuring the
     environmental sensors for a complete system. For status inquiry
     and alarm notification purposes, VAX REMS generally eliminates
     the need to use the H7310 local terminal interface, along with
     the PCS+/PDS+ and UPS consoles.


     Features

     VAX REMS can be used in menu or command mode. Menus or commands
     enable the user to do the following:

     o  Add, delete, or configure external sensors on the H731x
        hardware.

     o  Display probe data and status.

     o  Monitor the inputs from a probe or a group of probes.

     o  Display alarm conditions.

     o  Display PDS+/PCS+ communication status.

     o  Invoke a user process when a threshold condition occurs.

     o  Generate historical reports of environmental history.

     HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

     VAX, MicroVAX, VAXstation, or VAXserver configuration as speci-
     fied in the System Support Addendum (SSA 29.73.00-x).

     At least one RS232 terminal port, either hard wired or connected
     over LAT through a terminal server.
