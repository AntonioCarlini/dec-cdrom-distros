                    (Formerly VMS Services for PCs)

     DESCRIPTION

     PATHWORKS for VMS is based on the Personal Computing Systems
     Architecture (PCSA), which is an extension of Digital Equipment
     Corporation's systems and networking architecture that merges
     the VAX, RISC and personal computer environments. The PATHWORKS
     product family, developed under the PCSA architecture, provides
     a framework for integrating personal computers into an organiza-
     tion's total information system so that different types of users
     can share information and network services across the entire
     organization.

     The PATHWORKS family of software products includes:

     o  PATHWORKS for VMS - Software that allows a VMS-based VAX
        system to act as a file, print, mail and disk server to DOS
        and OS/2[R] personal computers. (Described in this document.)

     o  PATHWORKS for ULTRIX - Software that allows an ULTRIX-based
        VAX or ULTRIX-Based RISC system to act as a file, print and
        mail server to DOS and OS/2personal computers. (Described in
        SPD 32.44.xx.)

     o  PATHWORKS for OS/2 - Includes client software which allows
        a personal computer running the OS/2 Operating System to
        use the facilities provided by PATHWORKS for VMS, PATHWORKS
        for ULTRIX, or the PATHWORKS for OS/2 server software. Also
        includes server software which allows an OS/2 based personal
        computer to act as a file, print and mail server to other
        personal computers. (Described in SPD 55.24.xx.)

        puter running the DOS Operating System to use the facilities
        provided by PATHWORKS for VMS, PATHWORKS for ULTRIX, or
        the PATHWORKS for OS/2 server software. (Described in SPD
        55.07.xx.)

     o  PATHWORKS for DOS (TCP/IP) - Software required for a personal
        computer running the DOS Operating System to access services
        of a PATHWORKS for VMS or PATHWORKS for ULTRIX server via the
        TCP/IP network transport. (Described in SPD 33.45.xx.)

     o  DECnet/PCSA Client: VAXmate - Required software for VAX-
        mates to use the facilities provided by PATHWORKS for VMS.
        (Described in SPD 55.10.xx.)

     PATHWORKS for VMS software allows VAX, MicroVAX, VAXstation and
     VAXserver computers to act as application, data and resource
     servers to groups of personal computers. By using these server
     systems, personal computers can share applications, data and
     resources. Information can be accessed from local and remote
     systems and that information can be applied in DOS or OS/2
     applications.

     PATHWORKS for VMS supports DECnet, LAST and TCP/IP network
     transports in Local Area Network (LAN) environments and DECnet
     and TCP/IP in Wide Area Network (WAN) environments.

     Note: For the purposes of this Software Product Description,
     the term "DOS" refers to all disk operating system software
     supported by PATHWORKS for DOS software. (See System Support Ad-
     dendum SSA 55.07.09-x.) The term "OS/2" refers to all operating
     system software supported by PATHWORKS for OS/2 software. (See
     SPD 55.24.xx.)

     Network Transport Support

     PATHWORKS for VMS supports DECnet, LAST and TCP/IP network
     transport software.

     DECnet

     The DECnet transport is provided with the VMS Operating System.
     Using DECnet, supported personal computer clients can access
     servers in both local area and wide area networks. Refer to
     the PATHWORKS for DOS and PATHWORKS for OS/2 Software Product
     Descriptions for detailed information on supported features.
     Using DECnet as a transport, PATHWORKS for VMS provides file,
     print, mail and time and date services to supported clients.

     TCP/IP

     PATHWORKS for VMS, Version 4.0                      SPD 30.50.07
     (Formerly VMS Services for PCs)


     Support for TCP/IP is available using the VMS/ULTRIX Connection
     product. PATHWORKS clients accessing PATHWORKS for VMS via
     TCP/IP can use file and print services only. Refer to PATHWORKS
     for DOS (TCP/IP) SPD 33.45.xx for details.

     LAST

     LAST is a high performance Local Area Network protocol sup-
     ported by PATHWORKS for VMS, that provides file, print and disk
     services. LAST does not support Wide Area Network functionality.

     Refer to the SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS section of this document for
     information on required network transport software.

     NetBIOS Interface Support

     PATHWORKS for VMS makes use of NetBIOS naming services and
     datagram service, however, a NetBIOS programmatic interface
     is not provided.

     PATHWORKS for VMS supports the NetBIOS interface in TCP/IP Net-
     works. The is a B-node RFC 1001/1002 compliant implementation.
     This means that the NetBIOS interface is supported under TCP/IP
     in Local Area Network (LAN) environments only.

     File Services

     PATHWORKS for VMS file services provides DOS and OS/2 clients
     with a remote file system that appears as a transparent exten-
     sion of the client system's local computing environment.

     PATHWORKS for VMS file services are based on the Microsoft[R]
     LAN Manager SMB (Server Message Block) protocols.

     Each DOS or OS/2 file stored through the file service is stored
     as a VMS file: either a Stream file or an RMS Sequential Fixed
     Length Record (512 record bytes) file type. The files stored
     through the file service are accessible to PC clients, VMS
     users, and to applications that can interpret the content and
     organization of the file written by the client application.
     Each read issued by the client application will result in the

                                     4

     presentation to the application of the next "n" data bytes
     contained sequentially in the file.

     Multiple DOS and OS/2 clients can concurrently access files
     stored on the server's disk through the file access modes and
     byte range locking support provided by the server as defined by
     Microsoft's SMB protocol.

     Through the use of the VMS Lock Manager, VMS and PC based appli-
     cations can control file access. Refer to Server Management and
     Control section of this SPD for further information on access
     control.

     Restrictions

     The DOS and OS/2 utilities that are specific to PC hardware
     devices cannot be used with file services, such as CHKDSK,
     FDISK, DISKCOPY, DISKCOMP and FORMAT.

     DOS filenames containing two underscores sequentially (__)
     are not supported by PATHWORKS for VMS. This is a restricted
     character sequence for use by the Server only.

     Disk Services

     Through Digital's Local Area Systems Transport (LAST), PATH-
     WORKS for VMS software provides PC clients with local area disk
     services. The local area disk service defines a space on a VMS
     disk for clients to access as a virtual disk. This virtual disk
     is formatted as an OS/2 or DOS disk. Because LAST is a LAN-only
     communications protocol, overhead is low and performance high.

     Local area disk services are accessible through the PATHWORKS
     for DOS client and PATHWORKS for OS/2 client software using
     LAST in a Local Area Network (LAN) and through the Network
     Disk Utility (NDU) using DECnet in a Wide Area Network (WAN).
     PATHWORKS for DOS and PATHWORKS for OS/2 client software can
     also access virtual disks created with NDU. Access to local area
     disks in extended LANs across bridges with a transfer speed of
     10Mb/seconds or less is also provided.

                                     5

     (Formerly VMS Services for PCs)


     Disk management may be done from the VAX or remotely from the
     personal computer.

     The local area disk service has the following restrictions:

     o  Only one client at a time may have read and write access to
        the local area disk.

     o  Multiple readers (and no writers) to a local area disk are
        allowed.

     o  The DOS and OS/2 files cannot be shared with VMS users.

     o  The local area disk service is available only in a Local
        Area Network configuration. However, virtual disks created
        with the local area disk service are available in a Wide Area
        Network through the Network Device Utility (NDU).

     The local area disk's size is established at its creation and
     can be 360K bytes, 720K bytes, 1.2M bytes, 1.44M bytes, 5M
     bytes, 10M bytes, 20M bytes, or 32M bytes, 64M bytes, 128M
     bytes, 256M bytes, 512M bytes. Refer to Server Management and
     Control for further information on access control.

     Print Services

     PATHWORKS for VMS software allows DOS, OS/2, and VMS users
     to share printers connected to a VAXserver, VAXcluster or LAT
     supported terminal servers in a LAN or WAN. PATHWORKS clients
     can send files to the remote printer from DOS, OS/2, Microsoft
     Windows (DOS clients only) or from applications. PC clients
     can also delete a remote print entry and can associate some VMS
     printing parameters with a redirected logical print device.

     The system administrator assigns a service name to a VMS print
     queue and can define user access to the print service. The
     PATHWORKS for DOS client and PATHWORKS for OS/2 client software
     redirect printer I/O from a client printer port to a defined
     print service.

     (Formerly VMS Services for PCs)


     The system administrator's utility in PATHWORKS for VMS software
     creates the physical and generic queues as well as defines forms
     for selected Digital and third party printers. Refer to Optional
     Hardware in the SSA for details.

     Multiple print services may be set up for the same printer.
     For example, a landscape service and a portrait service may
     be created for the same LN03 PLUS printer. In addition, other
     printer queues can be manually set to support additional Digital
     and third-party printers that are not listed in the menus.

     Mail Services

     The mail server which is part of PATHWORKS for VMS provides DOS
     and OS/2 clients with the ability to send and receive electronic
     mail messages. A mail account is established on the VMS server
     for each PC client. Mail can be sent to this account by other PC
     clients as well as users of VMS mail software. The mail server
     then routes messages to the appropriate client when the client
     logs onto the server.

     The PATHWORKS for VMS mail server provides the PC user with
     folders, distribution lists, and delivery capabilities. Notifi-
     cation of new messages occurs both real-time and upon login to a
     network session. Real-time notification of incoming messages can
     be optionally disabled by the client.

     PATHWORKS for VMS allows PC users to read mail without having to
     log in to the VMS system. The mail utility is based on the mail
     11 product.

     Time and Date Services

     DOS and OS/2 clients can request date and time information from
     the server system to set the local workstation date and time.

     Server Management and Control

     Two types of server management interface are provided by PATH-
     WORKS for VMS, a menu driven user interface, and a command line
     interface.

     (Formerly VMS Services for PCs)


     The Manager Menu is a PC style menu interface that requires only
     minimal knowledge of VMS Operating System commands. The Manager
     Menu allows the system administrator to manage file and print
     services, user accounts and the client workstation database.
     Users can also create groups of users and grant these groups
     access to file, disk and print services.

     Service and file access is supported across a VAXcluster. In
     a VAXcluster, a common database must be used for the cluster.
     Access to the file service is determined via standard VMS file
     access authorization mechanisms.

     Print service access is controlled through username, password,
     and VMS Access Control Lists.

     Access to the disk service is controlled via passwords, and the
     assignment of read-only or read/write privileges to users of a
     local area disk service.

     PATHWORKS for VMS also includes a DOS file maintenance utility
     called PCDISK which can be used to maintain DOS devices access-
     able to VMS. This would include virtual disk files, LAD disk
     services, and physical diskette devices on the VMS server. The
     interface is DOS-like, while VMS-style prompting, line edit-
     ing, and HELP are available. It supports wildcard file transfer
     between DOS devices and the VMS file system.

     The system administrator can restrict the number of simultane-
     ous client connections to a given service on the server. This
     capability means the system administrator can restrict access
     to DOS or OS/2 applications stored in the directory, to ensure
     compliance with vendor licensing agreements. Other restrictions
     on the use of the server can be imposed to help meet performance
     and security goals.

     An administrator's utility is provided to allow the system ad-
     ministrator to add and remove services, register clients, and
     list resources. The server software can list current connec-
     tions, current file opens, current sessions, and current ser-
     vices available, as well as show various counters. The server

     (Formerly VMS Services for PCs)


     also provides for the use of broadcast information to all ac-
     tively connected clients that are configured to use RECEIVE.

     PATHWORKS for VMS also includes an automated tool called the
     Configurator which is used to tune the VMS server. The Configu-
     rator will verify and recommend the appropriate changes needed,
     if any, to the VMS sysgen parameters so that the PATHWORKS soft-
     ware will make optimal use of the VMS server.

     In addition, the Manager Menu can be used to view the following
     log files:

     o  Audit log file which tracks network and server events, such
        as notices about connections being opened and closed, and
        failed attempts to access server resources.

     o  Error log file is used to log server related errors.

     The server administrator can also use the command line interface
     to control all the features and services that are accessible via
     Menus. The command line interface can also be invoked by batch
     allowing the user to create automated command procedures.

     Broadcast Utility

     PATHWORKS for VMS includes a message broadcast facility that
     allows the system administrator to send messages to workstations
     in the local area network. A message can be sent to a single
     client or to all currently active clients in the LAN.

     The broadcast utility can be used to inform users of system
     events, such as the creation of new services or the shutdown of
     the system.

     Remote Boot Services (DOS clients only)

     PATHWORKS for VMS software also enables remote boot for VAXmates
     and DOS personal computers with Digital's DEPCA or DEMCA PC Eth-
     ernet controllers. DOS personal computers using other supported
     Ethernet controllers can remote boot utilizing the supplied
