     PRODUCT NAME:  DECmcc TCP/IP SNMP Access Module for VMS,     SPD
     32.50.00
                    Version 1.0

     DESCRIPTION

     The DECmcc TCP/IP SNMP AM is a component of the EMA-compliant
     DECmcc family of products. It provides DECmcc with access to
     systems in a TCP/IP network that have a Simple Network Man-
     agement Protocol (SNMP) agent. Using SNMP protocol, the DECmcc
     TCP/IP SNMP AM V1.0 provides DECmcc with data to perform con-
     figuration management on these devices, and monitor and control
     them via the DECmcc Forms and Command Line (FCL) user interface.

     The DECmcc TCP/IP SNMP AM along with the DECmcc Basic Management
     System becomes a Manager with the following SNMP capabilities:

     o  Fully conforms to the Internet Advisory Board RFC 1098
        (SNMP), and supports the SNMP Get, GetNext and Set opera-
        tions.

     o  Fully supports the Structure of Management Information (SMI)
        as specified in Internet Advisory Board RFC 1065.

     o  Fully supports the Management Information Base (MIB I) as
        specified in Internet Advisory Board RFC 1066.

     In addition, the DECmcc TCP/IP SNMP AM is a fully integrated
     component of DECmcc. The DECmcc Forms and Command Line (FCL)
     user interface allows identification of TCP/IP systems by IP
     address "dot" notation, or by domain name. The DECmcc Alarms
     Function Module and the Configuration Function Module support
     TCP/IP systems as accessed via SNMP.
