     PRODUCT NAME:  IEX-VMS-DRIVER, Version 4.2B         SPD 26.30.07

     DESCRIPTION

     IEX-VMS-DRIVER allows programs written in MACRO-32 and higher
     level languages (such as VAX FORTRAN, VAX BASIC and VAX Pas-
     cal) to communicate through the IEU11-A or IEQ11-A with devices
     containing an IEC 625-1 or IEEE Std. 488 interface. This commu-
     nication is implemented through a choice of direct QIO calls or
     a set of subroutines callable from high level languages.

     Note: In the following description, the term IEX11 stands for
     the IEU11-A and/or IEQ11-A interface. The IEU11-A supports the
     VMS UNIBUS machines, and the IEQ11-A supports the MicroVMS Q-bus
     machines.

     The IEX11-A interface is a bit-parallel byte-serial device which
     can perform transfers in either program interrupt or DMA (Direct
     Memory Access) mode. Program interrupt is used for transferring
     commands and addresses, while DMA is used for transferring data.
     DMA significantly reduces processor loading during the transfer
     of long data buffers.

     The IEX11-A interface contains two independent IEC/
     IEEE bus controllers, also known as General Purpose Interface
     Buses (GPIBs). These two controllers may be connected to the
     same or to different IEC/IEEE buses. Up to 15 devices may be
     attached to each IEC/IEEE bus.

     The IEX11 is most commonly used as Controller-in-Charge, but can
     also be used when another device is Controller-in-Charge. The
     Controller-in-Charge directs the sequence of information on the
     bus.

     When the IEX11 acts as Controller-in-Charge, it may request sta-
     tus information from other devices through serial and parallel
     polling. When the IEX11 is not Controller-in-Charge, it can be
     polled in either fashion to provide status information.

     Features

     The event recognition facility allows the user's process to
     specify the events on the IEC/IEEE instrument bus which the
     interface should detect. The interface is capable of detecting
     the occurrence of the following events:

     o  Service Request*

     o  Addressed as Listener**

     o  Addressed as Talker**

     o  Deaddressed**

     o  Addressed as Extended Listener**

     o  Addressed as Extended Talker**

     *  Functions that can only be used by the Controller-in-Charge

     ** Functions used only by a device that is not Controller-in-
        Charge

     All IEC/IEEE bus commands are issued through a process request
     and all data is transferred through the DMA mechanism. When the
     IEX-VMS-DRIVER is processing a read data request, the three ways
     to detect the end of the data transfer are:

        Byte Count Overflow - Transfer terminates after the specified
        number of bytes have been read.

        EOI Termination - Transfer terminates if, during the recep-
        tion of a byte, the EOI line is true.

        Match Character - Transfer terminates after the Termination
        specified match character has been consecutively received the
        specified number of times.

     A device exerciser is provided to verify that the IEX-VMS-
     DRIVER is correctly installed and to aid the user in testing
     an application. When the two bus controllers are connected with
     a loop back cable (refer to the IEU11-A/IEQ11-A User's Guide),
     the device exerciser can be run with command files delivered
     with the exerciser. These command files demonstrate all features
     of the driver and the IEC/IEEE bus interface functions. The
     device exerciser can also be used by the user in a dialogue
     mode to test devices. The commands to the exerciser are directly
     converted into QIOs to the driver. Using the exerciser in the
     dialogue mode, the user can quickly determine the set of QIOs
     required for an application.

     The IEX-VMS-DRIVER may be programmed in the following two ways:

     VMS and MicroVMS QIO System Service - The VMS QIO requests allow
     direct access to the driver. These requests can be issued in
     higher level languages (such as VAX FORTRAN, VAX BASIC, VAX Pas-
     cal and MACRO-32). This is the most flexible way of programming
     the IEX11 device, but requires the user to be familiar with the
     QIO calling procedures.

     Simplified User Interface - This is a package of subroutines
     which can be called from higher level languages (such as VAX
     FORTRAN and VAX BASIC) to perform the following functions:

     IESTRT  -    Initialize an interface

     IEPOLL  -    Setup for serial polling

     IESEND  -    Send data

     IERECV  -    Receive data

     IERQSV  -    Request service

     IECMD   -    Perform a bus control function

     IEWFE   -    Wait for IEC/IEEE bus event
