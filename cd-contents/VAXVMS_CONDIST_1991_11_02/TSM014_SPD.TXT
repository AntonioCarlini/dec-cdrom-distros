     PRODUCT NAME:  Terminal Server Manager, Version 1.4 SPD 27.64.05

     DESCRIPTION

     Terminal Server Manager VMS (TSM) software will allow suitably
     privileged users at a VAX host to control and observe terminal
     servers anywhere in the extended local area network. TSM pro-
     vides centralization and increased flexibility in configuring,
     monitoring, and controlling Digital Equipment Corporation's
     family of terminal servers.

     TSM V1.4 enhances the previous version, TSM V1.3, by providing
     management support for Digital's newest addition of Terminal
     Server - DECserver 300 V2.0 including Telnet functionality.

     Features

     Telnet Functionality

     TSM V1.4 supports a new set of server commands to provide man-
     agement of the Telnet characteristics of a terminal server.

     Enhanced Prompts

     TSM V1.4 uses prompts that reflect the current context of the
     user's TSM session, whether it be DIRECTORY, SERVER, PARTITION,
     TYPE, or TABLE.

     Management Directory

     TSM provides a directory that contains the name, Ethernet ad-
     dress, terminal server type, and other fields for each server to
     be managed. Through the TSM directory, the user need only refer
     to the name of the server in order to gain access.

     Server Selection

     TSM provides a USE command to allow selection of the server or
     servers to be managed. TSM allows the user to manage from one
     server all of the servers in the directory at a time. The user
     can choose to manage a partition of servers, all servers of a
     specified type, or all servers matching a wildcarded server or
     partition specification.

     Volatile Characteristics

     TSM manages the volatile characteristics for all terminal server
     types.

     Permanent Characteristics

     TSM manages permanent NVRAM characteristics for the DECserver
     100, DECserver 200, DECserver 250, DECserver 300, MUXserver
     100 and MUXserver 300. For the Ethernet Terminal Server and
     DECserver 500, TSM modifies the permanent attributes contained
     within the image files that are down-line loaded.

     Database Manipulation

     TSM can access and manipulate the database associated with each
     server within its jurisdiction, including their characteristics
     and parameters.

     DECnet Database Modification

     TSM automatically updates the DECnet database for servers to
     match the DECnet related information in the management direc-
     tory. Users need no longer employ a separate DSVCONFIG or TSVNCP
     configuration program.

     3270 Option Software

     TSM provides support for the 3270 Option Software for the CXM04
     line card. This line card provides the capability to connect the
     3270 class of terminals to systems on Ethernet.

     Keyboard Mapping

     This functionality enables the terminal server manager to
     customize 3270 keyboard tables supplied with the 3270 Option
     Software by changing the way individual 3270 keyboard keys are
     mapped to Digital's VT220 keys.

     DCL Command

     TSM commands may be issued as DCL commands; the syntax follows
     DCL conventions.

     Command Files

     Command files may be maintained outside TSM (e.g., by use of
     a VAX/VMS editor). This command file support allows values of
     characteristics to be stored on the host, effectively creating
     a copy of the permanent database that may be used to configure
     new servers. Server maintenance is also enhanced by allowing the
     terminal server to be easily box swapped, and parameters reset.
     Up to eight parameters may be passed to TSM command files.
     Additionally, command files may operate on a single server,
     on a logical group (a partition) of servers or on all servers.

     Fault Management

     Troubleshooting within the terminal server network is enhanced
     by TSM providing the ability, centrally, to read traffic status
     and counters in addition to error status and counters. With the
     ``PASTHRU'' command, the user can also connect directly to the
     server without using TSM, allowing isolation of problems between
     TSM and the server.

     A simple connectivity test to a specific server or all servers
     listed in the directory is provided with an informational mes-
     sage displayed for each server not responding. TSM allows the
     user to check periodically for non-functioning terminal servers.
     This function might be performed from within a batch job, to
     run without user involvement, but informing the appropriate
     personnel if a server connectivity problem is detected.

     Via the TEST DELAY command, users can measure timing delays
     associated with data transmission to and from servers.

     The TEST CONNECTION command tests the ability to submit a print
     job to a server port.
