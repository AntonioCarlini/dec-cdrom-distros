           PRODUCT NAME:  DECconcentrator 500 Software Microcode,  SPD 32.29.04
			  Version 3.0

           DESCRIPTION

           DECconcentrator 500 Software Microcode is dedicated microcode
           which runs in the DECconcentrator 500 hardware platform. The
           DECconcentrator 500 is a FDDI concentrator designed to com-
           ply with ANSI X3T9 FDDI standard. It allows customers to con-
           nect FDDI devices such as workstations, servers, systems,
           DECbridge 500, etc., to FDDI ring networks.

           DECconcentrator 500 hardware is shipped from the factory with
           the DECconcentrator 500 Software Microcode preloaded. The
           microcode resides in electronically alterable memory within
           DECconcentrator 500 hardware, and can be updated via down-
           line load if new versions of the microcode are issued. It
           is maintained in the hardware base even during power-off states.

           DECconcentrator 500 hardware is available in modular con-
           figurations. If a device connection fails, it automatically
           bypasses the failed port.

           General characteristics of DECconcentrator 500 Software Mi-
           crocode are:

           o  Performs initialization and bootstrapping.

           o  Performs Diagnostic Selftest automatically at power-up
              and also when initiated by DECelms network management soft-
              ware.

           o  Performs FDDI Station Management (SMT) based on the ANSI
              X3T9 Standard, SMT V6.2.

           o  Holds and updates all the DECconcentrator 500 counters
              and settable parameters.

           o  Supports reception, processing and transmission of re-
              mote network management packets generated by DECelms net-
              work management software, MOP and SMT.

           o  Supports reception, processing and transmission of re-
              mote network management packets generated by SNMP net-
              work management software.

           o  Accepts downline load of new firmware when initiated via
              MOP for upgrades (when Network Management module, DEFCN-
              M, is installed).

           o  Supports both four and six port modules.

           o  Uses Ring Purge algorithm to eliminate no-owner frames.
