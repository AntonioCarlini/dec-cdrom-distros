           PRODUCT NAME:  VAX Distributed Queuing Service, Version 1.2
           SPD 28.80.02

           DESCRIPTION

           The standard VMS queue system enables users to use the VMS
           PRINT command to print files on output devices that are at-
           tached to the user's local VMS node.

           The VAX Distributed Queuing Service (DQS) uses the DECnet
           networking system to extend the standard VMS queue system
           to enable users to:

           o  Print jobs on printers connected to systems other than
              their own

           o  Show the status of jobs on those systems

           o  Cancel their jobs on those systems

           o  Change the specifications of their jobs on those systems

           Any node where a print request originates is called a client.
           Any node with an attached printer that performs the print-
           ing is called a server. Any node with DQS software can be
           configured to operate as only a client or as both a client
           and a server. The DQS software does not limit the number of
           client or server nodes or queues. The system manager cre-
           ates the queues and establishes the correspondence between
           client queues and queues on server nodes. A queue on a server
           node can accept jobs from queues on multiple client nodes.

           VAX Distributed Queuing Service, Version 1.2SPD 28.80.02


           Features

           The following is a summary of features available in the VAX
           Distributed Queuing Service software:

           o  Provides an easy means of printing from systems that do
              not have printers.

           o  The DQS software can be used in any DECnet networking en-
              vironment. Both Local Area Networks and Wide Area Net-
              works are supported.

           o  The DQS software allows multiple VMS systems to share ex-
              pensive or unique printers.

           o  The DQS software does not limit the user's choice of print-
              ing equipment as it can work with standard Digital sym-
              bionts and most user-written or user-modified symbionts.

           o  Provides completely transparent support for the follow-
              ing qualifiers of the VMS PRINT command:

              /BACKUP, /BEFORE, /BURST, /BY_OWNER,
              /CONFIRM, /CHARACTERISTICS, /COPIES,
              /CREATED, /DEVICE, /EXCLUDE, /EXPIRED,
              /FEED, /FLAG, /IDENTIFY, /JOB_COUNT,
              /LOWERCASE, /MODIFIED, /NAME, /NOTE,
              /QUEUE, /REMOTE, /RESTART, /PAGES,
              /PASSALL, /SETUP, /SINCE, /SPACE, /TRAILER, and /USER

              All other VMS PRINT qualifiers are supported, with slight
              differences that reflect the distributed environment of
              DQS.

           o  If the DQS server is temporarily inaccessible when a print
              command is issued, the DQS client will attempt to trans-
              fer the job for printing after the DQS server again be-
              comes available.

           o  If a printer becomes unavailable, the corresponding DQS
              server queue can be configured to direct print jobs to
              a different DQS server queue.

           o  The DQS software can send notification to the user af-
              ter a print job has been completed.

           o  Additional queues can be added and queue attributes changed
              without reinstalling the DQS software.

           o  Additional DQS nodes can be added to an existing network
              of DQS nodes without reinstalling the software on the ex-
              isting nodes.

           o  The DQS software can be configured to limit access to servers.

           o  The DQS software can be configured to keep records of use.

           o  The DQS commands can be used on non-DQS queues.
