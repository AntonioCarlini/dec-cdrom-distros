           PRODUCT NAME:  DECimage Scan Software for VMS, Version 2.1
           SPD 25.D4.02

           DESCRIPTION

           DECimage Scan Software is a DECwindows application for the
           capture, adjustment, and delivery of bitonal (black and white),
           grayscale, and color images. It allows users to set up and
           control supported Image Scanners. Other capabilities include
           scan, preview, adjustment of images, reading and creating
           DDIF image files, and mailing image files. Files created us-
           ing DECimage Scan Software can be used by other applications
           that operate on image files in DDIF (Digital's Document In-
           terchange Format).

           DECimage Scan Software supports the MD300, MD400, and MD410
           Image Scanners. The MD300 scanner requires connection to a
           Q-bus based VAX or VAXstation. The MD400 and MD410 scanners
           require connection to a VAXstation 3100. DECimage Scan Soft-
           ware provides access from any workstation running DECwin-
           dows (VMS or ULTRIX) to a scanner connected to a remote node
           within a DECnet LAN.
