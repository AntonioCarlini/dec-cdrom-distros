     VAX Wide Area Network (WAN) Device Drivers, Version 1.1B SPD 29.64.02



     Refer to Table 1 in the System Support Addendum (SSA 29.64.02-x)
     for details of line speeds for supported protocols and to Table
     2 in the System Support Addendum (SSA 29.64.02-x) for details of
     supported processor and device combinations.

     Hardware Devices

     o  The DSH32 (dual sync line) and DST32 (single sync line) are
        multi-function devices for Busless systems. The communi-
        cations controllers support DMA transfers for bit oriented
        protocols and perform character transmission, reception, and
        framing in microcode.

     o  The DMV11 (Q-bus) is a high performance single line communi-
        cations controller for Q-bus systems. The DMV11 implements
        DDCMP in firmware and supports DMA data transfers and DDCMP
        point-to-point configurations. The DMV11 can support up to
        12 tributaries depending on the operating system and layered
        software.

     o  The DPV11-DA or DPV11-S (Q-bus) and DUP11 (UNIBUS) are char-
        acter interrupt devices for datalink handling. CPU cycles are
        required for data link-level protocol processing and for each
        character sent and received.

     o  The DSV11 (Q-bus) is a dual line synchronous communications
        device for Q-bus systems. The DSV11 supports DMA transfers
        for bit and character oriented protocols. The communications
        controller performs character transmission, reception and
        framing in microcode.

     o  The KMV1A-A or KMV1A-SF (Q-bus) communications controller
        executes transmission, reception, and X.25 LAPB link-level
        protocol processing in microcode. Optional link-level soft-
        ware products, drivers and tools are available for the KMV1A
        device if required. The KMV1A device was previously known as
        the KMV11-A.

     o  The DSF32 (MI-bus) is a multi-function device for VAXft 3000-
        310 fault tolerant systems. The DSF32 provides a dual line
        synchronous capability and supports DMA transfers for bit and
        character oriented protocols. The communications controller
        performs character transmission, reception and framing in
        microcode. The two lines can be used independently to run
        different protocols or can be used to provide a failover
        capability between lines in the event of an application or
        system failure.

     o  The DMB32 (BI-bus) and DMF32 (UNIBUS) are multi-function
        devices which include a single DMA line. The communications
        controllers perform character transmission, reception, and
        framing in microcode.

        For the DMB32, rev.J is required for applications using
        HDLC, SDLC and GENBYTE protocols. In the case of the DMF32,
        only rev. J and later are supported for use with the HDLC
        protocol, and rev. M is required for simultaneous operation
        of the printer port.

     o  The DSB32 (BI-bus) is a dual line synchronous communications
        device for VAXBI systems. The DSB32 supports DMA transfers
        for bit and character oriented protocols. The communications
        controller performs character transmission, reception, and
        framing in microcode.

     o  The DMC11 and DMR11 (UNIBUS) are high performance single
        line communications controllers that provide local or remote
        connections between UNIBUS systems. The DMC11 and DMR11
        implement DDCMP in firmware and support DMA data transfers
        and DDCMP point-to-point configurations.

     o  The KMS1P-A, KMS1P-B and KMS11-B (UNIBUS) products are DMA
        devices. The KMS communications controller executes character
        transmission, reception, and X.25 data link-level protocol
        processing in microcode (LAPB only, for packets not larger
        than 1024 bytes). The VAX CPU then processes the X.25 packet
        level protocol. Optional link-level software products and
        tools available for the KMS devices are not required. The

        KMS1P-A and KMS1P-B were previously known as the KMS11-PX and
        KMS11-PY.

     Notes:

     o  The DSH32 and DST32 are not supported on VAXstation 2000 and
        VAXstation 3100 systems.

     o  The use of UNIBUS options on a VAXBI system with a UNIBUS
        Adapter is not supported unless specified in Table 2 of this
        Software Product Description.

     o  The DMB32, DMF32, and DSH32 are multi-function devices. Only
        the Device Driver for the synchronous ports are included in
        the VAX WAN Device Drivers.

     o  The DMB32 must be revision J or later for applications using
        GENBYTE, HDLC or SDLC protocols.

     o  The DMF32 must be revision J or later for applications using
        HDLC protocol.

     The VAX WAN Device Drivers includes Device Drivers that are
     reserved for use by Digital software products as well as Device
     Drivers that offer a supported User ($QIO) interface. Table
     2 of this SPD lists the Device Driver characteristics. The
     table entries indicate the maximum permitted line speeds in
     kilobits/second for each of the line protocols supported by the
     individual drivers.

     The Device Drivers all support full duplex and half duplex oper-
     ation, where appropriate to the protocol. DDCMP and SDLC Device
     drivers all support both point-to-point and multipoint tribu-
     tary operation. `Bisync' refers to the IBM[R] implementation of
     bisynchronous protocol. The Genbyte protocol is a general byte-
     orientated protocol for use with User-written framing routines.

     The maximum permitted line speed depends on the line interface
     standard used and must not exceed 19.2 Kbps for an RS232/V.24
     standard interface. There may be additional line speed restric-
     tions for other line interface standards: refer to the product

     descriptions for the synchronous interfaces for more infor-
     mation. The Digital communications layered products may not
     necessarily support operation of the synchronous interface at
     the maximum speed supported by the device driver. Refer to the
     appropriate Software Product Description for the Digital com-
     munications layered product for precise details of supported
     configurations.

     In all cases, the data throughput over the synchronous lines is
     dependent on the user applications and system environment.

     The device drivers all support modem control signal opera-
     tion. Refer to the product descriptions for the appropriate
     synchronous interface for details of the modem signals supported
     by an individual device.
