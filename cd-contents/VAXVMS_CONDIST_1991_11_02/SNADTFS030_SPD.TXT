           PRODUCT NAME:  DECnet/SNA Data Transfer Facility,     SPD
           27.85.03                Version 3.0

           DESCRIPTION

           The DECnet/SNA® Data Transfer Facility (DTF) is a layered
           software product that provides data transfer capabilities
           between IBM® MVS and IBM VM systems in a Systems Network Ar-
           chitecture (SNA) environment and Digital DECnet nodes in a
           DECnet network. DTF supports the following DECnet nodes: VMS
           systems running DECnet-VAX, RSX-11M-PLUS systems running DECnet-11M-PLUS,
           ULTRIX systems running DECnet-ULTRIX, MS-DOS® systems run-
           ning PATHWORKS for DOS, and OS/2® systems running PATHWORKS
           for OS/2. Access between the cooperating Digital and IBM en-
           vironments is provided by a DECnet/SNA Gateway or by VMS/SNA
           software.

           The following briefly highlights the features of DTF. More
           detailed information is given in the Features section. Un-
           less otherwise mentioned, these features are supported on
           both MVS and VM systems.

           Client/Server-Style Operation:

           The DTF product provides a client/server style of operation.
           The VMS/DTF server can support file operations between IBM
           MVS and VM clients and DECnet VMS, ULTRIX, RSX-11M-PLUS, MS-DOS,
           and OS/2 clients. No additional software besides DECnet soft-
           ware is required on the DECnet clients (except for VMS re-
           coverable copy operations). See the Configuration section
           for more information.

           Ease of Use:

                                                         AE-KL24D-TE

 



           DECnet/SNA Data Transfer Facility,          SPD 27.85.03
           Version 3.0

           DTF provides a familiar user interface for both Digital (VMS,
           MS-DOS, OS/2, ULTRIX, and RSX-11M-PLUS DECnet nodes) and IBM
           users. This feature supports easy application development
           and reduces staff training.

           Comprehensive, Bidirectional Access from All Supported Clients:

           The DTF product enables bidirectional file transfer between
           all DTF-supported DECnet nodes and IBM MVS and VM systems.

           Checkpoint and Recovery:

           DTF provides VMS and IBM users with checkpoint and recov-
           ery support in the event of a system or network failure. This
           feature allows DTF to resume an interrupted recoverable copy
           operation when the network returns to a normal state. This
           saves significant time and system resources when large files
           are transferred.

           File Backup:

           DTF allows VMS and ULTRIX users to target IBM disks and tapes
           for backup and restore operations. In large co-resident DEC
           and IBM sites, this capability optimizes system resource us-
           age.

           Remote Job Submission:

           DTF users can submit jobs remotely from all DECnet clients
           (VMS, RSX-11M-PLUS, MS-DOS, OS/2, and ULTRIX).

           Post-Processing:

           Using DTF, VMS and IBM users can provide a post-processing
           file to be executed after a file transfer is completed. This
           feature allows VMS and IBM users to logically connect the
           running of a batch job to the successful completion of a DTF
           file transfer. This makes the implementation of distributed
           processing functions significantly easier to synchronize be-
           tween IBM applications and VAX DECnet-based applications.

           Version 3.0

           Record-Level Access:

           DTF supports record-level access from VMS systems to IBM MVS
           and VM systems.

           Supported File Types:

           DTF supports multiple file types (RMS, VSAM, BSAM, CMS), al-
           lowing easy applications development.

           HSM Support:

           DTF supports IBM's Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM) fa-
           cility. This is a DTF for MVS only feature.

           IBM Enterprise Architecture and SMS Support:

           DTF runs in compliance with IBM's Enterprise Architecture
           and will support SMS-managed data sets (refer to the Sup-
           ported IBM Configurations section). This is a DTF for MVS
           only feature.

           Data Translation Using Load Balancing and Performance Tun-
           ing:

           DTF supports text translation from DMCS (Digital Multina-
           tional Character Set, a superset of ASCII) to EBCDIC and vice
           versa on a record-by-record basis. DTF supports load bal-
           ancing and performance tuning between both the IBM system
           and the VMS/DTF server node by allowing users to select which
           system performs the text translation. Enhanced performance
           of the VMS/DTF server often results when this translation
           is performed on the IBM system. DTF also supports, through
           the VAX Common Data Dictionary product, field-level trans-
           lation.

           Data Security:

           DECnet/SNA Data Transfer Facility,          SPD 27.85.03
           Version 3.0

           DTF controls access and protects valuable data with supe-
           rior security capabilities. DTF supports the following industry-
           standard security interfaces that run on IBM machines: RACF,
           CA-ACF2[TM], SAF, and VMSECURE[TM].

           Server Management:

           The DTF product includes a management utility to manage the
           VMS/DTF server.

           Event Logging:

           DTF for IBM logs events which can be used for historical in-
           quiry or accounting. System programmers can easily write spe-
           cialized accounting and bill-back reports using DTF's logs.
           This is a DTF for MVS only feature.

           Components

           There are four components to the DECnet/SNA Data Transfer
           Facility product:

           o  Data Transfer Facility server (VMS/DTF server) software

           o  Data Transfer Facility utilities (VMS/DTF utilities) soft-
              ware

           o  Data Transfer Facility for IBM MVS system (DTF for MVS)
              software

           o  Data Transfer Facility for IBM VM system (DTF for VM) soft-
              ware

           VMS/DTF Server Software:

           The VMS/DTF server software can be installed on any VMS sys-
           tem in a DECnet network containing a DECnet/SNA Gateway or
           on any VMS system running VMS/SNA. The node that is running
           the VMS/DTF server software is referred to as the server node.
           All DTF file requests go through this server node which com-
           municates with the appropriate DTF for IBM system by using

                                       4

           Version 3.0

           a DECnet/SNA Gateway or by using VMS/SNA software. The server
           software also performs text translation (DMCS/EBCDIC). How-
           ever, this can be done optionally by the DTF for IBM soft-
           ware. The VAX Common Data Dictionary (CDD) product is re-
           quired on the VMS/DTF server node for the translation of data
           types other than DMCS/EBCDIC. The VMS/DTF server software
           includes the VMS/DTF utilities software described in the next
           section.

           VMS/DTF Utilities Software:

           The VMS/DTF utilities software is an optional component that
           can be installed on any VMS system where users wish to trans-
           fer files using the recoverable copy feature. The utilities
           software should also be installed if IBM users will be re-
           questing recoverable copies involving that VMS node. The util-
           ities software consists of a server management utility and
           a checkpoint/recovery utility (TRANSFER/DTF). The VMS/DTF
           utilities software communicates with the VMS/DTF server soft-
           ware to accomplish the data transfer. It is not necessary
           to install the VMS/DTF utilities software on the server node
           since these utilities are included in the VMS/DTF server soft-
           ware package.

           DTF for MVS Software:

           The DTF for MVS software can be installed on any IBM S/370-
           class machine system running the MVS operating system. DTF
           for MVS accepts file operation commands from the VMS/DTF server
           software and maps them into MVS file commands to perform the
           operation. It also provides interfaces so TSO users can is-
           sue recoverable and non-recoverable copy commands in inter-
           active or batch mode. DTF for MVS software consists of two
           parts: a VTAM application program that controls the commu-
           nications with the VMS/DTF server nodes for the purpose of
           transferring files, and user interfaces. The three user in-
           terfaces are: a TSO command processor, a single-line com-
           mand interface (REXX required), and an ISPF dialog.

           Version 3.0

           DTF for VM Software:

           The DTF for IBM VM software can be installed on any IBM S
           /370-class machine system running the VM operating system.
           DTF for VM accepts file operation commands from the VMS/DTF
           server software and maps them into VM file commands to per-
           form the operation. It also provides interfaces so CMS users
           can issue recoverable and non-recoverable copy commands in
           interactive or batch mode. DTF for VM software consists of
           three parts: a VTAM application program that controls the
           communications with the VMS/DTF server, a CMS application
           for the purpose of transferring files, and user interfaces.
           The three user interfaces are: a TSO command processor, a
           single-line command interface (REXX required), and an ISPF
           dialog.

           Configuration

           A DTF for IBM component must be installed on each IBM sys-
           tem with which users want to communicate. The DECnet net-
           work requires one VMS/DTF server component installed on a
           VMS system, and may require multiple server component in-
           stallations depending on the amount of use of DTF. All other
           nodes in the DECnet network, including VMS, ULTRIX, MS-DOS,
           OS/2, and RSX, do not require any additional software since
           DTF allows users to use standard DECnet file transfer com-
           mands to access IBM files. The VMS/DTF utilities software
           is required only if a particular VMS system's users need the
           recoverable copy feature or if IBM users desire recoverable
           copy operations to that VMS system. Recoverable copy works
           only to VMS nodes with the VMS/DTF server software or the
           VMS/DTF utilities software installed.

           Version 3.0

           Features

           Ease of Use:

           The DTF product uses a variety of familiar user interfaces
           to make users more productive. Users do not have to learn
           new commands and procedures.

           Users in the VMS environment can issue standard DCL commands,
           like COPY, TYPE, DIRECTORY, and so on. Alternatively, they
           can use the Record Management System (RMS) programming in-
           terface or the TRANSFER/DTF utility for data exchange be-
           tween DECnet and IBM systems.

           IBM MVS users can access and transfer data by using the TSO
           DTF command processor, the TSO ISPF panels, or the single-
           line interface. IBM VM users can use the CMS DTF command pro-
           cessor, the CMS ISPF panels or the single-line interface.
           The TSO and CMS command processors can also be invoked in
           batch mode.

           ULTRIX users access files by using the standard DECnet-ULTRIX
           file transfer commands. MS-DOS and OS/2 users simply issue
           the standard PATHWORKS for DOS or PATHWORKS for OS/2 NFT com-
           mands. RSX-11M-PLUS users can use DCL commands or DECnet-11M-PLUS
           NFT and FTS commands.

           DTF Access from VMS Clients:

           VMS DTF users can initiate non-recoverable or recoverable,
           bidirectional file transfers between IBM DTF clients and them-
           selves. DTF supports the following VMS DCL commands. Note
           that some of the qualifiers associated with these DCL com-
           mands are subject to restrictions when used with DTF.

           RSX-11M-PLUS DTF users can initiate non-recoverable, bidi-
           rectional file transfers between IBM clients and themselves.
           RSX-11M-PLUS users can use all three network file transfer
           interfaces provided by DECnet-11M-PLUS (NFT, DCL, FTS). DTF
           supports the following DECnet-11M-PLUS DCL commands. Note
           that some of these commands are subject to restrictions when
           used with DTF.

           APPEND       DELETE      SUBMIT/REMOTE

           DTF Access from MS-DOS and OS/2 Clients:

           MS-DOS and OS/2 DTF users can initiate non-recoverable, bidi-
           rectional file transfers between IBM DTF clients and them-
           selves. IBM-initiated file transfers are supported by MS-DOS
           and OS/2 systems when the PATHWORKS for DOS or PATHWORKS for
           OS/2 File Access Listener (FAL) is running. DTF supports the
           following PATHWORKS for DOS and PATHWORKS for OS/2 NFT com-
           mands. Note that some of these commands are subject to re-
           strictions when used with DTF.

           APPEND       DELETE      SUBMIT

           COPY         DIRECTORY   TYPE

           DTF Access from ULTRIX Clients:

           ULTRIX DTF users can initiate non-recoverable, bidirectional
           file transfers between DTF for IBM systems and themselves.
           DTF supports the following DECnet-ULTRIX commands. Note that
           some of these commands are subject to restrictions when used
           with DTF.

           DTF Access from IBM Clients:

           IBM DTF users can initiate non-recoverable or recoverable,
           bidirectional file transfers between VMS DTF clients run-
           ning the VMS/DTF utilities software and themselves. In ad-
           dition, they can initiate non-recoverable, bidirectional file
           transfer between all other DTF clients (including other IBM
           systems) and themselves. MVS TSO users and VM CMS users have
           the following commands available to transfer files to or from
           other DTF clients.

           mand         panels      panels
           processor

           Checkpoint and Recovery:

           Checkpoint and recovery capabilities assure that data re-
           mains accurate and intact, even in the event of system or
           network failure. When VMS users transfer files using the TRANS-
           FER/DTF utility, it automatically resumes an interrupted file
           transfer process with no loss of data when communications
           between sending and receiving systems are re-established.
           Checkpoint and recovery is supported for non-VSAM and CMS
           files that are disk- or tape-resident. Checkpoint and re-
           covery is not supported on VSAM files.

           IBM users have a similar checkpoint and recovery feature.
           A recoverable copy operation performed from an IBM system
           sets environment variables (CLIST in MVS, REXX in VM). If
           the transfer terminates with a network error, these vari-
           ables contain information to allow the user to resume the
           transfer.

           File Backup:

           DECnet/SNA Data Transfer Facility,          SPD 27.85.03
           Version 3.0

           DTF allows VMS users to back up and restore their disks di-
           rectly to IBM tapes or disks using the VMS BACKUP command.
           ULTRIX users can also back up and restore disks to IBM tapes
           or disks.

           Remote Job Submission:

           VMS, ULTRIX, DOS, OS/2, and RSX-11M-PLUS users can submit
           JCL or REXX files on the IBM system to be executed by JES
           or by a batch machine. These users can use the standard DEC-
           net file operation commands to initiate the job submission.
           For example, VMS users use SUBMIT/REMOTE and ULTRIX users
           use dcp -S. Users will not get the status of the job com-
           pletion. IBM DTF users can submit jobs by using the post-
           processing feature described in the next section.

           Post-Processing:

           Post-processing is the ability to submit a DCL command pro-
           cedure or MVS JCL or VM REXX procedure after a file trans-
           fer is completed. IBM users can use the post-processing fea-
           ture from either the command processor or the panel inter-
           face. VMS users can use the post-processing feature only through
           the TRANSFER/DTF utility.

           Record-Level Access:

           DTF allows a VMS user record-level access to IBM files by
           means of an RMS application, DCL commands, or DATATRIEVE.
           DTF does not support record-level access initiated from IBM
           to VMS RMS files.

           Supported File Types:

           All VMS file types, RSX-11M-PLUS sequential files, and UL-
           TRIX, MS-DOS, and OS/2 stream files are supported. MS-DOS
           and OS/2 support only stream files. Therefore, all files copied
           to MS-DOS or OS/2 systems result in stream files. All files
           copied from MS-DOS and OS/2 systems result in sequential data
           sets on IBM systems.

           DECnet/SNA Data Transfer Facility,          SPD 27.85.03
           Version 3.0

           For IBM MVS systems, supported non-VSAM file types are those
           with the physical sequential data set organization. This in-
           cludes normal sequential files as well as partitioned data
           set members. Both disk-resident and tape-resident non-VSAM
           files are supported. Supported VSAM file types include entry-
           sequenced data sets (ESDS), relative-record data sets (RRDS),
           and key-sequenced data sets (KSDS).

           For IBM VM systems, supported CMS file types are those with
           the physical sequential data set organization. This includes
           normal sequential files as well as MACLIB members. Both disk-
           resident and tape-resident files are supported and can be
           transferred. Supported DOS/VSE VSAM file types include entry-
           sequenced data sets (ESDS), relative-record data sets (RRDS),
           and key-sequenced data sets (KSDS). VM does not support cre-
           ating empty files or creating null records in a file. DTF
           provides an option for users to overcome the null record re-
           striction by substituting a record containing a character
           or value chosen by the user.

           HSM Support:

           DTF for MVS supports the Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM)
           facility and allows users to recall migrated data sets. IBM
           system programmers can tailor the number of concurrent out-
           standing HSM requests as well as device recall capability.

           SMS Support:

           DTF for MVS supports the MVS Storage Management Subsystem
           (SMS) facility.

           Data Translation:

           DTF provides three options for data translation: no data trans-
           lation at all, DMCS (Digital Multinational Character Set,
           a superset of ASCII) to EBCDIC and vice versa, and field-
           level translation.

           Version 3.0

           o  Users can specify that DTF should perform no data trans-
              lation during a file transfer. This option is useful for
              transferring image files.

           o  By default, DTF performs data translation from DMCS to
              EBCDIC and vice versa on a record-by-record basis. This
              is the option normally used to transfer text files.

           o  Users can specify that DTF use alternate field-level trans-
              lation. In this case, the VMS/DTF server software trans-
              lates data types such as binary, integer, floating point,
              packed decimal, and numeric strings using VAX Common Data
              Dictionary (CDD/Plus) record definitions supplied by the
              user. The semantics of data in the file is maintained across
              a file transfer. The CDD/Plus product is required on the
              VMS/DTF server node for alternate field-level data trans-
              lation.

           By default, data translation is performed on the VMS/DTF server
           node. To decrease the load on the VMS/DTF server, the server
           manager can optionally specify that data translation (DMCS
           /EBCDIC) occur on the IBM DTF client.

           Data Security:

           Files on the IBM system are accessible only to Digital users
           who know the valid access control information. DTF for IBM
           provides interfaces into the CA-ACF2, RACF, and VMSECURE se-
           curity systems and a standard user exit for other security
           mechanisms (such as CA-TOPSECRET[TM]) through the System Au-
           thorization Facility (SAF) interface. For Digital systems,
           security is maintained by using the standard file protec-
           tion mechanism provided by the base operating system.

           Security is also enhanced in both the Digital and the IBM
           environments through the use of a proxy database on the VMS
           /DTF server node. This database allows VMS, MS-DOS, OS/2,
           RSX-11M-PLUS, and ULTRIX users to avoid entering IBM pass-
           words on the command line.

           DECnet/SNA Data Transfer Facility,          SPD 27.85.03
           Version 3.0

           DTF also allows DECnet-style proxy information to be stored
           on the IBM system using standard IBM system security pack-
           ages (CA-ACF2, RACF). This feature is available only in DTF
           for MVS software.

           For ease of use, DTF for IBM allows users to perform file
           transfers without having to provide passwords for their files
           located on their own IBM system.

           Server Management:

           VMS/DTF provides a management utility to manage the server
           account database, the file definition database, and the DTF
           proxy databases on the VMS/DTF server. The server account
           database allows the server to support file transfer requests
           to many different IBM DTF clients. The file definition database
           allows users to store the IBM file specifications for fre-
           quently accessed files. The proxy database allows the server
           manager to set up mappings that allow users to enter requests
           without specifying their IBM passwords. Refer to the Data
           Security section for more information.

           Event Logging:

           DTF for IBM logs events which can be used for historical in-
           quiry or for accounting usage. Historical logging can be used
           to characterize the use of DTF for IBM. Such information is
           necessary for decisions involving operating hours, perfor-
           mance tuning, and load analysis of the network and operat-
           ing system. Account logging allows users of DTF for IBM func-
           tions to be recorded along with the resources they consume.
           The granularity of the information is sufficient to provide
           a bill-back capability. Implementation of the accounting and
           billing capability is handled with a user exit and can be
           customized on a per-site basis. This feature is supported
           in DTF for MVS software only.
