          PRODUCT NAME:  DRB32 VMS DRIVERS, Version 3.0       SPD 27.69.02

          DESCRIPTION

          DRB32 VMS DRIVERS, Version 3.0 supports the DRB32 options
          (DRB32-M, DRB32-E, and DRB32-W) under the VMS Operating System.
          The DRB32-M is a general purpose parallel port that provides a
          32-bit high speed interface between the VAXBI and a user's pe-
          ripheral. In DMA mode, the DRB32-M can transfer up to 960K bytes
          of data without processor intervention. The DRB32-M also sup-
          ports programmed I/O data transfers between a VAX processor and
          an external device. The DRB32-E an external cable driving option
          allows for communications with a device outside the system cabi-
          net. The DRB32-W a DR11-W compatible option provides DR11-W like
          transactions, so that existing DR11-W applications may utilize
          the higher band-width provided by the VAXBI.

          DRB32 VMS DRIVERS, Version 3.0 provides device drivers and other
          programs that support the DRB32 under VMS V5.0 on VAXBI systems.
          Included in the kit are:

          o  Two working example device drivers; one for the DRB32-
             M/DRB32-E, and one for the DRB32-W

          o  Example programs that demonstrate the use of the drivers and
             provide test and installation verification procedures

          o  Sources to all the above, and command procedures to compile
             or assemble, and link them, along with command procedures
             that load the device drivers

          DRB32 VMS DRIVERS, Version 3.0                      SPD 27.69.02



          DRB32-M/DRB32-E Driver Features

          o  Simple interface for user programs, via the $QIO VMS system
             service. This service can be called from any VMS-supported
             programming language.

          o  Allows users to pre-lock buffers in memory, reducing driver
             overhead when processing user requests

          o  Allows users to transfer very large amounts of data, much
             larger than the DRB32's 982K bytes, by making use of the
             DRB32's double-buffering capability in longword mode trans-
             fers.

          o  Allows users to set up an attention AST, which gives a user
             program asynchronous notification of external device events

          o  Allows a user program to implement its own data transfer
             protocol, between the user program and the external device.
             The driver imposes no restrictions on this protocol.

          o  ``Pipelines'' user I/O requests. This keeps the DRB32 and the
             external device as busy as possible by overlapping driver and
             user program overhead with data transfers.

          o  Allows programmed I/O to either the DRB32's data port, con-
             trol port, or both. This allows a user program to read or
             write a longword or word at a time from or to the user de-
             vice.

          o  Allows a suitably privileged user program to change the
             DRB32's configuration. The user program can select the
             data path width, the Interrupt Priority Level at which the
             DRB32 will interrupt the processor, whether or not the DRB32
             receives and checks parity from the external device, and
             whether or not the DRB32 will operate in internal loop-back
             mode.

          The DRB32-W driver is a modified version of the VMS DR11-W
          driver, with a nearly identical user QIO interface. Existing
          programs for the DR11-W may require modification to use the
          DRB32-W driver. The sources to this driver are provided, so
          that the user has an example of how to modify the DR11-W de-
          vice handling to use the DRB32-W. Systems that are upgraded to
          the T1023-YA version of the DRB32-W board will be able to use
          the word counter functionality included in the example driver
          source, UQWDRIVER, if so desired. An explanation of how to im-
          plement that functionality is also included in the source code.

          HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

          VAX configuration as specified in the System Support Addendum
          (SSA 27.69.02-x).
