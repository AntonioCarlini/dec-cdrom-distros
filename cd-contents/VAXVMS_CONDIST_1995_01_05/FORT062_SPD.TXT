 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC Fortran for OpenVMS                 SPD 25.16.44

 This  Software  Product   Description  describes  the  following  two
 products:

 o  DEC Fortran Version 6.2 for OpenVMS VAX Systems

 o  DEC Fortran Version 6.1 for OpenVMS AXP Systems

 The general description section describes  features  common  to  both
 products.  The differences in  product functionality are indicated in
 separate sections that follow.

 DESCRIPTION

 DEC Fortran  is  an  implementation  of  full   language  FORTRAN-77,
 conforming to American National Standard FORTRAN, ANSI X3.9-1978.  It
 includes  optional  support  for programs conforming to the  previous
 standard, ANSI X3.9-1966.  DEC Fortran meets the Federal  Information
 Processing   Standard  Publication  (FIPS-69-1)    requirements    by
 conforming to the ANSI Standard  and  by  including  a  flagger.  The
 flagger  optionally  produces  diagnostic  messages for  compile-time
 elements that do not conform to the Full-Level ANSI FORTRAN X3.9-1978
 Standard.   DEC Fortran also conforms to the  International  Standard
 ISO 1539-1980(E) and to MIL-STD 1753.

 DEC Fortran includes the following enhancements to the ANSI standard:

 o  Directives  to  control  listing page titles and subtitles, object
    file identification field, and some attributes of common blocks

 o  Composite data  declarations  using  STRUCTURE, END STRUCTURE, and
    RECORD statements, and  access  to record components through field
    references

                               DIGITAL                    March 1994

    Language-Sensitive    Editor   component    and    cross-reference
    information to the DEC  Source  Code  Analyzer component of DECset
    for OpenVMS

 Each  Fortran  compiler  provides a  multi-phase  optimizer  that  is
 capable of performing optimizations across entire program units.

 Specific optimizations performed include:

 o  Constant folding

 o  Optimizations of arithmetic IF, logical IF, and block IF-THEN-ELSE

                                  4

 

 For OpenVMS VAX Systems, the RTL images are designated as FORRTL.EXE,
 MTHRTL.EXE,    UVMTHRTL.EXE,  and  VMTHRTL.EXE.    Three  of    these
 (MTHRTL.EXE,  UVMTHRTL.EXE,  and  VMTHRTL.EXE)  must  be  distributed
 together in order to ensure proper execution behavior.

 For  OpenVMS  AXP    systems,   the  RTL  images  are  designated  as
 DEC$FORRTL.EXE.

 DEC Fortran for OpenVMS VAX Systems Special Features

 DEC  Fortran  for  OpenVMS    VAX   Systems  includes  the  following
 enhancements to the ANSI standard:

 o  REAL*16 data types

 o  Directives  to  support  parallel  decomposition  of  DO-loops  on
    multiprocessor OpenVMS VAX systems

 o  Language elements that support the VAX extended range and extended
    precision floating point architectural features:

    -  64-bit G_floating data type, with an 11-bit exponent and 53-bit
       mantissa,    which    provides  a  range  of  0.56*10**-308  to
       0.09*10**308 and a precision of 15 decimal digits

    -  128-bit  H_floating  data  type,  with a 15-bit exponent and  a
       113-bit  mantissa,  which provides a range of 0.84*10**-4932 to
       0.59*10**4932 and a precision of 33 decimal digits


 DEC Fortran for OpenVMS VAX Systems supports the following additional
 features:

 o  The  /ERROR_LIMIT  qualifier    to   control  whether  compilation
    terminates after a specified number of errors has been found

 o  Generation  of optional diagnostic  messages  for  extensions  not
    supported by Digital's ULTRIX and VAXELN operating systems

 o  The  ability  to provide diagnostics  for  language  features  not
    supported by DEC Fortran on AXP platforms.

 o  Support for translation of CDD/Repository (refers  to VAX CDD, VAX
    CDD/Plus, and CDD/Repository) records into Fortran records

                                  5

 

 o  Up to 255 actual arguments in a CALL statement

 o  Up to 508 named COMMON blocks per subprogram

 o  I/O unit numbers can be any integer  value  in  the range of 0 and
    119

 o  Support for low-level program design, including the processing  of
    pseudocode and the extraction of design information from comments

 o  Support  for   NTT  Technical  Requirement  TR550001,  Multivendor
    Integration Architecture (MIA)  Version 1.1, Division 2, Part 3-2,
    Programming Language Fortran

 o  Reporting of unused variables

 DEC Fortran for OpenVMS VAX  Systems  has  additional  features  that
 support developing applications that take advantage of the VAX vector
 processors or multiprocessor VAX systems.

 An ASSERT statement provides additional information to  the  compiler
 about the program.  The ASSERT statement can be used in some programs
 to    achieve   a  high  degree  of  vectorization  and/or  automatic
 decomposition.   The ASSERT statement can optionally generate code to
 verify the assertions at run time, if desired.  ASSERT statements can
 be specified in directive form for portability and will be ignored by
 other compilers since they will appear as comments.

 The INIT_DEP_FWD directive allows  vector  processing  for many loops
 that would otherwise not qualify  due  to  unknown data dependencies.
 As this directive may change the  meaning  of  the  program,  Digital
 Equipment  Corporation does not warrant execution results  conforming
 to the Fortran standard when this directive is used.

 Vector  and  multiprocessor  features  supported  by  DEC Fortran  on
 OpenVMS VAX Systems include:

 o  Directives  to  support  parallel  decomposition  of  DO-loops  on
    multiprocessor OpenVMS VAX systems

 o  Support  for    automatic    generation  of  VAX  vector-processor
    instructions

                                  6

 

 o  Support  for  automatic   decomposition  of  programs  to  improve
    performance on multiple-processor OpenVMS VAX systems

 o  The NOVECTOR directive to  allow  the  programmer  to  control the
    presence and level of vectorization in each nest of DO-loops

 o  The  /MATH_LIBRARY  qualifier  to  support  performance  optimized
    vector math functions

 o  The  /CHECK=ALIGNMENT  qualifier  to  suppress  vector   alignment
    exceptions at run time

 o  Generation of diagnostics for vectorization inhibitors

    -  Though some vector inhibition diagnostics will display  in  the
       listing and on the terminal, the DEC Language-Sensitive  Editor
       component  of the DEC Language-Sensitive Editor/DEC Source Code
       Analyzer is  required  to  display  all  the  vector inhibition
       diagnostics generated by the compiler.

 o  Vectorization of DO  loops  with both INTEGER*4 and INTEGER*2 loop
    control variables

 o  Vectorization of most intrinsic  mathematic functions for operands
    of INTEGER*4, REAL*4, REAL*8, COMPLEX*8, and COMPLEX*16 types

 Parallel Processing Hardware Requirements:

 Multiprocessor VAX  systems  are  required  for  proper  execution of
 decomposed DO-loops.   However,  applications that are compiled using
 the DEC Fortran parallel  processing  options  will  run  on  all VAX
 processors for reasons of compatibility.

 Vector Processing Hardware Requirements

 Vector-processor  equipped  VAX  systems  are   required  for  proper
 execution  of vectorized DO-loops.  However,  applications  that  are
 compiled  using  the vector-processing options will run  on  all  VAX
 processors,  using  the  VAX  Vector  Instruction  Emulation Facility
 (VVIEF) that is supplied with OpenVMS.  Execution using the VVIEF may
 be significantly slower than recompiling for scalar execution.
