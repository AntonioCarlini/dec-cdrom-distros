          PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER Save Set Manager for OpenVMS, Version 1.0,
          SPD 62.64.01

          DESCRIPTION

          The POLYCENTER Save Set Manager for OpenVMS (SSMgr) is a layered soft-
          ware product that reduces user time spent on save set operations. The
          SSMgr reduces operational time spent during OpenVMS BACKUP operations
          by providing an avenue for offline data verification, copy, and save
          set merge functions.

          The key benefits of the POLYCENTER Save Set Manager for OpenVMS are:

          o  Reduction of operational time spent on online backup and restore
             without compromising data integrity

          o  Selective manipulation of save set contents and attributes

          o  Transfer of backup save sets between tape drive technologies

          o  Transfer of backup save sets from one tape or disk drive to another
             tape or disk drive while maintaining data integrity features

          o  Reduced down time for a BACKUP/RESTORE operation

          o  Ability to monitor degradation of archived save sets

          There are three separate and distinct functions in the SSMgr, Version
          1.0. They are:

          1. Save Set VALIDATE-This function verifies the internal consistency
             of a specified save set offline and reports any exceptions back to
             the user.

          2. Save Set COPY-This function provides the ability to duplicate the
             save set with the addition/deletion of CRC or XOR blocks in the out-
             put save set and eliminates any duplicate records.

          3. Save Set MERGE-This function provides the ability to merge incre-
             mental save sets with other incremental or full save sets, reduc-
             ing the frequency of full BACKUP operations.

          Processor Restrictions

          The MicroVAX 2000 and VAXstation 2000 systems require a TK50 for a load
          device.

          A minimum system configuration to run Save Set Manager (SSM) includes:

          o  Recommended: Same or greater amount of memory as the system on which
             the save sets were originally created

          o  One or more disk or tape drives supported by OpenVMS

          Processor Restrictions:

          Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1):

          POLYCENTER Save Set Manager for OpenVMS, Version 1.0, SPD 62.64.01



          Disk space required for      1500 blocks
          installation:
                                       (750 Kbytes)

          Disk space required for      500 blocks
          use (permanent):
                                       (250 K bytes)

          These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
          sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
          system environment, configuration, and software options.

          OPTIONAL DEVICE HARDWARE
