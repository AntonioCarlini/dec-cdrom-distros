           PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER System Watchdog, Version 2.2 SPD 41.42.04

           DESCRIPTION

           POLYCENTER System Watchdog is a layered software product which auto-
           matically monitors events and problems on selected nodes in the net-
           work. When a problem is detected, POLYCENTER System Watchdog can re-
           spond in several ways: send notification, issue corrective response
           actions, and log the events for future reference. From a single ter-
           minal or workstation, operations staff can monitor, respond and man-
           age multiple dispersed systems over the wide area network and across
           multivendor platforms.

           POLYCENTER System Watchdog consists of two components: a CONSOLIDA-
           TOR and an AGENT. An Agent is installed on each node which requires
           monitoring, and periodically scans the system, the devices and data
           structures attached to the system for events and problems. When an event
           is detected, this information is sent to the node installed with the
           Consolidator, which then carries out the pre-determined action and no-
           tification. The Consolidator node, aside from receiving and handling
           Agent-reported events, also periodically attempts to connect through
           the network to the Agent nodes, and detect any network, node avail-
           ability, or Agent events in the process. The design of the Consolida-
           tor/Agent architecture makes POLYCENTER System Watchdog scaleable and
           supportive of client/server environments.

           POLYCENTER System Watchdog supports the Consolidator component on the
           following platforms:

           o  DEC OSF/1 AXP

           o  OpenVMS AXP

           o  OpenVMS VAX

           o  Connection problems

           o  Events with user-supplied text reported through command procedures
              or user applications

           MODULES AND FUNCTIONALITY

           Consolidator (UNIX) modules:

           o  CONTROL module interface sends requests and gathers reported events
              from the Agents. With a command oriented CONTROL module, the main
              functions necessary to drive the central Consolidator can be im-
              plemented.

           o  PRESENTATION module interface provides an information display in-
              terface for non-graphics terminals or through the following exter-
              nal applications:

              o  POLYCENTER Netview

              o  POLYCENTER Console Manager

              o  TeMIP Framework V2.0

              o  POLYCENTER Network Manager 400/200

              o  Topology Control Window for ULTRIX (TCWX)

           o  FUNCTION module interface provides actions triggering such as send-
              ing mail and executing shell scripts.

           Consolidator (OpenVMS) modules:

           o  SNS$CONSOLIDATOR detached process polls the Agents and requests for
              active event messages and maintains a composite list. Also invokes
              action routines, notification, and logs the events.

           o  SNS$CONTROL interactive process invoked at the DCL prompt. It pro-
              vides the operator interface to display and update event messages.

                                            5

           o  SNS$PROFILE.DAT is a data file which defines the list of Agent nodes
              to poll, the conditions and threshold values to monitor, and types
              of notification and actions to be performed upon specific events.

           Agent (UNIX) modules:

           o  Event Sensors check the monitored node for events, and can run in
              PERMANENT mode (continuously) or in CRON mode (run when required).
              Unlimited number of event sensors can be used.

           o  Event Sensor Manager supervises the event sensors.

           o  Agent Server manages communications between the Agent and Consol-
              idators.

           Agent (OpenVMS) modules:

           o  SNS$WATCHDOG detached process scans devices and data structures for
              events and conditions, and maintains the local problem list.

           o  SNS$CONTROL interactive process provides commands to add and delete
              external messages to the local problem list.

           o  SNS$SHR shareable image contains the routines SNS$ADD_MESSAGE and
              SNS$DELETE_MESSAGE, which add and delete messages to the local prob-
              lem lists.
