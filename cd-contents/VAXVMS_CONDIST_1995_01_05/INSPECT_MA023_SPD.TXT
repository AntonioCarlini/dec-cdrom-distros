PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER Security Compliance Manager  SPD 26.N1.04
               for OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS AXP, Version
               2.3A

DESCRIPTION

In previous versions of POLYCENTER[TM] Security products, the name DECin-
spect[TM] was used instead of POLYCENTER Security.

This Software Product Description describes POLYCENTER[TM] Security
Compliance Manager for both OpenVMS[TM] VAX[TM] and OpenVMS AXP[TM]
systems.

POLYCENTER Security Compliance Manager for OpenVMS is a software tool
that a security or system manager uses to establish a custom security
analysis and reporting system to manage the security of a network of
distributed systems. With this tool, the security manager can imple-
ment and maintain a security standard consistent with corporate se-
curity policy for the OpenVMS nodes in the distributed computing en-
vironment.

Customers can purchase security consulting services for assistance in
designing and implementing a security analysis and reporting system
that balances business needs with security requirements. Local Dig-
ital[TM] offices can assist customers in determining the appropriate
services for their requirements.

POLYCENTER Security Compliance Manager for OpenVMS software runs on
every OpenVMS node in a network to periodically evaluate compliance
with a security policy defined by the security manager. Optionally,
POLYCENTER Security Compliance Manager for OpenVMS software also:


                              DIGITAL                     July 1994

                                                        AE-PGBZE-TE

 

o  Reports to POLYCENTER Security Reporting Facility for OpenVMS soft-
   ware (SPD 26.N2.xx). POLYCENTER Security Reporting Facility for Open-
   VMS software runs on one or more nodes and supports centralized col-
   lection and management of compliance reports from POLYCENTER Se-
   curity Compliance Manager for OpenVMS installations.

o  Examines settings of and supports use of POLYCENTER Security In-
   trusion Detector for OpenVMS software (SPD 41.27.xx). POLYCENTER
   Security Intrusion Detector for OpenVMS software monitors OpenVMS
   Audit Server events in real-time and sends alarms of specified events
   to the security manager. POLYCENTER Security Intrusion Detector for
   OpenVMS can also take automatic countermeasures against users and
   nodes defined to be intruders.

POLYCENTER Security Compliance Manager for OpenVMS software establishes
processes called inspectors. An inspector periodically evaluates (in-
spects) nodes for compliance with the security-relevant parameter set-
tings in the inspector's policy file. Using POLYCENTER Security Com-
pliance Manager for OpenVMS software, the security manager defines set-
tings for the parameters in policy files.

A security manager can choose standard parameters and tests and op-
tionally create customized file, directory, and account parameters and
customized tests. For OpenVMS systems, inspectors can evaluate the security-
relevant parameters belonging to the following system components:

o  Files and directories

o  Accounts

o  Network settings and accounts

o  SYSGEN parameters

o  Security auditing

o  POLYCENTER Security Intrusion Detector for OpenVMS settings

o  Any others defined by the security manager

                                 2

 

Each POLYCENTER Security Compliance Manager for OpenVMS installation
has a Required Inspector and the option to create customized inspec-
tors. The security manager sets the parameters of the Required Inspec-
tor policy file and establishes an inspection schedule to comply with
a corporate baseline security standard. The security manager can es-
tablish other customized inspectors to evaluate any set of parameters,
on any required schedule.

After each inspection is completed, the inspector generates a detailed
report indicating the success or failure of each test performed. The
report describes results for all nodes tested by the inspector. By de-
fault, the report is mailed to the system account or the user who ini-
tiated the inspector. The detailed reports can also be sent to any elec-
tronic mail address specified on the inspector's distribution list by
the security manager.

For each node, POLYCENTER Security Compliance Manager for OpenVMS soft-
ware generates a DCL command procedure, known as a lockdown file, that
can be run to adjust parameters automatically to comply with the pol-
icy file used by the inspector that created the lockdown.

NOTE: Lockdown command procedures should never be run without assess-
ing the impact of parameter changes to system operations. Each com-
mand in a lockdown command procedure should be examined to make sure
the suggested solution is compatible with the particular environment.

The Required Inspector optionally generates security status messages
called tokens. Tokens contain a summary of the inspection of the com-
plete set of security-relevant parameters in the Required Inspector's
policy file. POLYCENTER Security Compliance Manager for OpenVMS soft-
ware sends the tokens to a central collection point - a node running
the POLYCENTER Security Reporting Facility for OpenVMS security re-
porting software.

While POLYCENTER Security Compliance Manager for OpenVMS can be used
alone in small distributed systems, managing a large number of nodes




                                 3

 

or a set of nodes on a dispersed network can be difficult. POLYCEN-
TER Security Reporting Facility for OpenVMS software supports central-
ized management for distributed POLYCENTER Security Compliance Man-
ager for OpenVMS client nodes. POLYCENTER Security Reporting Facil-
ity for OpenVMS software extracts data from tokens and maintains this
compliance data in a relational database for management reporting. For
more information about managing network security, see the POLYCENTER
Security Reporting Facility for OpenVMS Software Product Description
(SPD 26.N2.xx).
