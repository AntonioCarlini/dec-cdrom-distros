 PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER HSM for OpenVMS, Version 1.0 SPD 46.38.00

 DESCRIPTION

 POLYCENTER HSM for OpenVMS is a layered software product that extends
 the OpenVMS file system allowing efficient management of infrequently
 accessed (dormant) data. HSM automatically executes the migration of
 dormant data from online (primary) storage to less expensive, lower
 performing nearline or offline (shelf) storage and back again when the
 data is accessed. The movement of active data to shelf storage is called
 shelving.

 New and frequently accessed files remain online while older and less
 active files are automatically or manually moved in accordance with
 user-defined policies. The movement of files between the online, near-
 line, and offline areas is transparent to users and applications. The
 directory information (file headers) for shelved data is maintained
 in directories on primary storage devices. The data itself is on the
 shelf device. When direct access is needed to the shelved data, HSM
 automatically returns it to primary storage. The file attributes may
 be viewed and modified without bringing the data back online.

 Control of the movement of files between storage areas is accomplished
 by:

 o  Specifying which files are or are not moved

 o  Setting a high water mark on the primary storage to automatically
    trigger shelving of dormant data

 o  Setting a low water mark as a space recovered goal when your files
    are moved

                               DIGITAL                  October 1994

                                                         AE-PWNTA-TE

 

 The management of HSM is set through HSM policies. HSM policies use
 predefined selection algorithms or scripts containing HSM-specific com-
 mands to shelve or unshelve files, in response to trigger events. Trig-
 ger events are situations that occur from time to time and that, when
 set by an HSM policy, cause HSM to move files to shelf storage. Ex-
 amples of specific trigger events are listed below:

 o  Volume occupancy full

 o  Disk quota exceeded

 o  High water mark reached

 o  Scheduled policy execution

 Trigger events, used in conjunction with an appropriately designed se-
 lection criteria, create enough online disk space to satisfy the pol-
 icy goal.

 The selection criteria include definitions that determine the best file
 to be shelved in response to the need for shelving. Examples of se-
 lection criteria include:

 o  Least recently used and size combination

 o  Least recently used

 o  According to a user-defined script

 Control over the start of the shelving process is either explicit or
 implicit. Explicit shelving is a process that has been started in re-
 sponse to a DCL command. The command can be issued directly to the Open-
 VMS Operating System or executed in an OpenVMS command procedure. Im-
 plicit shelving is a process that has been started by HSM in response
 to a trigger event or policy.

 Features

 To meet your storage management requirements, POLYCENTER HSM for Open-
 VMS:

 o  Operates as an integrated part of OpenVMS V6.1 or later.

                                  2

 

 o  Operates within the OpenVMS cluster and standalone environments.

 o  Maintains accessibility and reliability of files in both shelf stor-
    age and in primary storage.

 o  Provides 'preshelving' capabilities which allow the system to rapidly
    respond to requests for free space on a disk for unshelve opera-
    tions.

 o  Supports both automatic and manual data movement between primary
    and shelf storage.

 o  Provides a means to temporarily keep data in online storage (caching)
    to decrease the impact of shelving on other operations. The cache
    can then be flushed at a later time with smaller performance im-
    pact on the system.

 o  Maintains access to file data within a suitable and definable time-
    frame.

 o  Minimizes the frequency of volume occupancy full and disk quota ex-
    ceeded conditions.

 o  Provides full audit error logging of all shelving activities.

 o  Manages HSM devices across an OpenVMS cluster and optimizes requests
    across the cluster.

 o  Recovers pending operations after system failure.

 HSM for OpenVMS is licensed and priced on the basis of GB of nearline
 storage being managed by the software. An HSM base license, which in-
 cludes the unlimited use (can run on all nodes) in a cluster and 10
 GB of nearline storage capacity is required. Concurrent Use licenses
 must be purchased for additional capacity (GB of nearline storage) to
 be managed by HSM above 10 GB. Varying increments of capacity are of-
 fered to meet the needs of a wide range (size) of computing environ-
 ments.

 HSM for OpenVMS Version 1.0 will operate in a mixed OpenVMS environ-
 ment.
