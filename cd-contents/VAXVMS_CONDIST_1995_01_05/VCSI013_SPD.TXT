 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC VOICE:mail for OpenVMS VAX,         SPD 38.62.01
                Version 1.3A

 DESCRIPTION

 DEC VOICE:mail[TM] is a full functional voice messaging system that
 provides powerful features for sending, receiving, saving and manag-
 ing voice information over the phone. Voice information management fea-
 tures include user defined folders for message management, selective
 review of messages, and user controlled filters to control paging and
 message notification. DEC VOICE:mail is an OpenVMS layered applica-
 tion.

 DEC VOICE:mail includes a message management environment for storage,
 processing and management of the user's voice messages and stored voice
 phrases.

 DEC VOICE:mail connects to the telephone system via Digital's DECvoice
 T1 hardware and software for audio messaging. DEC VOICE:mail also links
 to the telephone system providing incoming call ID which can be used
 for direct connection to personal greetings. Message waiting indica-
 tion is also provided.

 DEC VOICE:mail software provides users with personal voice Mailboxes
 for these and other important communication functions:

 o  24-hour telephone answering in the user's voice, providing a va-
    riety of personal greetings.

 o  Easy transmission of messages and other voice information between
    users, including the creation of Distribution Lists for group mes-
    sages.

 o  Worldwide access to messages from any DTMF (Dual Tone Multi Fre-
    quency) telephone, including office, home, hotel, car or airplane.

                                                         AE-PZQLB-TE

 

 o  User-defined folders that allow the categorizing and saving of mes-
    sages for future use and reference.

 o  A selective review feature that lets users choose the type of mes-
    sages they want to hear, such as messages from a specific caller,
    or messages saved in a particular Folder.

 o  Message notification to any other telephone, including cellular phones
    and pagers. DEC VOICE:mail has the ability to call the user at any
    designated telephone number or pager for notification that a new
    message has been received.

 o  Message editing, which allows the user to review and modify a mes-
    sage before sending it out. The user can add on to the message or
    erase and re-record the message.

 o  Call management, which allows the user to control DEC VOICE:mail
    call transfers. The call management features includes: Call screen-
    ing, Call blocking and Forwarding of calls to another number.

 The message management environment in DEC VOICE:mail allows for ef-
 fective storage and distribution of voice messages. Messages are stored
 with envelopes which contain message addressing information that points
 to a single stored message segment. Messages sent to several Mailboxes
 are recorded and stored only once, conserving disk space. DEC VOICE:mail
 includes Phrase Library storage management of pre-recorded phrases,
 and a phrase recording system which allows for creation of recorded
 phrases using a telephone.

 DEC VOICE:mail includes phone book services, which allow dial-by-name
 requests using DEC VOICE:mail's directory.

 DEC VOICE:mail Mailboxes can be controlled, managed and customized in
 their access to the capabilities of the messaging system. Each Mail-
 box is assigned a Class of Service (COS) which control access to func-
 tions like:

 o  Maximum Message Length, Retention Time, Number of messages

 o  Allow/Disallow Message Editing

 o  Message forwarding to Local extensions, Toll Calls or Long Distance

                                  2

 

 o  Allow/Disallow Message Notification to a Pager

 o  Transfer to Extension or Operator

 o  Access to Distribution Lists

 o  Number of Greetings Allowed

 o  Allow/Disallow Tagging messages Urgent, Private

 DEC VOICE:mail includes System Management and Administration Utili-
 ties for effective management of the messaging system. The utilities
 are provided with both menu driven and command line interfaces. These
 Utilities include:

 o  Mailbox Utility to create, modify and delete individual or groups
    of Mailboxes.

 o  Class of Service Utility to modify any or all categories within a
    Class of Service.

 o  Mailbox and Line Usage Statistics DEC VOICE:mail provides statis-
    tics collection and management reporting on individual or groups
    of Mailboxes. Telephone line statistics can be collected and re-
    ported to analyze telephone port usage. Statistics data can be fed
    to external applications, e.g., billing applications.

 o  Diagnostic Utilities for real-time monitoring of telephone ports
    and the information transfer between the PBX and DEC VOICE:mail.

 DEC VOICE:mail allows for information transfer between DEC VOICE:mail
 and most popular PBX models. This integration communicates the fol-
 lowing information to and from the PBX:

 o  The PBX identifies the called party so that DEC VOICE:mail can au-
    tomatically access the correct Mailbox after a busy signal or ring
    /no answer.

 o  When a new message has been delivered to a Mailbox, DEC VOICE:mail
    signals the PBX to activate Message Waiting Indication (MWI), ei-
    ther a light on the telephone or a special "stutter" dial tone.

 Up to 31 PBXs can be supported from one DEC VOICE:mail system.

                                  3

 

 DEC VOICE:mail supports the following telephone integration methods:

 o  SMDI (Simplified Message Desk Interface)
    The SMDI protocol uses a RS232 data link for communications.

 o  In-Band DTMF (Dual Tone Multi Frequency)
    In-Band DTMF uses DTMF tones on the talk-path for communications
    between the PBX and DEC VOICE:mail.
    In-Band DTMF integration can be received by DEC VOICE:mail imme-
    diately after the phone call has been established, or through E&M
    signalling protocol before establishing the phone call.

 For certain PBXs that do not support SMDI or In-Band DTMF, signaling
 integration can be achieved via a SID (Software Integration Device).
 A SID is a protocol converter connected to the PBX on a separate sta-
 tion line not connected to DEC VOICE:mail's talk path. The SID is con-
 nected to the DEC VOICE:mail system via a RS232 data link, analogous
 to the SMDI signaling method.

 DOCUMENTATION

 DEC VOICE:mail includes documentation targeted for the following au-
 diences:

 o  System Manager

 o  System Administrator

 o  Telephone Attendant/Message Desk Attendant

 o  End User - Mailbox Subscriber

 o  Pocket and wallet size guides for end users

 The documentation kit for DEC VOICE:mail includes 100 copies each of
 the pocket and wallet size guides and one copy each of the remaining
 manuals. A separate End User Guide Kit is available with 100 copies
 each of the pocket and wallet size guides.

 Other Hardware Required:

 DECvoice T1 Hardware options:

 The DTCN5 option is used to connect the DECvoice system to a maximum
 of three digital DS1 telephone circuits. It consists of a quad Q-bus
 module and a bulkhead adapter assembly used for telephone network con-
 nection and a voice interconnect bus connection.

 The DTC05 option is a quad Q-bus module that provides voice genera-
 tion and recognition capability. One module required per eight ports.

 Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1)

 Disk space required for    75,000 blocks
 installation:
                            (37 MB)

 Disk space required for    45,000 blocks
 use (permanent):
                            (22 MB)

 These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
 sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
 system environment, configuration, and software options.






                                  7

 

 The main purpose of DEC VOICE:mail is to store and manage Voice Mes-
 sages. Storage of Voice Messages requires significant disk space. As
 general guideline in planning disk space requirements the following
 information can be used:

    1 Minute of Voice storage requires 240 KB of disk space when the
    default recording algorithm (32 Kbps ADPCM) is used.

 Memory Requirements

 The minimum memory size required for most typical hardware configu-
 rations is at least 24 MB plus 1 MB per telephone port connected to
 the system.

 Processor Restrictions:

 DECvoice T1 hardware modules are not distributed, nor shareable, across
 nodes in the VAXcluster. The DECvoice T1 modules must reside locally,
 that is, on the processor where DEC VOICE:mail is installed. For more
 information on DECvoice, refer to the DECvoice Software Product De-
 scription (SPD 29.97.xx).

 Based on typical application performance, the following table lists
 the maximum supported number of physical telephone lines for each sys-
 tem processor type. This is based on 90% concurrent line utilization.

 OPTIONAL HARDWARE

 DEC VOICE:mail initiates call transfers using switch/hook signaling.
 This requires that the DEC VOICE:mail system is connected via DECvoice
 T1 to a T1 trunk circuit with FXO/FXS channels. This often requires
 a Channel Bank to be connected between the telephone switch and the
 DEC VOICE:mail system.




                                  9

 

 If PBX signaling integration is required via the SMDI or SID methods
 one or more RS232 ports are required on the processor where DEC VOICE:mail
 is installed.

 DEC VOICE:mail is supported for SID integration using the VoiceBridge[R]
 Series II PBX Integration Unit.
