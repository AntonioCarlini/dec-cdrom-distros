 PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER Performance Advisor          SPD 36.03.03
                for OpenVMS, Version 2.1

 OVERVIEW OF THE PRODUCT FAMILY

 POLYCENTER Performance Solution is a family of OpenVMS and U*IX lay-
 ered products that reduces the time and effort required to manage and
 monitor system performance, as well as plan for future resource re-
 quirements. The POLYCENTER Performance Solution products can be used
 with standalone OpenVMS, MIPS[TM] ULTRIX, DEC OSF/1[R] AXP, and clus-
 tered systems.

 The POLYCENTER Performance Solution products (formerly known as DECper-
 formance Solution, or DECps) include:

 o  POLYCENTER Performance Data Collector for OpenVMS gathers and man-
    ages OpenVMS system data (SPD 36.02.xx).

 o  POLYCENTER Performance Solution for UNIX[R] is Digital Equipment
    Corporation's solution for performance data collection and display
    on heterogeneous UNIX systems (SPD 46.97.xx).

 o  POLYCENTER Performance Advisor for OpenVMS analyzes OpenVMS data
    through the application of expert system technology. It identifies
    specific performance problems, presents detailed supporting evi-
    dence, and makes recommendations to improve system performance (de-
    scribed in this SPD).

 o  POLYCENTER Capacity Planner predicts OpenVMS system performance lev-
    els for various workloads and configurations (SPD 36.04.xx).

 o  POLYCENTER Accounting Chargeback for OpenVMS VAX generates a re-
    port of charges based on OpenVMS system resource utilization and
    user specified resource pricing (SPD 36.60.xx).

 POLYCENTER Performance Advisor for OpenVMS

 Performance Knowledge Base and Rules Compiler

 The POLYCENTER Performance Advisor for OpenVMS contains a knowledge
 base of rules and thresholds that it uses to analyze OpenVMS system
 data collected by the POLYCENTER Performance Data Collector on VAX and
 AXP systems. These factory rules cover five categories: memory, CPU,
 I/O, cluster, and miscellaneous.

 The knowledge base can be modified and expanded by the user. To in-
 tegrate new rules, modify existing rules, or turn off rules, the user
 creates an auxiliary knowledge base. For system analysis, the user can
 load the auxiliary knowledge base to augment the factory rules.

 The POLYCENTER Performance Advisor produces an analysis report that
 aids the system manager in monitoring system activities and in mak-
 ing performance evaluations by quickly identifying performance prob-
 lems. Through its analysis, POLYCENTER Performance Advisor also iden-
 tifies potential bottlenecks and the specific device on which the bot-
 tleneck may occur.

 The POLYCENTER Performance Advisor reports are generated at the re-
 quest of the user and include the Analysis Report, Brief Analysis Re-
 port, Performance Evaluation Report, Tabular Report, Graphs, and Pie
 Charts. The POLYCENTER Performance Advisor reports can be generated
 from either daily or historical data. All reports can be accessed through
 a Motif[R] interface.

 RealTime Displays

 A DECwindows Motif interface provides customizable displays consist-
 ing of a set of instrument panels. The instrument panels can contain
 any combination of bar graphs, strip charts, or meters. A set of de-
 fault instrument panels are predefined for viewing OpenVMS system per-
 formance statistics. The user can define display panels, organizing
 the presentation of real-time data according to local needs.



                                  2

 

 A character cell interface provides performance monitoring of several
 activity levels: system, process, disk, user, and image. This inter-
 face also supports a number of ReGIS displays for viewing system-level
 activity.

 Both real-time displays have the ability to "play back" performance
 data stored in collection files. This allows interaction analysis of
 what events may have lead to a problem situation.

 Analysis Reports

 The POLYCENTER Performance Advisor Analysis Report provides conclu-
 sions and recommendations for improving system performance. The Anal-
 ysis Report also contains the conditions under which the identified
 problems occurred, along with supporting time-stamped evidence to sub-
 stantiate the conclusions. The Analysis Report is generated from daily
 data files and, therefore, is most useful for daily, hourly, and weekly
 system performance analysis.

 A Brief Analysis Report identifies the rules that fired during the anal-
 ysis period and provides a one-line synopsis of the problem.

 Graphs and Pie Charts

 The POLYCENTER Performance Advisor provides a facility to represent
 graphically the data collected in the Performance Solution database
 by the Performance Data Collector. The Performance Advisor provides
 the system manager with a visual representation of the system's per-
 formance metrics. This robust source of information can provide a bet-
 ter understanding of resource utilization and overall workload demands.

 A wide range of predefined graphs and pie charts are provided along
 with the ability to define custom graphs. Graphs can be created in var-
 ious output formats, including DECwindows, ReGIS, ANSI, PostScript[R],
 CSV (comma-separated variables), and tabular output. Pie charts can
 be created in DECwindows and PostScript, CSV (comma-separated vari-
 ables), and tabular output.



                                  3

 

 System data for selected periods of time can be graphed using either
 daily or history data, an effective way to study the long term per-
 formance trends of standalone and clustered systems.

 Callable Interface

 The POLYCENTER Performance Advisor provides data extraction procedures
 that can be called from user-written programs. This facility allows
 system and application programmers to call library procedures for ex-
 traction of daily or real-time data. It also provides record defini-
 tions for the following languages: DEC Ada for OpenVMS VAX Systems,
 DEC Ada for OpenVMS AXP Systems, DEC BASIC, VAX BASIC, VAX BLISS-32,
 BLISS-32EN, VAX C, DEC C for OpenVMS AXP, DEC FORTRAN for OpenVMS, VAX LISP,
 MACRO, Pascal for OpenVMS, VAX PL/I and DEC PL/I for OpenVMS AXP.

 Export Facility

 This facility, available from DCL, simplifies the conversion of Data
 Collector daily and history data to binary or ASCII flat files. The
 binary file must be used with DATATRIEVE for any subsequent analysis.
 The ASCII data file can be produced in either CSV (comma-separated vari-
 ables) or DATATRIEVE format.

 Performance Evaluation and Tabular Reports

 The Performance Evaluation and Tabular Reports provide system and pro-
 cess statistics to assist the system manager in gauging the impact of
 changes made to the system. They are particularly useful in compar-
 ing system performance after implementation of a Performance Advisor
 recommendation. These reports provide summaries of disk and tape ac-
 tivity, CPU and memory utilization, as well as detailed statistics on
 all process activity. Performance Evaluation and Tabular Reports are
 generated from either daily or history data. Specifically, these re-
 ports provide summary information on:

 o  Process statistics in customizable formats

 o  Locking traffic

 o  Paging

 o  File activity and caching

                                  4

 

 o  Tables of SCS data

 o  Disk utilization

 o  Tape activity

 o  CPU and memory usage

 o  Pool resources by node

 o  Hot file activity

 o  System level statistics

 o  Terminal response time

    lems, and obtain recommendations for improved performance
