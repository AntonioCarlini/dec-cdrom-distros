 PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER Network Topology Option, Version 1.3  SPD
 39.71.01                (formerly DECmcc Configuration Package)

 INTRODUCTION

 POLYCENTER Network Topology Option is one of several separately avail-
 able packages of POLYCENTER Network Management Modules. These prod-
 ucts provide management functions and protocol support for different
 network and system management environments. POLYCENTER Network Man-
 agement Module Packages can be installed and used separately or in any
 combination with the POLYCENTER Framework. The management services pro-
 vided by newly installed modules are automatically enrolled in the POLY-
 CENTER Framework and are available to management services already in-
 stalled.

 POLYCENTER Framework software is the minimum prerequisite software prod-
 uct for POLYCENTER Network Management Module Packages such as the POLYCENTER
 Network Topology Option. Please refer to the POLYCENTER Network Man-
 agement Services Software Product Description (SPD 37.20.xx) for a list
 of the POLYCENTER Network Management products and module packages, and
 for a description of their relationship to each other and to the Dig-
 ital Enterprise Management Architecture (EMA).

 DESCRIPTION

 The POLYCENTER Network Topology Option offers the ability to automat-
 ically discover, register, and map managed objects by class. Supported
 classes include DECnet Phase IV nodes, TCP/IP hosts, and Digital LAN
 Bridges with FDDI devices. Users can define domains for each class and
 set network boundaries. The software queries DECnet routers, sequen-
 tially examines a set of addresses, and queries IP gateways and Bridge
 spanning trees for instance data such as network names and addresses.
 As devices are located and data is gathered, the POLYCENTER Network

 Topology Option automatically maps them in appropriate class domains
 and registers them.

 NOTE: This package requires that the appropriate Access Modules (AMs)
 be installed to discover and register the following device types: DEC-
 net Phase IV nodes, TCP/IP hosts, and Digital LAN Bridges with FDDI
 devices. The DECnet and TCP/IP SNMP AMs are included with the POLY-
 CENTER Framework, POLYCENTER Network Manager 200, and POLYCENTER Net-
 work Manager 400. POLYCENTER Framework, and POLYCENTER Network Man-
 ager 200 users must purchase the POLYCENTER Extended LAN Management
 (ELM) AM package separately to perform auto-configuration and auto-
 topology functions for Digital LAN Bridge and FDDI devices. POLYCEN-
 TER Network Manager 400 includes all the modules required for these
 functions.
