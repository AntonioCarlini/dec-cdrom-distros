 PRODUCT NAME:  VAX BASIC, Version 3.6                  SPD 25.36.23

 DESCRIPTION

 VAX BASIC  is  an  interactive,  shareable language processor for the
 OpenVMS Operating System.   VAX BASIC takes full advantage of the VAX
 floating point, decimal and character instructions.

 VAX BASIC provides a high-performance program development environment
 for  both  applications  development and  timesharing  by  generating
 inline OpenVMS VAX native mode instructions.    It combines the power
 of a structured programming language with the  interactivity  of  the
 BASIC   environment  and  the  convenience  of  easy-to-use  graphics
 statements.    VAX BASIC is also integrated with various  programming
 productivity   tools  and  key  components  of  the  VAX  Information
 Architecture.

 In addition to elementary BASIC features, VAX BASIC provides:

 o  Support for the following Programming Productivity Tools:

    -  OpenVMS Symbolic Debugger

    -  DEC Performance and Coverage Analyzer

    -  Support  for  the  DEC  Language-Sensitive  Editor/Source  Code
       Analyzer    (LSE/SCA)  to  provide  error  diagnostics  to  the
       Language-Sensitive  Editor  (LSE)  component,  cross  reference
       information for the Source  Code  Analyzer (SCA) component, and
       support for low level program  design, including the processing
       of  pseudocode and the extraction of  design  information  from
       comments.

 o  Access to the VAX Information Architecture

    -  RECORD structure for user-defined data types (similar to PASCAL
       record types).

    -  RECORD structure retrieval from the Common Data Dictionary.
