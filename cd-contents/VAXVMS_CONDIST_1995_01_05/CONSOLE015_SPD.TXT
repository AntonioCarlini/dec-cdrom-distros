PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER Console Manager, Version 1.1 SPD 42.90.01
               POLYCENTER Console Manager, OpenVMS VAX,
               Version 1.5

VERSION NUMBERING SCHEME

You will note that the OpenVMS VAX version of PCM is Version 1.5 while
version numbers on the other platforms (OpenVMS AXP, Ultrix RISC and
DEC OSF/1) are at Version 1.1. This is due to the fact that PCM Ver-
sion 1.5 replaces VAXcluster Console System (VCS) Version 1.4 and, as
such, must have a higher version number.
To prevent continued confusion over version numbers, Digital will bring
the revision number to V1.5 for PCM on each of the other platforms with
the next release of the platform CONDIST. By late August, PCM V1.5 will
be the shipping version on all platforms.

Printed documentation refers to PCM Version 1.1 when describing all
platforms. The change in version number occurred after the documen-
tation was submitted for printing. Version 1.1 and Version 1.5 are func-
tionally the same, and so the V1.1 Installation and User Guide doc-
umentation is applicable for both versions.

DESCRIPTION

POLYCENTER Console Manager (PCM) is a layered software product which
enables a host system to manage, monitor and control client console
devices. PCM can support up to 200 systems/devices of any platform type
that sends ASCII data over RS232C direct, TELNET or LAT connections
which support XON /XOFF, and I/O buffering. PCM also supports using
a pseudo-terminal interface. This provides a "soft" console for use
with user-defined application programs.

INSTALLATION

PCM software can be installed on any Digital workstation system or server
system as identified in this SPD. The devices serviced by PCM are con-
nected to the PCM host platform via:

o  Direct connection to the PCM host platform using a port of a se-
   rial line interface device (DHT)

o  Host-initiated LAT connection to a terminal server which is acces-
   sible to the PCM host system

o  Host-initiated TELNET connection to a terminal server which is ac-
   cessible to the PCM host system

o  A PCM host application program which takes its input from a pseudo-
   terminal port assigned to PCM

SOFTWARE COMPONENTS

PCM consists of the following components:

o  Console Controller Processes - Manages groups of console lines. The
   processes log to disk data received on those lines, searching for
   the occurrence of user-defined text strings which form PCM events.
   Matches are dispatched to the event notification services process.
   The console controller processes also control the user connect and
   monitor functions.

o  Central Control Coordinator (C3) Interface - An X-Windows OSF/Motif[R]
   interface that provides a logical view of the controlled systems.
   From this interface, system managers can monitor all console ac-
   tivities and respond to events detected on the console. Console events
   are reflected by the node icons in the display and direct the sys-
   tem manager to systems needing attention. Other interactive inter-
   faces can also be activated from the central control coordinator
   Interface.

   Note: Only Color Graphic display terminals are supported.

o  Full functionality with command line interface.

o  Monitor Interface - Enables system managers to monitor the serviced
   systems. It monitors these systems by displaying multiple windows
   of information. System managers can connect the primary window to
   a single system or display log data in this window while monitor-
   ing other nodes. This interface is equivalent to a subset of the
   C3 interface functionality, but is provided on a character cell ter-
   minal device.

o  Connect Interface - Enables system managers to connect to a man-
   aged system, making their terminal the dedicated console. Once con-
   nected, all keystrokes, except for the control keys defined to pro-
   vide the PCM exit, escape and break characters, are transmitted di-
   rectly to the console line of the node to which PCM is connected.
   While connected to serviced system, the system manager sees nor-
   mal console behavior. The only exceptions to normal behavior are
   the configurable control characters reserved to enable the oper-
   ator to escape back to the PCM monitor, exit to the operating sys-
   tem shell or CLI, and send a break character to the managed sys-
   tem. This interface is equivalent to a subset of the C3 interface
   functionality, but is provided on a character cell terminal device.

   Note: More than one system manager can connect to the same serviced
   system. However, connections made after the first are placed into
   "Read-Only" mode because it is unable to execute commands on that
   console.

o  Event Notification Services (ENS) - A suite of applications for in-
   terfacing with a wide range of communications media for PCM event
   notification. Event notification services provide a highly flex-
   ible mechanism for notifying system managers and other operations
   personnel of events occurring on the serviced systems. The events
   reported and the notification mechanism are highly customizable to
   fit the individual requirements of the system management domain.

o  Callable Interface - An API which allows users to interface their
   own programs to the event notification services. Only programs writ-
   ten in C are supported.

o  Configuration Editor - Allows operations staff to create and main-
   tain the configuration information.

POLYCENTER Console Manager, OpenVMS VAX, Version 1.5

o  Configuration Database - Contains information about the users and
   hosts being serviced by PCM.

o  Log Files - PCM maintains console, event and time stamp log files
   as the permanent historical records of console data from the ser-
   viced systems. These files may be spread over multiple disks for
   performance improvements.

Features

o  Supports up to 200 console connections to any systems or devices
   that transmits ASCII data over a RS232 line which supports XON/XOFF
   and I/O buffering. The maximum supported console terminal speed is
   19.2K baud.

o  All data received by PCM from connected systems or devices is logged
   to a disk file for the respective system or device, and is time stamped
   by PCM.

o  Operators can connect to the console port of any system serviced
   by PCM from any terminal connected to the PCM host.

o  PCM can control remote systems or devices in a LAN via LAT host-
   initiated connections over Ethernet using LAT terminal servers.

o  PCM can control remote systems or devices in a WAN via TELNET con-
   nections over an internet, using terminal servers which support TEL-
   NET connections.

o  Security is provided to allow the PCM Administrator to restrict user
   access.

o  PCM detects events by scanning console text messages and compar-
   ing them with predefined literal strings or expressions contained
   in the configuration database.

o  This graphical display uses color to indicate the severity of an
   event. It also allows the user to easily access a console by click-
   ing with a mouse to activate a PCM interface.

MANAGED SYSTEM RESTRICTIONS

The PCM software cannot currently support a DECstation system as a man-
aged system. This is due to a feature of the RISC ULTRIX X-Server which
can not support the console device being directed to a physical tty
port on the system rather than the graphics device.

Remote system halt requires hardware and/or operating system support
to transmit a signal.

Memory Requirements for PCM Support:

PCM performance is highly dependent upon the amount of physical mem-
ory present. A minimum of 32 MB memory is required. This requirement
will increase with the number of serviced systems and the number of
concurrent X-Windows run from the PCM software.
