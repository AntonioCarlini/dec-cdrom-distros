 PRODUCT NAME:  DECmcc Terminal Server Access Module for OpenVMS, SPD
 43.99.00                Version 1.0

 DESCRIPTION

 The DECmcc Terminal Server Access Module (AM) is a VMS layered prod-
 uct that provides remote management access to Digital terminal servers
 within the DECmcc environment. The DECmcc Terminal Server AM allows
 DECmcc users to remotely configure and monitor Digital terminal servers
 anywhere in the extended Local Area Network (LAN) from a system run-
 ning DECmcc.

 DECmcc Terminal Server AM is installed and runs on the VMS platform,
 DECmcc configurations for the DECmcc Director V1.2, and the DECmcc Ba-
 sic Management System (BMS) V1.2. It is also a component for the DECmcc
 Enterprise Management System (EMS) V2.2 package.

 DECmcc Terminal Server AM V1.0 is the release of software that pro-
 vides migration of the Terminal Server Manager (TSM) capabilities to
 the DECmcc environment.

 The general characteristics of DECmcc Terminal Server AM include:

 o  Remote management capabilities for Digital Terminal Servers

 o  Allows for observation, monitoring, and controlling of Digital Ter-
    minal Servers on Local Area Networks

 o  Ability to display and modify devices, links, physical ports, op-
    erational and permanent, LAT/Telnet database characteristics

 o  Customize site specific alarms for the devices stored in the MIR
    (Management Information Respository) for faults, errors, and changed
    information

 o  Simultaneous management access by multiple users

 o  On-line Help facility

 o  Similar display formats for all manageable terminal servers

 Management Information Repository (MIR)

 DECmcc Terminal Server (TSAM) AM provides a Management Information Repos-
 itory (MIR) that contains the name, Ethernet address, terminal server
 type, and other fields for each server to be managed. Through the TSAM
 MIR, the user needs to refer only to the name of the server in order
 to gain access.

 DECnet Database Modification

 DECmcc Terminal Server AM can automatically update the DECnet manage-
 ment directory. Users do not need to separately use a DECnet AM to up-
 date DECnet information. The Terminal Server AM will access the DEC-
 net database itself to do the appropriate modifications.

 Fault Management

 Troubleshooting within the terminal server network is enhanced by TSAM
 providing the ability, centrally, to read traffic status and counters
 in addition to error status and counters. With the ``PASTHRU'' util-
 ity, the user can also connect directly to the server, allowing iso-
 lation of problems between DECmcc Terminal Server AM and the server.

 DECmcc Terminal Server AM V1.0 supports terminal servers running the
 following software:

 o  DECserver 100 for VMS V1.2 - V2.0

 o  DECserver 200 for VMS V1.0 - V3.1

 o  DECserver 250 for VMS V1.0 - V2.0

 o  DECserver 300 for VMS V1.0 - V2.1

 o  DECserver 500 for VMS V1.2 - V2.1

 o  DECserver 700 for VMS V1.0

 o  DECserver 90TL V1.0

                                  2

 

 o  DECserver 90L V1.0
