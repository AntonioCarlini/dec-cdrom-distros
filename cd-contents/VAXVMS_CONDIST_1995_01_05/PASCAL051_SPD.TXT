 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC Pascal for OpenVMS                  SPD 25.11.38

 This SPD describes two products:

 o  DEC Pascal Version 5.2 for OpenVMS AXP Systems

 o  DEC Pascal Version 5.1 for OpenVMS VAX Systems

 DESCRIPTION

 DEC Pascal is an implementation of the Pascal[*] language that accepts
 programs compatible with either level of the ISO specification for Pro-
 gramming languages - Pascal [ISO 7185-1987] as well as ANSI/IEEE 770X3.97-
 1987. DEC Pascal also meets the Federal Information Processing Stan-
 dard Publication (FIPS-109) requirements by accepting programs con-
 forming to the ANSI standard. DEC Pascal also accepts many features
 from the Extended Pascal standard (ANSI/IEEE 770X3.160-1989 and ISO
 10206).

 The compiler has been validated for both levels of the ISO unextended
 Pascal standard and for conforming to FIPS-109. Containing extensions
 to the standards, DEC Pascal generates optimized, shareable code that
 takes full advantage of the VAX and Alpha AXP hardware floating point
 and character instruction sets and the virtual memory capabilities of
 the OpenVMS VAX or OpenVMS AXP Operating Systems. The language con-
 tains control statements, data types, and predeclared procedures and
 functions.

 Major Pascal Language Elements:

 o  INTEGER, REAL, CHAR, BOOLEAN, enumerated, and subrange data types

 o  ARRAY, RECORD, SET, and FILE structured data types

 o  Schemata type denoting families of types

 o  STRING schema denoting variable-length character strings up to 65,535
    characters

 o  FOR, REPEAT, and WHILE repetitive control statements

 o  CASE, IF-THEN, and IF-THEN-ELSE conditional statements

 o  BEGIN...END compound statement

 o  User-defined procedures and functions that can return structured
    types (other than file types)

 o  GET, PUT, READ, WRITE, READLN, and WRITELN input and output pro-
    cedures

 o  Concatenation operator and set of predefined character string func-
    tions including INDEX, LENGTH, and SUBSTR

 o  DOUBLE (D_floating, G_floating, IEEE T_floating (OpenVMS AXP only))
    and QUADRUPLE (OpenVMS VAX only) data types that support the VAX
    and Alpha AXP extended range and extended precision floating point
    architectural features

    65,535 characters

 o  Concatenation operator and set of predefined character string func-
    tions including INDEX, LENGTH, and SUBSTR

    relative files, and sequential and keyed access to VAX RMS multi-
    key indexed files

 o  Optional attributes specification on constants, variables, types,
    type identifiers, routines, routine parameters, schema discrimi-
    nants, and compilation units

 o  MODULE capability for combining procedures, functions, and other
    declarations for compilation separate from the main program

 o  ENVIRONMENT and INHERIT attributes to control separate and inde-
    pendent compilation

 o  UNSIGNED, CARDINAL, INTEGER_ADDRESS, INTEGERnn, UNSIGNEDnn, POINTER,
    and SINGLE predefined types

 o  VALUE initialization section and optional value initialization in
    declaration section program level

 o  External procedure and function declarations

 o  Nonpositional passing of parameters

 o  RETURN, BREAK, CONTINUE, EXIT, and NEXT statements

 o  Default values for parameters

 o  Double-quoted character strings with backslash constants

 o  31-character identifiers that can include dollar sign ($) and un-
    derscore (_)

                                  3

 

 As a native-mode language, DEC Pascal is integrated into the Common
 Language Environment. This integration provides DEC Pascal users with:

 o  Support for OpenVMS interlanguage calling standard

 o  Access to all OpenVMS system services

 o  Access to the facilities of the OpenVMS Symbolic Debugger

 o  Callable interfaces to the OpenVMS Common Run-time Library

 o  CDD/Repository support

 o  Support for the Language-Sensitive Editor/Source Code Analyzer to
    provide error diagnostics to Language-Sensitive Editor component,
    cross reference information for Source Code Analyzer component, and
    support for low-level program design, including the processing of
    pseudocode. In addition, DEC Pascal for OpenVMS VAX Systems also
    supports the extraction of design information from comments.

 o  Ability for functions to return structured types (other than file
    types)

 Options available to Pascal users at compile time include:

 o  Run-time checks for array, character string, and subrange bounds

 o  Run-time checks for arithmetic overflow, valid case selector val-
    ues, and null pointer variables

 o  Run-time checks for invalid declarations and illegal GOTO usage

 o  Generation of information for use by the OpenVMS Symbolic Debug-
    ger and the run-time error traceback mechanism

 o  Creation of an environment file facilitating separate compilation

 o  Cross-reference listing

 o  Creating in the listing file a representation of the object code
    generated by the compiler

 o  Printing of information-level messages including flagging uses of
    extensions to the ISO and ANSI Pascal standards

                                  4
