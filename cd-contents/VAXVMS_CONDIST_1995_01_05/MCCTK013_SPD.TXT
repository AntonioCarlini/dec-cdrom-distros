 PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER Framework Developer's Toolkit, Version 1.3
 SPD 32.49.04                (Formerly DECmcc Developer's Toolkit)

 INTRODUCTION

 The POLYCENTER Framework Developer's Toolkit consists of software and
 documentation used in the development of POLYCENTER Network Manage-
 ment 200/400 Access Modules (AMs) and Function Modules (FMs). Avail-
 able in OpenVMS and RISC/ULTRIX versions, the product is intended for
 experienced system software developers.

 The POLYCENTER Framework Developer's Toolkit is one of several prod-
 ucts in the POLYCENTER Product Family, a group of related network and
 system management software products based on the Digital Enterprise
 Management Architecture (EMA). For an overview of these products, re-
 fer to the POLYCENTER Network Management Product Family Overview Soft-
 ware Product Description (SPD 37.20.xx).

 DESCRIPTION

 The POLYCENTER Framework Developer's Toolkit consists of software tools
 and documentation that enable users to design and develop Access or
 Function Modules for the following POLYCENTER Network Manager 200/400
 Family Products:

 o  POLYCENTER Framework (DECmcc Director) (SPD 32.46.xx)

 o  POLYCENTER Network Manager 200 (DECmcc Basic Management System) (DECmcc
    BMS, SPD 32.48.xx)

 o  POLYCENTER Network Manager 400 (DECmcc Enterprise Management Sta-
    tion) (DECmcc EMS, SPD 31.88.xx)

                               DIGITAL                    April 1993

                                                         AE-PC88E-TE

 

 Note: POLYCENTER Framework or POLYCENTER Network Manager 200 or POLY-
 CENTER Network Manager 400 software is required for installing, en-
 rolling, testing, and operating management modules developed using the
 POLYCENTER Framework Developer's Toolkit. The POLYCENTER Framework De-
 veloper's Toolkit software simplifies the design and implementation
 of application-specific modules by offering a runtime kernel execu-
 tive, various service programs, and source code for sample Access and
 Function Modules.

 Documentation

 The POLYCENTER Framework Developer's Toolkit documentation provides
 information to assist in the design and development of POLYCENTER Net-
 work Management Modules. It includes the following documents:

 o  Enterprise Management Architecture (EMA) General Description

 o  EMA Entity Model

 o  The DECmcc System Reference Manual (SRM Volume 1 & 2)

 o  POLYCENTER Management Module Programming

 o  The POLYCENTER Framework Developer's Toolkit Reference

 The POLYCENTER Module Reference Manuals, available on-line only, pro-
 vide specifications of the services offered and required by each POLY-
 CENTER/DECmcc network management module.

 Development Utilities

 Development utilities and tools that are part of the Toolkit include
 the Design Framework, a sample Access Module, and an example Function
 Module:

 o  POLYCENTER Network Management Design Framework is a set of generic
    software components that enable users to construct a starter Man-
    agement Module. Such a module can be used as a base for the devel-
    opment of application-specific Access or Function Modules. The De-
    sign Framework uses proven development techniques that minimize cod-

                                  2

 

    ing errors, expedite development, and reduce coding ambiguities that
    can arise during module design.

 o  Sample Access Module is a basic example of an AM that can be run
    on a POLYCENTER Network Manager 200/400 or POLYCENTER Framework sys-
    tem. It contains working examples of many of the POLYCENTER Net-
    work Manager 200/400 interfaces, including the mcc_call interface
    and calls to many of the POLYCENTER Network Manager 200/400 rou-
    tines that enable Management Modules to reside on and interoper-
    ate within a POLYCENTER Network Manager 200/400 system. The Sam-
    ple AM is implemented using the Design Framework. NOTE: The Sam-
    ple AM explicitly uses Phase IV of DECnet-VAX, or DECnet-ULTRIX.
    If DECnet is unavailable, the Sample AM may be run with the trans-
    port disabled for illustration purposes only.

 o  Example Function Module contains working examples of common rou-
    tines used by FMs to access the services of the POLYCENTER Network
    Manager system and other FMs and AMs. It is layered on top of the
    Sample AM.

 o  The following utilities are included in the POLYCENTER Framework
    and POLYCENTER Network Manager 200/400 Software and are necessary
    for enrolling application-specific access modules and related files
    into the POLYCENTER Network Management system:

 o  Management Specification Language (MSL) Translator Utility

 o  Dictionary Administrator Program (DAP) Utility

 o  Bed Driver (TBD) Utility

 o  Help File Builder (HFB) Utility

 These utilities allow on-site enrollment of access and function mod-
 ules. The POLYCENTER Framework Developer's Toolkit Reference (AA-PD5MC-
 TE) describes each utility in detail.
