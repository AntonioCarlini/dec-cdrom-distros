 PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER Extended LAN Manager,        SPD 31.33.03
                for OpenVMS VAX, Version 1.3

 OVERVIEW

 POLYCENTER Extended LAN Manager Option Packages are OpenVMS layered
 products that enable POLYCENTER Framework Family product users to con-
 figure, manage, monitor, and control LAN Bridge, DECbridge, and DEC-
 concentrator 500 devices in the "Extended LAN" and FDDI network en-
 vironment. The term LAN Bridge is used to refer to Digital Equipment
 Corporation's LAN Bridge 100, LAN Bridge 150, LAN Bridge 200, METROWAVE
 Bridge, and Chipcom(R)'s Ethermodem[TM] Broadband Bridge. The term DECbridge
 is used to refer to Digital Equipment Corporation's DECbridge 500 and
 600 Series products.

 The LAN Bridge and DECbridge products are the primary building blocks
 of the "Extended LAN" (Local Area Network) architecture. An Extended
 LAN is a collection of LANs that are interconnected and logically ap-
 pear as one large Local Area Network. The DECconcentrator family of
 products is the primary building block of the FDDI network environ-
 ment. Together these environments are physically and logically attached
 and extended via the DECbridge family of products. The DECbridge prod-
 uct line is the family of products which allow Ethernet and FDDI net-
 works to communicate transparently.

 The LAN Bridge and DECbridge products operate at the data link level,
 and FDDI DECconcentrators operate at the data link and physical link
 levels. Both product sets are transparent to upper level protocols.

 PACKAGE OPTIONS

 The POLYCENTER Extended LAN Manager package options can be added to
 selected POLYCENTER Framework Family products to provide management
 of LAN Bridges, DECbridges, and FDDI DECconcentrators. There are two
 POLYCENTER Extended LAN Manager license option packages.

 o  POLYCENTER Extended LAN Manager Access Module (AM)-provides man-
    agement protocol support for, and user access to, LAN Bridges, DECbridges,
    and FDDI DECconcentrators. This package, added to either the POLY-
    CENTER Framework or the POLYCENTER Network Manager 200 enables users
    to take full advantage of those products' integrated command set,
    graphic and command line user interfaces, and extensibility to reg-
    ister, monitor, and control devices supported by the AM. This AM
    license package also enables POLYCENTER users to customize alarm
    rules and generate performance statistics for the supported devices.

 o  POLYCENTER Extended LAN Manager Functional Module (FM)-can option-
    ally be added to a POLYCENTER Framework. Used in conjunction with
    the POLYCENTER Extended LAN Manager AM package, it provides POLY-
    CENTER Framework users with automatic device registration, FDDI ring
    map autotopology and LAN Bridge spanning tree autotopology support-
    ing IEEE 802.1d spanning tree and Digital's LAN Bridge 100 span-
    ning tree protocols.

 Note that the functions provided by the POLYCENTER Extended LAN Man-
 ager FM package are included as part of the POLYCENTER Network Man-
 ager 200. Both the POLYCENTER Extended LAN Manager AM and POLYCENTER
 Extended LAN Manager FM capabilities are included as part of the POLY-
 CENTER Network Manager 400 on OpenVMS VAX. To utilize the features of
 the POLYCENTER Extended LAN Manager FM package, the POLYCENTER Extended
 LAN Manager AM package is required. For more information about the POLY-
 CENTER products, refer to the SPDs listed later in this document.

 Depending on the user's POLYCENTER configuration, an additional soft-
 ware license may be required. Refer to the SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS sec-
 tion of the POLYCENTER Extended LAN Manager Software Product Descrip-
 tion or System Support Addendum (SSA 31.33.03-x) for more detail.

 GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS

 This release of POLYCENTER Extended LAN Manager is the release of soft-
 ware which supersedes the DECelms point product functionality for the
 POLYCENTER environment. The Extended LAN Manager AM and FM modules to-
 gether provide additional functionality to DECelms.

 The general characteristics of POLYCENTER Extended LAN Manager AM in-
 clude:

 o  Remote management capabilities for FDDI and Ethernet devices on the
    same extended LAN

 o  Allows for observation, monitoring, and controlling of intercon-
    nected FDDI and Ethernet networks

 o  Ability to display and modify devices and lines on the LAN Bridge
    and DECbridge family of products

 o  Ability to display and monitor physical ports on the DECbridge 500
    and 600 Series and DECconcentrator 500

 o  Ability to display spanning tree characteristics on the LAN Bridge
    and DECbridge family of products

 o  Ability to display and modify protocol database characteristics on
    LAN Bridge 200 and the DECbridge family of products

 o  Ability to display and modify forwarding database characteristics
    on the LAN Bridge and DECbridge family of products

 o  Ability to enable and disable lines on LAN Bridge and DECbridge prod-
    ucts

 o  Ability to enable and disable physical ports on the DECconcentra-
    tor 500

 o  Ability to customize site specific alarms for the devices stored
    in the MIR (management information repository) for faults, errors,
    and changed information

 o  Display of data-link counters, status, and characteristics on LAN
    bridges, DECbridges, and DECconcentrators

                                  3
