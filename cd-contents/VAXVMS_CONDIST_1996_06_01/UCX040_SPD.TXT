 PRODUCT NAME:   Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS V4.0        SPD
 46.46.02

 DESCRIPTION

 The Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS product is a layered software
 product that provides interoperability and resource sharing between
 OpenVMS systems, UNIX[R] systems, and other systems that support the
 TCP/IP Protocol Suite, and Sun[R] Microsystems' NFS[TM].

 The Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS (TCP/IP) product provides net-
 work file access, remote terminal access, remote command execution,
 remote printing, mail, and application development.

 A lower cost version of the Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS prod-
 uct, identified as a client, is available for users who do not require
 the full complement of features available in the Digital TCP/IP Ser-
 vices for OpenVMS product. The client license includes all of the func-
 tionality of the server license with the exception that the follow-
 ing server components are not included when the client license is pur-
 chased:NFS Server, BIND Server, PCNFS Server, and the remote BOOT Server.

 Customers requiring any of those server functions should purchase the
 server license. A Digital TCP/IP Client Upgrade license is also avail-
 able in case the full product is required after initial purchase of
 a clinet-only license.

 NEW FEATURES

 IP/Multicasting

 Allows users to participate in multicast messaging, including the use
 of the multicast backbone of the Internet. Saves bandwidth by limit-
 ing the number of messages which must be sent.

 Dynamic Load Balancing-DNS based

 Ensures the work load is evenly distributed across all hosts in a clus-
 ter, ensuring optimim response times for users.

 Rlogin PROXY

 Provides proxy access to systems so that a host_name;user_name com-
 bination can attach directly to a target system without going through
 user_name:password interaction when the connection is established.

 RCP-Remote Copy Procedure

 Allows users to remotely copy files from any system in a network to
 any other system in the network as though the files were local files.

 Outbound Telnet

 Allows system managers to permanently create TN device names connected
 to remote devices.

 VMS Integration

 Provides easier access to TCP/IP functions using OpenVMS DCL commands.








                                  2

 

 RPC/RPCGEN

 RPC enables customers to run procedures on remote systems using the
 lastest SUN(tm)RPC libraries. RPCGEN enables customers to automati-
 cally generate RPC calls.

 OpenVMS 64 bit support

 Provides users with the capability to run on 64 bit OpenVMS V7.0.

 Features

 Installation and Configuration

 The Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS V4.0 product is installed with
 VMSINSTALfor VAX computer systems, or with the POLYCENTER Software In-
 stallation (PCSI) utility for ALpha computer systems.

 For configuration ease, the Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS prod-
 uct provides a menu-driven configuration procedure. This procedure en-
 ables you to configure only those services and applications that you
 use. It also enables you to configure all client software components
 quickly without selecting individual menu options.

 Communications

 Communications are based on the 4.3 Berkeley Software Distribution,
 implementing the following protocols and features:

 o  Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

 o  Internet Protocol (IP)

 o  Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)

 o  Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

 o  User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

 o  Routing Information Protocol (RIP)

 o  Ethernet support

                                  3

 

 o  FDDI support

 o  Auxiliary (AUX) Server (inetd), plus enhancements such as security
    and event logging

 Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) Support

 FDDI is an ANSI standard for a network technology based on fiber op-
 tics. It specifies a 100-megabit-per-second transmission rate. Dig-
 ital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS allows OpenVMS systems to take ad-
 vantage of this technology by enabling TCP/IP communications with other
 hosts in these configurations:

 o  On the same FDDI network

 o  Over a FDDI/Ethernet bridge

 o  Over a router

 OpenVMS hosts are also able to act as an Internet gateway between FDDI
 networks and one or more Ethernets.

 The management of the FDDI controller is integrated with the TCP/IP
 network management interface.

 Auxiliary Server inetd

 The inetd software is the TCP/IP service dispatcher for UNIX systems
 which was first provided by Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) 4.3.

 This feature significantly simplifies the writing of applications and
 manages overhead by reducing the number of simultaneous server pro-
 cesses on the system.

 The Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS implementation of inetd:

 o  Listens for incoming connection requests and appropriately starts
    application services. It controls dynamic process creation in the
    same manner as the UNIX based inetd.

 o  Provides a Services Database.

 o  Provides security features.

                                  4

 

 o  Offers event logging.

 BIND Server

 Translates Domain Name System host names to IP addresses. Network man-
 agers set up a BIND database to configure primary, secondary, and caching
 servers on OpenVMS hosts. This complements the BIND resolver, the client
 part of BIND that requests name-to-address translations from a BIND
 server.

 Remote Booting

 Remote host booting of diskless clients using OpenVMS as the boot server.
 This feature uses the BOOTP and TFTP Protocols to initiate the boot
 request and to download the boot files.

 UCX Management with Command-line Interface

 UCX Management provides DCL-style commands to control and monitor the
 UCX software components.

 Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Agent

 SNMP is the internet standard protocol for network management over TCP
 /IP. The SNMP agent communicates with network management directors to
 provide information about network activity. MIB II variables are sup-
 ported within SNMP.

 Security and Network Access Control

 System managers use network security features to control the acces-
 sibility to OpenVMS systems from remote Internet hosts.

 Application Programming Interfaces

 Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS V4.0 includes the following ap-
 plication programming interfaces:

 -  C socket programming interface
    Provides the Berkeley socket programming interface to develop TCP
    /IP networking applications in the C language.

                                  5

 

 -  QIO programming interface
    Provides a QIO programming interface to develop TCP/IP networking
    applications in any OpenVMS language.

 -  SRIQIO interface
    Provides emulation of the SRIQIO interface.

 -  SunRPC, with XDR and Portmapper
    Sun[R] Remote Procedure Calls (SunRPC) are included in the UCX Pro-
    gramming interface. The SunRPC library includes a library of RPC
    function calls, the Portmapper module, and eXternal Data Represen-
    tation (XDR) routines.

 Applications

 This component includes the widespread end-user protocols for file trans-
 fer, remote login, remote command processing, remote printing, and mail
 exchange.

 o  File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

 FTP is the internet application protocol for file transfer. It enables
 users to transfer files to and from remote hosts.

 o  Telnet

 Telnet is the internet application protocol for remote login. It en-
 ables OpenVMS users to log into remote systems and remote users to log
 into OpenVMS systems.

 Telnet provides support for both character and line modes. It also en-
 ables users to activate multiple Telnet sessions.

 o  Telnet 3270

 Telnet 3270 enables users to make Telnet connections from OpenVMS sys-
 tems to remote IBM[R] systems using a 3270-style terminal interface.

 o  Berkeley Remote Commands (rlogin, rsh, rexec)

 Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS implements the popular UNIX re-
 mote login (rlogin), remote shell (rsh), and remote executive (rexec)
 services.

                                  6

 

 Like Telnet, remote login (rlogin) enables users to log into remote
 systems and remote users to log into OpenVMS systems.

 Rsh enables OpenVMS users to execute commands on remote systems and
 remote users to execute DCL commands on OpenVMS systems. Authentica-
 tion is based on either user password or proxy access.

 o  Remote printing

 Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS provides the following remote print-
 ing services:

 OpenVMS users can issue DCL-style PRINT commands to print files on re-
 mote systems using the LPD protocol.

 Similarly, remote users can print files on OpenVMS systems using the
 LPD protocol.

 OpenVMS users can also use the TELNET Print Symbiont to print files
 on remote systems.

 o  Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)

 SMTP is the internet application protocol for mail. Users can send and
 receive electronic mail to and from remote hosts.

 Network File System

 The NFS[TM] software supports the Network File System (NFS) V2.0 pro-
 tocol specifications. NFS is an application layer protocol that pro-
 vides clients with transparent access to remote file services.

 The NFS server software promotes data sharing among clients by pro-
 viding a central data storage facility for OpenVMS and UNIX files. The
 NFS server software provides two types of file access for remote clients:

 o  Access to OpenVMS files

 o  Access to files that are compatible with the UNIX Operating Sys-
    tem.

                                  7

 

 Automount

 As implemented in Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS, the NFS AUTO-
 MOUNT command transparently mounts and unmounts NFS file systems on
 an as-needed basis, especially useful for mounting file systems and
 directories that are occasionally needed.

 File Conversion On-The-Fly

 Maximizes interoperability between OpenVMS and other systems utiliz-
 ing the NFS Protocol by providing a sequential "read on-the-fly" file
 conversion capability.

 PC-NFS Server

 Remote PC users mount and access NFS files from OpenVMS. UID/GID iden-
 tification and authentication of the remote PC user is established through
 the use of the UCX Proxy Database. Once access is established, users
 can print via the PC-NFS printing mechanism.

 PATHWORKS Integration

 Digital TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS V4.0 supports the PATHWORKS IP driver
 for improved PATHWORKS and TCP/IP integration. (Requires PATHWORKS Ver-
 sion 5 series.)

 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

 Processors Supported: Hardware supported by the OpenVMS operating sys-
 tems V6.0 or later are supported by this product. Reference SPDs for
