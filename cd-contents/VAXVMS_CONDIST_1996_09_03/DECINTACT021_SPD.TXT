 PRODUCT NAME:  DECintact Version 2.1                   SPD 29.58.05

 DESCRIPTION

 The DECintact product provides a foundation for building simple and
 complex transaction processing applications on one or more VAX sys-
 tems under the OpenVMS VAX operating system. The DECintact product runs
 as a collection of services and several processes under the OpenVMS
 VAX operating system. DECintact supports either single-threaded (per-
 process) or multithreaded (server) application program design method-
 ologies. Multiple versions of the DECintact product can execute at the
 same time and share the same physical memory while remaining completely
 independent. The DECintact product offers the following major facil-
 ities:

 o  Front-end services

 o  Database services

 o  Two-phase commit

 o  DECtrace support

 o  LSE templates

 o  Security and menu dispatching

 o  File management and restart/recovery

 o  Queue management

 o  Network management

 Front-end Services

                               DIGITAL                     June 1993

                                                         AE-LC69F-TE

 

 The DECintact product supports DECforms forms or DECintact forms within
 DECintact terminal-based applications. A single system menu can dis-
 play multiple applications, some using DECforms and some using DECin-
 tact forms. However, a single application can not mix forms products.

    DECforms Forms

    Access to DECforms services is available through a set of DECin-
    tact routines. For more information on DECforms, refer to the DEC-
    forms Software Product Description (SPD 29.90.xx).
    DECintact Forms

    DECintact forms supports VT100, VT200, VT300, VT400 (in VT200 em-
    ulation mode) series terminals as though they were intelligent block-
    mode terminals. Programmers create screen forms interactively through
    the Terminal Forms Editor (TFE). Forms are virtual in length, and
    multiple forms can be windowed on a single terminal. Fields on a
    form have video and edit attributes, which are handled by the ter-
    minal management facility. A user-written edit routine facility ex-
    ists, which allows character, field, and form editing to be aug-
    mented by the programmer. The ability to print a hard copy of the
    screen is a built-in service of the terminal management facility.

 Database Services

 The DECintact product allows multithreaded applications to access syn-
 chronous resource managers such as DEC Rdb for OpenVMS VAX and DEC DBMS
 for OpenVMS VAX. Also included are facilities to monitor/configure this
 environment (that is, control the number of server pool instances, and
 monitor overall server pool throughput).

 Two-Phase Commit

 Using the DECdtm component of the OpenVMS VAX operating system, the
 DECintact product can coordinate distributed transactions to perform
 atomic updates to multiple and different resource managers that are
 DECdtm compliant (for example, DEC Rdb for OpenVMS VAX, DEC DBMS for
 OpenVMS VAX, and DECintact queues).

 DECtrace Support

                                  2

 

 The DECintact product allows the collection of performance event data
 by DECtrace at two levels. The first level allows the collection of
 performance event data from within the DECintact code. The second level
 involves allowing application programmers to insert DECtrace calls into
 their application code.

 LSE Templates

 The DECintact product provides LSE DECintact routine templates to al-
 low programmers to generate DECintact applications more quickly and
 accurately.

 Security and Menu Dispatching

 The DECintact product provides a comprehensive security and menu sys-
 tem. A mechanism for establishing security profiles for local/remote
 users and terminals is provided. The DECintact product makes use of
 a hierarchical menu system that permits references to both lower-level
 menus and to menu functions directly invoking applications. All menu
 items can be protected, and users are shown only those items for which
 they have proper entitlement. Hours of operation, password expiration,
 transaction audit, and response-time reports are among the features
 of the DECintact security system.

 File Management

 Digital's Record Management Services (VAX RMS) is used for file and
 record access. The DECintact File Management facility improves upon
 its use of the VAX RMS facility by supporting shared relative files,
 logically deleted records, and implicit file openings. The DECintact
 product also supplies its own hash file access support, which provides
 a high performance method of inserting and retrieving records. All record
 operations are considered atomic for the purposes of restart/recovery.

 There are two options for recovery of VAX RMS files: DECintact Recov-
 ery and RMS Journaling. Both coordinate with DECdtm (Two-Phase Com-
 mit) to provide both recovery-unit journaling and after-image jour-
 naling. DECintact users can choose either recovery method (DECintact
 or VAX RMS Journaling) on a file by file basis.

    DECintact Recovery

    This service is provided as part of the base DECintact product.

    VAX RMS Journaling

                                  4

 

    This is an optional service. For information on VAX RMS Journal-
    ing, refer to the VAX RMS Journaling Software Product Description
    (SPD 27.58.xx).

 Queue Management

 The DECintact product provides a comprehensive set of routines that
 support the creation of disk-based and memory-based queues. A queue
 consists of items that are priority ordered with up to 65,000 prior-
 ity classes per queue. Queue items may be inserted FIFO or in prior-
 ity order and are removed either FIFO or atomic for the purposes of
 restart/recovery. All disk-based queues are fully recoverable. The DECin-
 tact product supports remote queues, queue sets, multiple queue in-
 sertions, enqueue-level threshold alarms, and proof and reconcilia-
 tion statistics.

 Network Management

 The DECintact product supports explicit and implicit remote access at
 the menu-item level and uses DECnet facilities for intersystem com-
 munications. Network access is supported at two levels: peer-to-peer
 and front-end-to-host. Peer-to-peer access allows users with suffi-
 cient entitlement to invoke applications remotely on another partic-
 ipating DECintact system. Front-end-to-host access provides a trans-
 parent method of off-loading forms management (including both built-
 in and user-written validation) and menu level security from a host
 onto a VAX front-end system. A VAX front-end system also offers au-
 tomatic host failure rollover in the event that a CPU within a host
 VAXcluster system fails.

 VAXcluster Features

 The DECintact product supports the building of simple, as well as com-
 plex, VAXcluster applications. All DECintact file accesses, as well
 as all disk-based queue operations, use the OpenVMS distributed lock
 manager to arbitrate clusterwide system resources. The DECintact sys-
 tem support of VAXcluster features, in conjunction with its own restart
 /recovery strategies, can be used to simplify the implementation of
 high availability applications.
