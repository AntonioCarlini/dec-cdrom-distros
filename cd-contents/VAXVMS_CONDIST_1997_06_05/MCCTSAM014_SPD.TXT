 PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER Terminal Server Access Module for OpenVMS,
 SPD 43.99.05                Version 1.4

 DESCRIPTION

 The POLYCENTER Terminal Server Access Module (AM) is a VMS layered prod-
 uct that provides remote management access to Digital terminal servers
 within the DECmcc environment. The POLYCENTER Terminal Server AM al-
 lows DECmcc users to remotely configure and monitor Digital terminal
 servers anywhere in the extended Local Area Network (LAN) from a sys-
 tem running DECmcc.

 POLYCENTER Terminal Server AM is installed and runs on the OpenVMS plat-
 form, DECmcc configurations for the POLYCENTER Framework (formerly DECmcc
 Director), and the POLYCENTER Network Manager 200 (formerly DECmcc Ba-
 sic Management System (BMS)) It is also a component for the POLYCEN-
 TER Network Manager 400 (formerly DECmcc Enterprise Management Sys-
 tem (EMS)).

 POLYCENTER Terminal Server AM V1.4 is the release of software that pro-
 vides migration of the Terminal Server Manager (TSM) capabilities to
 the DECmcc environment.

 The general characteristics of POLYCENTER Terminal Server AM include:

 o  Remote management capabilities for Digital Terminal Servers

 o  Allows for observation, monitoring, and controlling of Digital Ter-
    minal Servers on Local Area Networks

 o  Ability to display and modify devices, links, physical ports, op-
    erational and permanent, LAT/Telnet database characteristics

 o  Customize site specific alarms for the devices stored in the MIR
    (Management Information Respository) for faults, errors, and changed
    information

                                                         AE-PH36B-TE

 

 o  Simultaneous management access by multiple users

 o  On-line Help facility

 o  Similar display formats for all manageable terminal servers

 Management Information Repository (MIR)

 POLYCENTER Terminal Server (TSAM) AM provides a Management Informa-
 tion Repository (MIR) that contains the name, Ethernet address, ter-
 minal server type, and other fields for each server to be managed. Through
 the TSAM MIR, the user needs to refer only to the name of the server
 in order to gain access.

 DECnet Database Modification

 POLYCENTER Terminal Server AM can automatically update the DECnet man-
 agement directory. Users do not need to separately use a DECnet AM to
 update DECnet information. The Terminal Server AM will access the DEC-
 net database itself to do the appropriate modifications.

 Fault Management

 Troubleshooting within the terminal server network is enhanced by TSAM
 providing the ability, centrally, to read traffic status and counters
 in addition to error status and counters. With the ``PASTHRU'' util-
 ity, the user can also connect directly to the server, allowing iso-
 lation of problems between POLYCENTER Terminal Server AM and the server.

 Terminal Server Manager supports the following models of communica-
 tions software:

 o  Ethernet Terminal Server for OpenVMS

 o  DECserver 90L (ROM-resident terminal server software)

 o  DECserver 90L+ (ROM-resident terminal server software)

 o  DECserver 90M for OpenVMS

 o  DECserver 90TL for OpenVMS

 CLUSTER ENVIRONMENT

 This layered product is fully supported when installed on any valid
 and licensed VAXcluster* configuration without restrictions. The HARD-
 WARE REQUIREMENTS section details any special hardware required by this
 product.

 *  V5.x VAXcluster configurations are fully described in the VAXclus-
    ter Software Product Description (29.78.xx) and include CI, Eth-
    ernet, and Mixed Interconnect configurations.

 IMPORTANT INTEROPERABILITY INFORMATION

 Interoperability problems may occur when more than one product con-
 taining DECthreads is installed on a system. This occurs because some
 products overwrite the system version of DECthreads. If a product with
 a different version of DECthreads is installed after POLYCENTER Frame-
 work, problems may occur.

 POLYCENTER Framework V1.4 is linked with DECthreads V1.0-422. Later
 versions of DECthreads have a backwards compatible API. Consequently,
 no problem should result from having a more recent version of DECthreads
 on the system.

 Only SSB versions of DECthreads are supported.

 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

 For Systems Using Terminals (no DECwindows Motif® interface):

 o  OpenVMS VAX Operating System V5.5-2 to V6.1

 o  One of the following POLYCENTER software packages:
