 PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER Security Intrusion Detector  SPD 41.27.03
                for OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha, Ver-
                sion 1.2a

 DESCRIPTION

 POLYCENTER [TM] Security Intrusion Detector (ID) for OpenVMS [TM] (for-
 merly DECinspect[TM] Intrusion Detector) is a security tool that con-
 stantly monitors suspicious or hostile activity and reports any such
 activity to the security manager.

 POLYCENTER Security ID operates in real time, processing audit events
 from the OpenVMS Audit Server as they occur and notifying the secu-
 rity manager via electronic mail. Furthermore, POLYCENTER Security ID
 can be configured to take countermeasures against intruders without
 human intervention.

 Security managers can use this version of POLYCENTER Security ID from
 the DCL command line. If they are running OpenVMS VAX[TM] Version 5.3
 or higher but less than Version 6.0, security managers can also use
 this version of POLYCENTER Security ID from within the POLYCENTER Se-
 curity Compliance Manager for OpenVMS menu system.

 POLYCENTER Security ID does the following:

 o  Notifies security managers about critical security events occur-
    ring on a system, as detected by the OpenVMS Audit Server.

                               DIGITAL                 November 1995

                                                         AE-PQ5ED-TE

 

 The following is a list of these events:

    -  UAF modifications

    -  Proxy modifications

    -  Rights list modifications

    -  Privileged image installations

    -  File access failures

    -  Login successes by hostile users

    -  Break-in events

    -  Login failures

 o  Mails summary or detailed reports about the security events. One
    or more security managers specified on the POLYCENTER Security ID
    security manager list receive the reports. Only some reports are
    sent at specified intervals. Most are sent in real time.

 The following is a list of reports sent in real time:

    -  Notification of a change in the system time.

    -  Full security reports of UAF, proxy, and rights operations.

    -  Full security reports when audit events are modified.

    -  Notification of password modification by users (this is enabled
       by the RID SET REPORT/PASSWORD_SET DCL command).

    -  A report is sent when hostile local or remote users log in and
       when a user from a monitored node logs in.

    -  A report is sent when a security manager uses the RID MONITOR
       DCL command (or the menu interface on OpenVMS VAX Version 5.3
       or higher but less than Version 6.0) to monitor a local or re-
       mote user or a node.

 The following reports are not sent in real time:

    -  Daily login failure summary.

                                  2

 

    -  Full intrusion notification of break-in, install, and mount alarm
       messages. Repeated triggering of the same alarm by the same user
       causes only one mail message over the period of hours given by
       the MAIL_INTERVAL value.

    -  Excessive account failure activity per day (this is the message
       sent when a user exceeds the total login failure threshold).

 o  Initiates countermeasures against hostile users.

    -  If countermeasures are enabled, POLYCENTER Security ID takes ac-
       tion to counteract the security event. For example, a suspected
       intruder process is deleted or a suspected account is disabled
       after an account exceeds a certain number of events.

    -  If countermeasures are not enabled, the security manager still
       receives notification of the events; however, no counteraction
       takes place. For example, the suspected account is not disabled.

    -  Some limited countermeasures are always performed to preserve
       the integrity of POLYCENTER Security ID itself. For example, if
       an unauthorized user disables audit events, POLYCENTER Security
       ID re-enables audit events automatically. Also, POLYCENTER Se-
       curity ID protects its own run-time parameter file and recreates
       it automatically if it is deleted.

 o  Allows security managers to issue commands to POLYCENTER Security
    ID to monitor any suspected user and remote login sources for a spec-
    ified length of time. For example, this feature is used if a known
    local account is being used to penetrate a system and it is desired
    to identify the remote login sources.

 o  Sends security event messages, known as alarm tokens, to a DECnet[TM]
    node running POLYCENTER Security Reporting Facility (SRF) for Open-
    VMS software. Upon receipt of the alarm token, POLYCENTER SRF no-
    tifies the POLYCENTER SRF administrator via electronic mail about
    the security event.



                                  3

 

 Alarm tokens contain information about the node's security manager,
 target entity, source entity, failure type, and failure limit. Stor-
 ing the alarm tokens, gives the administrator access to current and
 historical information about security events occurring on one or more
 nodes across a network.
