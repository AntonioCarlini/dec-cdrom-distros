               for OpenVMS, Version 2.1

DESCRIPTION

In previous versions of POLYCENTER[TM] Security products, the name 
DECinspect was used instead of POLYCENTER Security.

POLYCENTER Security Reporting Facility is a security reporting tool
that collects and manages security compliance and security event 
information sent from the following software tools:

o  POLYCENTER Security Compliance Manager for AIX[R] (SPD 46.11.xx)

o  POLYCENTER Security Compliance Manager for HP-UX[R] (SPD 46.12.xx)

o  POLYCENTER Security Compliance Manager for OpenVMS[TM] (SPD 26.N1.xx)

o  POLYCENTER Security Compliance Manager for ULTRIX[TM] (SPD 41.26.xx)

o  POLYCENTER Security Compliance Manager for SunOS[R] (SPD 41.25.xx)

o  POLYCENTER Security Compliance Manager for Solaris[R] 2 (SPD 55.87.00)

o  POLYCENTER Security Compliance Manager for DEC OSF/1[R] AXP[TM] (SPD
   55.86.00)

o  POLYCENTER Security Intrusion Detector for OpenVMS (SPD 41.27.xx)

POLYCENTER Security Reporting Facility software runs on one or more
nodes to support centralized collection and management of security 
compliance data from nodes running POLYCENTER Security Compliance 
Manager and security events data from nodes running POLYCENTER
Security Intrusion Detector.

POLYCENTER Security Compliance Manager software, a compliance manage-
ment tool, runs on AIX, HP-UX, OpenVMS, ULTRIX, Solaris 2, DEC OSF/1
AXP, and SunOS nodes in a customer's network and periodically eval-
uates compliance with a baseline security policy defined for that node's
operating system. Optionally, POLYCENTER Security Compliance Manager
forwards the compliance data to the POLYCENTER Security Reporting
Facility node.

POLYCENTER Security Intrusion Detector software, an intrusion detec-
tion tool, runs on OpenVMS , SunOS and ULTRIX nodes in a customer's
network and notifies security managers about security events
occurring on the node. Optionally, POLYCENTER Security Intrusion
Detector for OpenVMS sends the data to the POLYCENTER Security Reporting
Facility node, where the designated POLYCENTER Security Reporting
Facility adminstrator is notified about these events.

With these tools, the security manager can implement and maintain a
security policy for nodes running the AIX, HP-UX, OpenVMS, ULTRIX, 
Solaris 2, DEC OSF/1 AXP, or SunOS operating systems.

While POLYCENTER Security Compliance Manager can be used alone in small
distributed systems, the centralized management capabilities of POLY-
CENTER Security Reporting Facility can be very helpful in managing a
large number of nodes or a set of nodes on a dispersed network.

If centralized management is desired, the customer will establish one
or more POLYCENTER Security Reporting Facility installations on the
network. Typically, POLYCENTER Security Reporting Facility installa-
tions are set up to support the organizational reporting structure (for
example, one POLYCENTER Security Reporting Facility node for each 
organizational management domain).

POLYCENTER Security Reporting Facility software performs integrity checks
to prevent unauthorized modification of tokens transmitted from POLY-
CENTER Security Compliance Manager and POLYCENTER Security Intrusion
Detector installations.

Once the system is configured, the POLYCENTER Security Reporting
Facility software collects the tokens and automatically stores the
data in a relational database.

                                 2

 

The database stores the following security compliance data:

o  Node name

o  Network address

o  Cluster name

o  Summary status of POLYCENTER Security Compliance Manager test 
   collection results

o  Detailed status of POLYCENTER Security Compliance Manager test
   collection results

o  Status of policy file in use

o  POLYCENTER Security Compliance Manager policy file information

o  Operating system

o  Operating system version

o  POLYCENTER Security Compliance Manager version

o  Inspection date

o  Received date

The POLYCENTER Security Reporting Facility software stores the 
compliance data so designated users can access current as well as 
historical data to manage the security compliance of nodes on the
network.

The database stores the following security event data:

o  Node name

o  Network address

o  Target entity

o  Source entity

o  Alarm time

o  Received time

o  Failure type

                                 3

 

o  Failure limit

o  Security contact information

   -  Name

   -  Location

   -  Electronic mail address

   -  Phone-1

   -  Phone-2

The POLYCENTER Security Reporting Facility software stores the 
security event data sent by POLYCENTER Security Intrusion Detector. 
Designated users can access current as well as historical data to 
monitor the security events occurring on OpenVMS nodes in the
network.

The security manager can use the POLYCENTER Security Reporting
Facility software to:

o  Display the security status of any AIX, HP-UX, OpenVMS, ULTRIX, 
   Solaris 2, DEC OSF/1 AXP, or SunOS node within the management domain
   of a particular POLYCENTER Security Reporting Facility
   installation.

o  Automatically notify system managers and group managers about the
   compliance status of their node or cluster via electronic mail.

o  Automatically notify system managers and group managers about
   missing compliance status information via electronic mail.

o  Produce reports about the compliance status of nodes or groups.

o  Produce reports about missing compliance status information.

o  Produce reports about implementation trends of the POLYCENTER 
   Security Compliance Manager product on different platforms.

o  Display and produce reports from information in the POLYCENTER
   Security Reporting Facility database.

                                 4

 

o  Forward tokens to another POLYCENTER Security Reporting Facility
   installation automatically in a reporting structure consistent with
   the customer's organizational structure.

o  Store and access data about the manager responsible for a node or
   a group of nodes.

o  Store and access data about valid policy files used by the nodes
   running POLYCENTER Security Compliance Manager software. POLYCEN-
   TER Security Compliance Manager policy files contain the settings
   established by the security manager consistent with the organiza-
   tion's baseline security policy. POLYCENTER Security Reporting 
   Facility works with POLYCENTER Security Compliance Manager to
   perform integrity checks to protect against unauthorized modification
   of POLYCENTER Security Compliance Manager policy files.

o  Schedule tasks, such as producing reports or forwarding tokens, to
   run automatically.

The security managers can also write their own programs to extract data
from other sources for storage in the POLYCENTER Security Reporting
Facility database as well as produce other reports using any of the
following Digital software products:

   RDO and SQL utilities of DEC Rdb for OpenVMS (SPD 25.59.xx)
   DEC Rdb for OpenVMS precompilers (SPD 25.59.xx)
