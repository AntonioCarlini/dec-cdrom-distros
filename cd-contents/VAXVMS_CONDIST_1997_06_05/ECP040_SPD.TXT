PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER Capacity Planner,            SPD 36.04.09
               Version 4.0

DESCRIPTION

POLYCENTER Capacity Planner

The POLYCENTER Capacity Planner modeling component is used to predict
the performance of standalone and clustered OpenVMS VAX, OpenVMS Al-
pha, and Digital UNIX systems, as well as other UNIX systems such as
IBM AIX[[R]], HP-UX[[R]], Sun Solaris[[R]], Pyramid DC/OSx[[R]], and
Sequent DYNIX/ptx[[R]] platforms. The Capacity Planner modeling com-
ponent determines system performance levels for various workloads and
configurations. The modeling component also handles data collected on
these platforms. Performance predictions are based on an analytic queu-
ing network model.

The modeling component includes a graphical modeling interface from
which "what-if" analyses can be performed. A baseline model is cre-
ated from information collected by the POLYCENTER Performance Data Col-
lectors. This baseline model becomes the starting point for assess-
ing the impact of changes to the configuration or the workloads. Users
can add, delete, or change any hardware component or workload, and ex-
amine the impact on performance by viewing various performance met-
rics, such as: utilization, response times, throughput, queue length,
and service time. Models can be saved for further evaluation. The "what-
if" analyses form the foundation of capacity plans.

The POLYCENTER Capacity Planner allows the user to define the system's
total workload in terms of manageable units. Workloads are expressed
as classes that include groups of processes (for both OpenVMS and UNIX

                                                     November, 1996

with similar characteristics). These classes are used in model gen-
eration. Workload classes can be defined according to users, UICs, pro-
cess name, account name, and process mode. Subclasses are a set of trans-
actions under a class. These may be images if the images function as
transactions. Workloads are thus able to be expressed as a class/subclass
table for transaction performance statistics. UNIX subclasses are not
supported since a process runs one and only one image (command).

The POLYCENTER Capacity Planner provides performance information for
each CPU, HSC, disk, channel, adapter, bridge, router, switch, and in-
terconnect at both current and projected workloads or configurations.
This includes support for volume shadowing, disk striping, and RAID
levels 0, 1, 0+1, 3, 5, and 6.

The POLYCENTER Capacity Planner supports the following network pro-
tocols:

o  SCS

o  NSP/DECnet

o  OSI/DECnet

o  TCP/IP

o  UDP/IP

o  LAT

o  IPX/SPX

The network subsystem, as it pertains to system-based capacity plan-
ning, is the set of network components and protocols for which com-
munications of workload traverses selected network path(s) over all
capacity planning end-node pairs. The modeling focus of the network
subsystem is to support end-to-end response time modeling, network de-
vice performance, and client/server capacity planning (extended LAN
support, and WAN).


                                 2

 

Client/server support is provided in that software servers may be de-
fined to serve one or more clients. Multiple levels of software servers
are allowed. POLYCENTER Capacity Planner will support capacity plan-
ning for environments that include applications whose client/server
components are implemented on multiple CPUs.

The performance statistics are provided in either summary or detailed
table reports, as well as graph reports, and include:

o  Resource utilization

o  Response time

o  Throughput

o  Queue length

o  Service time

In addition to their reporting functions, graph reports allow you to
perform modeling activities such as user load balancing in a dynamic,
visual manner.

POLYCENTER Capacity Planner provides prediction reporting that indi-
cates the workload size at which a component will saturate. The re-
port shows the system performance at incremental increases of work-
load up to the saturation point. The increment steps are 25 percent
of initial component utilization. After an increase to 100 percent,
only the saturation point is shown.

The saturation analysis identifies bottlenecks before they occur, al-
lowing the system manager to be proactive in eliminating bottlenecks
and providing a consistent level of system performance to users.

Features

POLYCENTER Capacity Planner provides the user with the capabilities
to plan effectively for future computer resource needs:

o  A graphical modeling interface provides an easy-to-use tool for per-
   forming multiple "what-if" analyses.

                                 3

 

o  Work performed by OpenVMS and UNIX systems can be grouped into mean-
   ingful categories.

POLYCENTER Capacity Planner has two portions: the Modeler/Characterizer
and the Data Integrator. The Data Integrator compresses performance
data collected from one or more nodes by Data Collectors. In addition
to data collected on OpenVMS and Digital UNIX systems, the Data In-
tegrator processes data collected on IBM AIX, HP-UX, Sun Solaris, DC
/OSx, and DYNIX/ptx platforms. The Modeler/Characterizer provides the
following functions:

o  Performance modeling is supported for standalone systems with the
   above operating systems and clustered systems.

o  "What-if" analysis provides performance characteristics of the sys-
   tem before actual changes are implemented.

o  Built-in configuration rules assist in modeling and validating sup-
   ported configurations.

o  Saturation analysis identifies the workload at which system com-
   ponents will saturate and performance bottlenecks will occur.

o  CPU priority modeling is supported.

o  Extended LAN protocols and components are supported.

o  WAN protocols and components are supported.

o  Client/server application environments are supported.

o  Modeling for clients (PCs) that talk to an OpenVMS VAX or OpenVMS
   Alpha system using PATHWORKS is supported.

o  Context-sensitive Help is available.

o  All hardware that runs OpenVMS or Digital UNIX can be modelled.
