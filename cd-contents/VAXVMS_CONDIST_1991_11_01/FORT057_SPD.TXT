           PRODUCT NAME:  VAX FORTRAN, Version 5.7               SPD
           25.16.37
           \)

           DESCRIPTION

           VAX FORTRAN is an implementation of full language FORTRAN-77
           conforming to American National Standard FORTRAN, ANSI X3.9-
           1978. It includes optional support for programs conforming
           to the previous standard, ANSI X3.9-1966. VAX FORTRAN meets
           the Federal Information Processing Standard Publication (FIPS-
           69-1) requirements by conforming to the ANSI Standard and
           by including a flagger. The flagger optionally produces di-
           agnostic messages for compile-time elements that do not con-
           form to the Full-Level ANSI FORTRAN X3.9-1978 Standard. VAX FORTRAN
           also conforms to the International Standard ISO 1539-1980(E).
           VAX FORTRAN conforms to MIL-STD 1753 with the exception of
           the specific syntax for octal and hex constants.

           The shareable, reentrant compiler operates under the VMS Op-
           erating System. It globally optimizes source programs while
           taking advantage of the VAX floating point and character string
           instruction set and the VMS virtual memory system.

           VAX FORTRAN includes the following enhancements to the ANSI
           standard:

           o  Directives to support parallel decomposition of DO-loops
              on multiprocessor VMS systems

           o  Directives to control listing page titles and subtitles,
              object file identification field, and some attributes of
              common blocks

           o  Removal of invariant expressions from loops

           o  Global allocation of general registers across program units

           o  In-line expansion of statement functions

           o  Optimization of array addressing in loops

           o  Value propagation

           o  Deletion of redundant and unreachable code

           Note: VAX FORTRAN does not support the use of FDML state-
           ments within parallel DO-loops.
