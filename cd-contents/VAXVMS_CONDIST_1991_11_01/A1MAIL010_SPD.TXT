          PRODUCT NAME:  ALL-IN-1 MAIL, Version 1.0           SPD 31.51.00

          DESCRIPTION

          ALL-IN-1 MAIL is an electronic messaging application which im-
          plements the international messaging standards set by the CCITT
          X.400 P2 recommendations. It provides a means of exchanging
          messages and attached data with other users, and is a consis-
          tent user interface across heterogeneous desktop devices in a
          client/server implementation.

          Layered on top of Digital Equipment Corporation's VAX Message
          Router (SPD 26.33.xx), ALL-IN-1 MAIL interacts with all other
          MAILbus gateways and complementary products.

          ALL-IN-1 MAIL is a client/server implementation supporting Video
          Terminals, DOS PCs and DECwindows VMS workstations. ALL-IN-1
          MAIL represents an upgrade path for current users of Digital's
          VMS Personal Mail Utility (VMSmail), DECwindows VMSmail or the
          PC Mail interfaces provided with the DECnet/PCSA product set.

          ALL-IN-1 MAIL has no technical dependency whatsoever on the
          ALL-IN-1 integrated office product. It may be used entirely
          independent of that product. DOS and DECwindows clients are
          also available which connect directly into the ALL-IN-1 in-
          tegrated office system base, and do not require the ALL-IN-1
          MAIL Server. These products are known as ALL-IN-1 DESKtop for
          DOS (SPD 50.20.xx) and ALL-IN-1 DESKtop for VMS DECwindows (SPD
          31.80.xx).

          Client software performs services for the user. This software
          usually resides on an intelligent desktop device and takes
          advantage of the processing power on the desk.

          Clients are connected to the ALL-IN-1 MAIL Server, through which
          local- and wide-area network delivery services are performed.

          Transport between ALL-IN-1 MAIL Servers and between ALL-IN-1
          MAIL and the other products in the ALL-IN-1 Phase II product
          family is performed by the VAX Message Router. Optional gateways
          may also be connected to the VAX Message Router as needed for
          mail transfer in a multi-vendor environment.

          A user might alternately use an intelligent workstation in the
          office, a video terminal at home, and a DOS laptop PC while
          traveling. Clients are provided for all three situations, all
          using the same user mailbox and files on the server.

          ALL-IN-1 MAIL conforms to the National Institute for Science and
          Technology (NIST) profile of 1984 CCITT X.400 recommendations.
          It provides a level of messaging service compatible with that of
          the electronic messaging subsystem of the ALL-IN-1 integrated
          office system, and adds new service elements defined in ALL-IN-1
          MAIL.

          Features

          Compatibility with VMSmail

          Users can migrate easily from VMSmail to ALL-IN-1 MAIL. The in-
          terfaces are logical extensions of the VMSmail interface and
          commands and services will be familiar. Addresses and distribu-
          tion lists used in VMSmail can be used in ALL-IN-1 MAIL. From
          the VMS-resident clients, nickname logicals may be used. Most
          addresses used in VMSmail distribution lists may be used in
          ALL-IN-1 MAIL with similar restrictions as found when using
          such a list from another node. (See product documentation for
          details.) ALL-IN-1 MAIL does not support address strings which
          invoke a foreign protocol from VMSmail (e.g. PSI%).

          No file cabinet conversion is required for either of the VMS-
          based interfaces. A one-time file cabinet conversion is required
          to make VMSmail messages available from the PC.

          Messages can be exchanged with VMSmail on the same system or
          elsewhere in the DECnet network by means of the VAX Message
          Router VMSmail Gateway. This can be purchased as an option or is
          included in the ALL-IN-1 MAIL Wide Area Network Server Package.

          Users can select an editor for use in ALL-IN-1 MAIL. Any edi-
          tor which is called or spawned under VMSmail can be called or
          spawned from ALL-IN-1 MAIL. Editors which may be called from a
          .BAT file can be implemented under ALL-IN-1 MAIL for DOS.

          Compatibility with ALL-IN-1

          Messages can be exchanged with the ALL-IN-1 integrated office
          system by means of the VAX Message Router using the same style
          of addressing.

          The services of ALL-IN-1 MAIL are compatible with services in
          the electronic messaging subsystem of ALL-IN-1. For example,
          receipt requests from either product are honored by the other.
          New features defined in the CCITT X.400 P2 recommendations may
          be implemented in stages by both products.

          Distribution lists created in the ALL-IN-1 integrated office
          system can be used in ALL-IN-1 MAIL. They will work with the
          same restrictions found when sending a list to another ALL-IN-1
          office system node. (See product documentation for details.)
          Addressing strings used in the ALL-IN-1 office system will work
          equally well in ALL-IN-1 MAIL, with the exception of those which
          invoke ALL-IN-1's foreign protocol hook (those beginning with
          underscore).




          X.400 Message Transport

          Messages can be exchanged with other ALL-IN-1 MAIL domains and
          services which meet international X.400 P2 conformance criteria.
          Conformance testing is going on in the United States and Europe.

          In ALL-IN-1 MAIL, each customer network is referred to as a
          "domain". Within a customer network, messages are transported
          by means of DECnet wherever DECnet is available. Transport to
          another vendor's X.400 service requires an OSI networking stack
          and the VAX Message Router X.400 Gateway (MRX).

          OSI message exchange requires at least one MRX Gateway in each
          Digital domain (usually one per customer network). Refer to the
          VAX Message Router X.400 Gateway Software Product Description
          (SPD 27.50.xx) for hardware/software requirements.

          Supporting the Multi-Vendor Environment

          MAILbus offers a series of off-the-shelf gateways and a gateway
          development kit to create other gateways for message exchange
          with other vendors' proprietary mail systems. Refer to the
          Software Product Description (SPD) for the appropriate products'
          hardware/software requirements.

          Directory Services

          ALL-IN-1 MAIL uses Digital's Enterprise-wide Directory Service
          (DDS) as its user address directory. This distributed directory,
          available as part of the VAX Message Router, links ALL-IN-1
          MAIL, the ALL-IN-1 integrated office system, the gateways, and
          any other agents sharing its directory services.

          Users can access the DDS directory while addressing a memo or
          creating an entry in their Personal Address Book (PAB). The PAB
          is an integral part of the ALL-IN-1 MAIL and is located in each
          user's personal mail account, or in the local file store on the
          intelligent client device. The user references a PAB entry by
          using its user-assigned nickname. Distribution lists may contain
          nicknames.

          The DDS directory is a networking resource available only while
          the server connection is in place. If messages are created and
          addressed on a PC in the absence of the server connection, the
          user can still use locally stored nicknames and distribution
          lists, or type the full address string.

          Distribution lists are simple text files stored in the user's
          mail area. These distribution lists can be shared among a group
          of users by using the VMS Access Control facilities and DEC-
          net/PCSA.

          Filing Services

          ALL-IN-1 MAIL provides a filing structure of drawers and folders
          as well as access to RMS files. Filing services are similar in
          nature to VMSmail. The DOS client has the same filing struc-
          ture of drawers and folders on the PC, and a drawer on the VMS
          server. The PC can also access files stored on the local DOS
          device.

          Message Retrieval

          Messages can be retrieved based on user specification of certain
          header fields and filing structures.

          File Formats

          As detailed below, a number of different editors may be used
          with the various interfaces. With those editors comes a variety
          of file formats. ALL-IN-1 MAIL is designed to handle various
          file formats with features that allow configuration for maximum
          readability of messages. The system allows for the automated
          handling of messages in ASCII, DDIF, WPS-PLUS and DX, and for
          invocation of other file formatting or conversion routines that
          conform to Digital's Compound Document Architecture (CDA), or to
          standard DOS conventions.

          For advice on interchange of specific file formats, especially
          across gateways, please consult with your local Digital office.

          There may be some difficulties exchanging DDIF documents with
          ALL-IN-1, Version 2.3. Contact your local Digital office for
          details.

          Help

          Users can get help for ALL-IN-1 MAIL using the HELP facility.
          HELP provides basic information on how to perform the function
          in question without the user having to reference the documenta-
          tion.

          Printing

          ALL-IN-1 MAIL takes advantage of Digital's standard VMS printing
          facilities provided under VMS and VMS Services for PCs. The user
          can specify the printer destination and options.

          Messaging Functions

          Users can create, read, and send messages using the commands
          provided. Messages can contain information in a variety of file
          format types, including Digital's Document Interchange Format
          for compound documents (DDIF).

          Messages can be forwarded to another destination. Message at-
          tachments may include another message, a document or file, or
          even a binary file.

          Answering a message is easy. The system automatically addresses
          the answer for transfer back to the original sender. The user
          can reply to the sender, all the original recipients, or to a
          reply-to list.

          Messages can be addressed to one or more users at any valid
          MAILbus destination (e.g. VMSmail, ULTRIX mail, or X.400 and
          so on) worldwide. File formats may possibly be modified by
          gateways or user agents in order to make the memo readable to
          the recipient. Not all file formats are handled by all gateways
          and user agents. Care should be taken in planning the network
          capabilities to insure maximum readability of memos.

          Notifications

          Delivery and Receipt tags can be attached to a message. These
          will cause a notification message to be generated and returned
          to the originator when the message is delivered or received.

          Message Redirection

          The user can request that all incoming messages be automatically
          redirected to a secondary address.

          Priority-based Delivery

          Users can choose the priority at which a message is delivered.
          The grade of delivery (express, first class, second class) can
          be specified. Other transport services are also available.

          Message Classes

          The user can set a number of indicators which give the recipient
          information about the nature of the message: Importance (high,
          medium, low), Sensitivity (not restricted, personal, private,
          company confidential).

          Expiration dates may be applied to messages to help facilitate
          automatic removal over time.

          System Management

          Required local system management for the mail system is minimal
          and usually automated. A system manager or administrator is
          required to open a standard VMS account; most routine functions
          can be performed by the users.

          There are no special utilities to run for file cabinet mainte-
          nance. One or all user areas on the server can be backed up or
          restored using standard VMS or PCSA utilities. Management of the
          file structures available to the PC user are under the control
          of the user.

          The mail management design adheres to the coordinated management
          system used by the MAILbus family of products. The ALL-IN-1 MAIL
          Server provides a management utility which allows configuration
          changes to be made and the status of the mail system to be
          checked. Invoking this utility via the VMS SYSMAN utility allows
          such operations to be managed centrally.

          Internationalization

          ALL-IN-1 MAIL is designed to support multi-lingual operations.
          It can be deployed in a multi-lingual network and can support
          multi-lingual operations on a single server system. For more
          information, refer to the System Support Addendum (SSA 31.51.00-
          x).

          ALL-IN-1 MAIL Documentation

          Documentation of the installation, system management, and user
          procedures is included with the individual kits. The Server
          media kit includes the software and installation instructions
          for the DECwindows and Video Terminals clients.

          Packaging

          ALL-IN-1 MAIL for Video Terminals, ALL-IN-1 MAIL for VMS DECwin-
          dows, and ALL-IN-1 MAIL Server for VMS are layered software
          products which reside on VMS. ALL-IN-1 MAIL for DOS is a layered
          software product which resides on DOS.

          ALL-IN-1 MAIL for Video Terminals

          ALL-IN-1 MAIL for Video Terminals looks very much like VMSmail,
          but communicates directly with the Message Router and uses
          a rich protocol which accesses the full range of messaging
          services. This client is co-located with the ALL-IN-1 MAIL
          Server. It provides ordinary terminals with the same access
          to the services of ALL-IN-1 MAIL. Because it shares the same
          server with the DOS and DECwindows clients, it can be used as a
          work at home alternative for users of those more capable desktop
          devices.

          Compatibility with VMSmail

          Users can migrate from the VMS Personal Mail Utility (VMSmail)
          to ALL-IN-1 MAIL for Video Terminals. The command-line interface
          is a logical extension of the VMSmail command interface, and
          commands and services in ALL-IN-1 MAIL for Video Terminals will
          feel familiar. Addresses, nickname logicals, and distribution
          lists used in VMSmail may be used in ALL-IN-1 MAIL for Video
          Terminals.

          ALL-IN-1 MAIL for Video Terminals can locate and view messages
          in the existing VMSmail file cabinet, and copy them into the
          ALL-IN-1 MAIL file cabinet.

          Editors

          The default editor is a simple text editor.

          The VMS-based user can choose from a number of different Digital
          editors as well as third party editors. Any editor which can
          be called or spawned from VMSmail can be called or spawned from
          ALL-IN-1 MAIL.

          ALL-IN-1 MAIL for VMS DECwindows

          ALL-IN-1 MAIL for VMS DECwindows is a DECwindows implementation
          of the client software component of ALL-IN-1 MAIL. It adheres to
          the DECwindows Style Guide and can be used either on a worksta-
          tion, which is a member of the same Local Area VAXcluster as the
          server software, or remotely using an X11 display server device
          supported by Digital.

          Access from Other Platforms

          Since ALL-IN-1 MAIL conforms to the DECwindows standards, users
          of devices which have X-servers available can access the mail
          software. In this case, the message composition and storage
          activities are not handled on the desktop device but on the
          ALL-IN 1 MAIL platform. The windows display is handled by the

          desktop device. This feature provides access for additional
          desktop devices that conform to the DECwindows standards.

          Compatibility with VMSmail and DECwindows VMSmail

          Users can migrate from the VMS Personal Mail Utility (VMSmail)
          or DECwindows VMSmail to ALL-IN-1 MAIL for VMS DECwindows.
          The interface is a logical extension of the DECwindows VMS-
          mail interface; commands and services in ALL-IN-1 MAIL for VMS
          DECwindows will feel familiar. Addresses, nickname logicals, and
          distribution lists used in VMSmail may be used in ALL-IN-1 MAIL
          for VMS DECwindows.

          ALL-IN-1 MAIL for VMS DECwindows can copy messages from the ex-
          isting VMSmail file cabinet into the ALL-IN-1 MAIL file cabinet.

          Editors

          The default editor is a simple text editor.

          The DECwindows user can choose from a number of different Digi-
          tal editors as well as third party editors. Editors that are
          called or spawned from DECwindows VMSmail can be called or
          spawned from ALL-IN-1 MAIL for VMS DECwindows, including such
          windows editors as DECwrite.

          ALL-IN-1 MAIL for DOS

          ALL-IN-1 MAIL for DOS is a DOS character-cell implementation
          of the client software component of ALL-IN-1 MAIL. It may be
          used on any configuration supported by DECnet/PCSA Client. The
          license for this client is bundled with DECnet PCSA Client for
          DOS, Version 3.0.

          Compatibility with VMSmail and PC MAIL

          Users can migrate from the VMS Personal Mail Utility (VMSmail)
          or DECnet PCSA's PC MAIL to ALL-IN-1 MAIL for DOS. The interface
          is a logical extension of the PC MAIL interface and commands and
          services in ALL-IN-1 MAIL for DOS will feel familiar. Addresses
          and distribution lists used in VMSmail may be used in ALL-IN-1
          MAIL for DOS.

          Messages in the existing VMSmail file cabinet on the server can
          be copied into the ALL-IN-1 MAIL server file cabinet using the
          VT interface. Once copied into the ALL-IN-1 MAIL file cabinet,
          they are visible from ALL-IN-1 MAIL for DOS.

          Editors

          The default editor is a simple text editor.

          The DOS-based user can choose from a number of different Digital
          editors as well as third party editors. Editors that are invoked
          using "command filename" from a DOS command file can be used
          under ALL-IN 1 MAIL for DOS.

          Editor implementation .BAT files are supplied for several PC
          editors written by third parties. These editor implementation
          files are provided on an "AS IS" basis without warranty of any
          kind, either express or implied.

          The user can attach any message, document, or file, including
          binary files. On the PC, file conversion routines can be im-
          plemented using .BAT files to perform translation upon READ and
          EDIT.

          Memory Restriction for PCs

          ALL-IN-1 MAIL for DOS has been designed to be used on a broad
          range of PCs. For more information, refer to the System Support
          Addendum (SSA 31.51.00-x).

          ALL-IN-1 MAIL for DOS does not require extended or expanded
          memory. However, where extended memory has been installed,
          ALL-IN-1 MAIL for DOS provides better performance.

          ALL-IN-1 MAIL cannot run under MS-Windows because of memory
          constraints.

          ALL-IN-1 MAIL is unable to handle more than 100 TOs and 100 CCs
          in a given message due to memory constraints.

          Remote Access for PCs

          PCs may connect to the ALL-IN-1 MAIL Server in one of two ways:

          o  Over Local Area Networks, connecting to the ALL-IN-1 MAIL
             Server via DECnet,
             or

          o  Dialing in from remote locations by means of asynchronous
             DECnet.

          The dial-in point can be located anywhere within the wide area
          network. The PC user can choose to perform most functions with-
          out a live connection to the server. The user can connect, fetch
          messages, and disconnect. Messages can be read, filed, and an-
          swers prepared in the absence of the server connection. The user
          can then dial up, connect, and post all prepared messages at
          once.

          HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

          VAX, MicroVAX, VAXstation and PC configurations as specified in
          the System Support Addendum (SSA 31.51.00-x).
