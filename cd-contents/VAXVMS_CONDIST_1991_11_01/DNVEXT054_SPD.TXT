           DECnet-VAX, Version 5.4 Extensions          SPD 29.03.00


           The DECnet-VAX DNS extension supports the optional use of
           the VAX Distributed Name Service (DNS) namespace to store
           node names and addresses for DECnet-VAX. To access node in-
           formation, a DECnet-VAX node can use the local DECnet node
           name database, the DNS namespace, or both.

           A node name management tool helps users helps users with names-
           pace management tasks such as registration of existing node
           names and addresses and the creation, modification, and dele-
           tion of node names and associated information.

           Digital's Distributed Time Service (DECdts) provides a pre-
           cise, fault-tolerant clock synchronization for systems in
           a local and wide area network.

           The DECdts clerk and server are included in the DECnet-VAX
           Extensions kit. The DNS clerk is included in the VMS kit.
           Use of the namespace by DECnet-VAX requires at least one DNS
           server (see SPD 28.79.xx) in the network.

           OSI Stack

           DECnet-VAX
           Extensions software provides a full OSI stack running in par-
           allel with the DECnet stack. The OSI components provide com-
           plete interoperability with multivendor systems that imple-
           ment the Open System Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model,
           as defined by the International Organization for Standard-
           ization (ISO).

           The extensions include the following OSI components:

           o  File Transfer, Access and Management (FTAM)

           o  OSI Applications Kernel (OSAK)

           o  OSI Transport Service (VOTS)

           o  Packetnet System Interface (P.S.I.) Access

           DECnet-VAX, Version 5.4 Extensions          SPD 29.03.00


           o  Wide Area Network Device Drivers (WANDD)

           which are for use only in an environment in which the DECnet-VAX
           Extensions are installed.

           FTAM

           The VAX FTAM V2.0 component provides the following file op-
           erations between OSI-compliant systems:

           o  Copying files

           o  Appending, deleting, and renaming files

           o  Displaying directory information about files

           VAX FTAM implements the OSI File Transfer, Access and Man-
           agement service element and uses the OSI upper layers; the
           Association Control Service Element (ACSE) of the Applica-
           tion layer, the Presentation layer, and the Session layer.
           VAX FTAM runs over Transport layer Classes 0, 2, or 4 over
           Connection Oriented networks or Class 4 over Connectionless
           networks using ISO 8802-3 (Ethernet) or X.25 subnetworks.

           Further information is in the VAX FTAM appendix.

           OSAK

           The OSI Applications Kernel V2.0 provides the Association
           Control Service Element (ACSE) of the OSI Application layer,
           and the Presentation and Session layers. These upper lay-
           ers of the OSI stack enable inter-process communication be-
           tween cooperating applications over an OSI network.

           The Session layer implements ISO Session V1, and ISO Ses-
           sion V2 (unlimited user data) under the National Institute
           of Standards and Technology (NIST) agreements.

           VAX OSAK provides the upper layer services for OSI appli-
           cations running over Transport layer Classes 0, 2, or 4 over
           Connection Oriented networks, or Class 4 over Connection-
           less networks using ISO 8802-3 (Ethernet) or X.25 subnet-
           works.

           Further information is in the VAX OSI Applications Kernel
           appendix.

           VOTS

           The VAX OSI Transport Service V3.0 provides the Transport
           layer, and parts of the Network layer, services of the OSI
           reference model. VOTS supports Transport Classes 0, 2, and
           4 on Connection Oriented networks and Class 4 on Connection-
           less networks, and End System to Intermediate System (ES-
           IS) routing.

           The Transport layer provides reliable end-to-end transfer
           of data between cooperating applications. The Network layer
           provides the communication between Transport layer entities.

           VOTS uses two types of network service:

           o  The Connectionless Network Service (CLNS) using the In-
              ternet protocol (ISO 8473) and ES-IS protocol (ISO 9542)
              to communicate across linked subnetworks. The inactive
              subset of ISO 8473 (null internet) is also supported for
              communication over a single ISO 8802-3 local area net-
              work.

           o  The Connection Oriented Network Service (CONS) for com-
              munication over X.25 subnetworks. CONS uses VAX P.S.I.
              or VAX P.S.I. Access for connection to X.25 subnetworks.

           Further information is in the VAX OSI Transport Service ap-
           pendix.

           DECnet-VAX, Version 5.4 Extensions          SPD 29.03.00


           VAX Packetnet System Interface Access allows communication
           over Packet Switching Data Networks (PSDNs) and implements
           the CCITT X.25 recommendation (1978, 1980, 1984).

           VAX P.S.I. Access uses a connector node to provide the phys-
           ical connection to a PSDN. A connector node can be an X25router
           100/2000 (SPD 28.86.xx), a DEC X25gateway 100/500 (SPD 32.97.xx)
           or VAX P.S.I. V4.3 configured in multi-host mode (SPD 25.40.xx).
           VAX P.S.I. is also included in the DECnet-VAX Extensions kit
           but can be used only with the purchase of a separate VAX P.S.I.
           License.

           Systems with DECnet-VAX and VAX P.S.I. can run X.25 over a
           Local Area Network (LAN) using the LLC type 2 protocol of
           ISO 8802/2 allowing X.25 multivendor communications over a
           LAN.

           Further information is in the Packetnet System Interface ap-
           pendix.

           Network Device Drivers

           The bottom two OSI layers control the transfer of data over
           links between defined points in the network. They are im-
           plemented by hardware communications devices and their as-
           sociated VMS device drivers. Different communications de-
           vices and drivers are required depending on whether connec-
           tion is to a local area or a wide area network.

           Local Area

           The VAX Ethernet controller and VMS Ethernet device drivers
           provide Local Area support.

           This implementation allows shared access to the Ethernet Con-
           trollers. Digital products, such as DECnet-VAX, can run con-
           currently. In addition, customer-written applications that
           directly access the VMS Ethernet drivers can run concurrently
           with the implementation, provided it does not use the same

           Local Service Access Point (LSAP) defined internationally
           to indicate an implementation of the Internet Protocol (X'FE').

           Wide Area

           The Wide Area Network Device Drivers included in this kit
           support synchronous communications. Some device drivers are
           reserved for use by Digital software products while others
           offer a supported user ($QIO) interface. The device drivers
           all support full duplex and half duplex operation, where ap-
           propriate to the protocol.

           Further information is in the Wide Area Network Device Drivers
           appendix.

           Management

           The DECnet Phase V network management allows DECnet-VAX net-
           work managers to manage the OSI lower layer components and
           remote DECnet/OSI systems, including managing and down-line
           loading the DEC WANrouter 100/500 (SPD 32.98.xx).

           The Network Control Language (NCL) is the DECnet/OSI net-
           work management command-line interface. The structure and
           syntax of NCL reflects the DECnet/OSI internal structure of
           the network management components. The Network Control Pro-
           gram (NCP) is used to manage the existing DECnet-VAX com-
           ponents.

           NCL uses the Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP).
           CMIP permits entity management from a single location any-
           where in the DECnet network.

           The Common Trace Facility (CTF) allows the network manager
           to collect and display information about specific protocol
           exchanges between systems.

           Documentation

           The documentation for the DECnet-VAX Extensions is supplied
           in three parts: the core set covering all the main features,
           and two optional sets for Programming (describes the VOTS,
           P.S.I., WANDD, and DECdts programming interfaces) and X.25
           (security, accounting, X.29 and P.S.I. Mail). Programming
           interfaces for OSAK and FTAM are described in the OSI Ap-
           plication Developer's Toolkit (see SDP 34.98.xx).

           INSTALLATION

           Digital requires that a customer's first use of VAX P.S.I.
           include Digital Installation Services. These services pro-
           vide for installation of the software product by an expe-

           FTAM DCL interface. The APPEND, COPY, DELETE, DIRECTORY, and
           RENAME commands are supported with a specific set of qual-
           ifiers in an open system environment.

           Support for Any File Naming Convention

           A file designation is system-specific information that iden-
           tifies a file to its storage system. VAX FTAM software lets
           users specify files using the naming conventions of the sys-
           tems where the files reside. It supports the standard RMS
           format for file specifications and a comparable style of file-
           specification format that accommodates non-RMS file desig-
           nations.

           Support for Several File Types

           VAX FTAM software can access and transfer files with both
           binary and ASCII data. FTAM-1, FTAM-2, FTAM-3, and NBS-9 doc-
           ument types are supported.

           FTAM-1 files are unstructured text files, FTAM-2 files are
           sequential text files, and FTAM-3 files are unstructured bi-
           nary files. The FTAM-1, FTAM-2, and FTAM-3 document types
           support the parameters described in Table 2.

           DECnet-VAX, Version 5.4 Extensions          SPD 29.03.00


           VAX FTAM software treats local files the same way that RMS
           and DECnet-VAX do. Therefore, users can perform operations
           such as create, access, read, and write on local files and
           on supported VMS file types, as defined in the VAX FTAM Use
           manual.

           DAP-FTAM Gateway

           VAX FTAM provides a gateway that allows users on a DECnet
           node, with access to the gateway node, to participate in an
           OSI network. The gateway uses the Data Access Protocol (DAP)
           messages from the connected nodes to establish and maintain
           a connection with the remote FTAM system.

           Recovery and Restart

           VAX FTAM software supports the error recovery procedures de-
           fined in ISO 8571. These procedures provide error recovery
           from certain errors that might occur during a file trans-
           fer operation. If the /JOURNAL qualifier is specified and
           recovery is supported by the peer application, checkpoints
           are created to maintain recovery information. If the error
           is recoverable, VAX FTAM attempts to recover and complete
           the file transfer.

           File Transfers

           The VAX FTAM copying facility transfers files between com-
           patible FTAM systems without modifying the source file. The
           facility can transfer files in either direction between the
           local system and a remote FTAM system. The copying facil-
           ity can also transfer files between two remote FTAM systems
           for a local VAX FTAM user. By specifying a full DECnet file
           specification as the FTAM file name, users on a remote FTAM
           system can access files on any DECnet node known to a VAX
           FTAM system.

           DECnet-VAX, Version 5.4 Extensions          SPD 29.03.00


           The VAX FTAM appending facility allows users to append one
           or more files to a single output file within or between FTAM
           systems.

           File Deletion

           The VAX FTAM deletion facility can delete one or more files
           on any combination of FTAM systems provided that the user
           has delete access to those files on the specific FTAM sys-
           tem.

           Renaming Requests

           The VAX FTAM renaming facility allows users to rename files.
           The facility works on files stored on local systems (local
           files) and on files stored on remote FTAM systems (remote
           files). The facility enables users to change the directory
           specification, file name, file type, or file version of an
           existing file. For remote files, users must specify what-
           ever type of information the remote FTAM system requires for
           specifying files.

           Directory Requests

           The VAX FTAM directory facility displays the subset of FTAM
           file attributes that are meaningful in a VMS environment:
           for example, date/time of last modification or file name.
           The facility works on files stored on local systems (local
           files) and on files stored on remote FTAM systems (remote
           files).

           Access Requests

           VAX FTAM provides LOCATE, ERASE, READ and INSERT inbound ac-
           cess services for files stored on local systems.

           Management and Problem Determination Tools

           VAX FTAM supplies a number of management tools, including
           an installation verification procedure (IVP), a control pro-
           gram, a tracing utility, and event logging.

           DECnet-VAX, Version 5.4 Extensions          SPD 29.03.00


           Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)

           The VAX FTAM IVP sets up outbound and inbound application
           associations. A connection is made to the local system (as
           a loopback test). The VAX FTAM IVP checks that the instal-
           lation is able to set up and release presentation and ses-
           sion connections. It tests the VAX FTAM software by creat-
           ing a file locally, reading the file's attributes, renam-
           ing the file, and then deleting the file. Each operation uses
           separate associations.

           Control Program (OSIF$CONTROL)

           The OSIFCP management commands allow users to configure and
           view the VAX FTAM databases. OSIF$CONTROL provides an on-
           line Help facility that summarizes each command and its pa-
           rameters. If a user makes a mistake when entering a command
           or if OSIF$CONTROL cannot respond to a command successfully,
           OSIF$CONTROL generates an error message.

           Tracing Utility

           The VAX FTAM tracing utility is a tool for identifying prob-
           lems in protocol exchanges between a local system and any
           remote FTAM system. The tracing utility captures protocol
           exchanges and transcribes them into easily read text.

           The VAX FTAM tracing utility monitors data exchanges for in-
           dividual associations. The tracing utility can trace data
           originating from the following components: FTAM (DATA, PRO-
           TOCOL, and STRUCTURING), ACSE, Presentation, and Session.

           Event Logging

           VAX FTAM sends event messages to the VMS OPCOM utility, which
           displays the messages on designated network operator's con-
           soles.

           Requirements for Compatibility with VAX FTAM

           The VAX FTAM software lets an open system perform a specific
           set of file transfer, access and management activities with
           any open system having a compatible FTAM implementation. To
           be compatible, different FTAM implementations must conform
           to a minimal set of the capabilities defined by the ISO stan-
           dards.

           Appendix: VAX OSI Applications Kernel, Version 2.0 for
           DECnet-VAX

           The VAX OSI Applications Kernel (OSAK) implements the pro-
           tocols for the OSI Session, Presentation, and Application
           (ACSE) layers.

           Supported Standards

           VAX OSAK conforms to the Protocol Specifications produced
           by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO),
           and the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative
           Committee (CCITT) recommendations.

           Relevant ISO service standards are also listed in this sec-
           tion, however OSAK V2.0 does not claim conformance to any
           service standards; they have been included only for complete-
           ness.

           Model. It provides services to establish and terminate con-
           nections (associations) between OSI applications across open
           networks.

           The ACSE implementation does not support the Authentication
           functional unit. The services offered include a Redirect ser-
           vice.

           The Presentation layer ensures the information content of
           data is preserved during its transfer across a connection.
           It provides services to establish and control the contexts
           used in the communication, where each context represents the
           intended interpretation of the data which is passed.

           The Presentation functional units supported are

              o  Kernel

              o  Context Management

           The Session layer provides services for controlling the di-
           alogue between cooperating applications. The OSI Session Ser-
           vice is dependent upon the services provided by the OSI Trans-
           port layer.

           The OSAK Session implementation supports Session V1 and Ses-
           sion V2 (unlimited user data) under constraint of the NIST
           agreements.

           OSAK conforms to ISO 8327 (as specified in Section 3 con-
           formance) as follows:

              .  Segmentation is not supported.

              .  Use of the transport expedited service is implemented.

              OSAK does not allow the use of a transport connection to
              be reused by a second or subsequent session connection.

           Management and Problem Determination Tools

           VAX OSAK provides a number of management tools, including
           an installation verification procedure (IVP), a control pro-
           gram, a tracing utility, and eve nt logging.

           Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)

           An IVP is provided to verify that OSAK has been installed
           successfully. The IVP may be run at any time after instal-
           lation.

           Control Program (OSAK$CONTROL)

           Utilities to manage configuration of parameters and event
           logging, and the examination of statistical information re-
           lating to the Session layer on the local system are provided.
           These utilities also provide on-line help.

           Tracing Utility

           Utilities are provided that allow for the tracing of pro-
           tocol exchanges for the upper layers (Session, Presentation,
           and Application). The protocol exchange is logged for sub-
           sequent analysis. Users can select which protocols are traced.
           The options are ACSE, Presentation, Session, Errors and trac-
           ing of user-data in "generic" ASN.1.

           Event Logging

           The Session layer provides logging of significant events to
           the VMS OPCOM utility, to assist in fault isolation.

                 ports a maximum TPDU size of 8192 octets for class 4.
                 When operating over a LAN, a TPDU size of 1024 octets
                 is used to ensure there is no segmenting of TPDUs in
                 the network layer. The maximum TPDU size supported for
                 Class 0 is 2048 octets.

           Appendix: VAX Packetnet System Interface (P.S.I. and
           P.S.I. Access), Version for DECnet-VAX

           DESCRIPTION

           VAX Packetnet System Interface

           VAX Packetnet System Interface (P.S.I.) allows suitably con-
           figured DECnet-VAX systems to connect to Packet Switching
           Data Networks (PSDNs) conforming to CCITT recommendation X.25
           (1978, 1980 or 1984) and/or to International Standards (ISO)
           7776 and 8208. VAX P.S.I. allows a DECnet-VAX system to func-
           tion as Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) or be addressed as Data
           Circuit Terminating Equipment (DCE) as follows:

           o  A packet-mode DTE connected to a supported PSDN conform-
              ing to CCITT Recommendation X.25 (1980, 1984)

           o  A packet-mode DTE connected to a CSMA/CD LAN conforming
              to ISO 8802-3 using ISO Logical Link Control Type 2 (LLC2)
              as specified in ISO 8881

           o  A packet-mode DTE/DCE connected to a DCE/DTE conforming
              to ISO 7776 and 8208

           VAX P.S.I. can be configured for either Native or Multi-host
           operation:

           o  VAX P.S.I. Native supports direct connections from a VAX
              system to one or more PSDNs, each of which may have one
              or more DTEs. VAX P.S.I. Native also allows communica-
              tion with any non-Digital X.25 system on the same LAN that
              supports the ISO Logical Link Control Type 2 (LLC2) pro-
              tocol.

           o  VAX P.S.I. Multi-host provides the features offered by
              VAX P.S.I. Native and also acts as an X.25 Connector sys-
              tem to provide a physical connection to a PSDN for any
              suitably configured X.25 Client system on the LAN.

           A VAX P.S.I. license is required to run VAX P.S.I. for DECnet-VAX.

           DECnet-VAX, Version 5.4 Extensions          SPD 29.03.00


           VAX Packetnet System Interface Access

           VAX Packetnet System Interface (P.S.I.) Access allows a suit-
           ably configured DECnet-VAX system to make logical connec-
           tions to Packet Switching Data Networks (PSDNs) by using one
           or more X.25 Connector systems. The Connector system pro-
           vides physical connection(s) to a PSDN(s) to enable process-
           to-process and terminal communications between the VAX P.S.I.
           Access system and the remote Data Terminal Equipment (DTE).

           The X.25 Connector system may be any of the following:

           o  An X25router 100/2000 (SPD 28.86.xx).

           o  A DEC X25gateway 100/500 (SPD 32.97.xx).

           o  VAX P.S.I. V4.3 configured in Multi-host mode (see SPD
              25.40.xx).

           o  VAX P.S.I. configured in Multi-host mode (as described
              in this SPD).

           DECnet logical links are established by VMS to connect the
           VAX P.S.I. Access system to the X.25 Connector system. These
           links may use any supported DECnet communications path be-
           tween the VAX P.S.I. Access system and the Connector sys-
           tem, provided they themselves do not use an X.25 connection.
           VAX P.S.I. Access uses these links to transmit X.25 or X.29
           messages between the Connector system and the VAX P.S.I. Ac-
           cess system.

           Note that successful use of an X.29 connection, either for
           incoming X.29 calls or by means of the host-based PAD util-
           ity supplied with VAX P.S.I. Access, depends on the DECnet
           circuit between the Access and Connector system having a low
           response time. This requires high-speed DECnet connections
           and few intermediate routing systems.

           DECnet-VAX, Version 5.4 Extensions          SPD 29.03.00


           A single VAX P.S.I. Access system can connect to one or more
           Connector systems concurrently, and hence access all PSDN(s)
           accessible from those Connector systems. When VAX P.S.I. Ac-
           cess is installed, one of these Connector systems/PSDN com-
           binations must be established as the default gateway for out-
           bound and inbound traffic.

           Features

           VAX P.S.I. and VAX P.S.I. Access can be used in the follow-
           ing ways:

           o  Process-to-process (X.25) communication

           o  Process-to-terminal (X.29) communication

           o  Terminal-to-Process (X.29) communication

           o  DECnet communications

           o  Open System Interconnection

           Process-to-process (X.25) Communication

           VAX P.S.I. and VAX P.S.I. Access provide access for VMS user
           programs written in VAX MACRO and high-level languages such
           as VAX FORTRAN. Programs executing in PDP-11 compatibility
           mode are not supported.

           The X.25 programming interface allows application programs
           to access the service interface to the packet level by means
           of the standard VMS QIO interface. Functions include the set-
           ting up and breaking of network connections, data transmis-
           sion and reception, sending and receiving of interrupt mes-
           sages, and resetting of virtual circuits The interface al-
           lows splitting and recombining of messages which are longer
           than the packet size selected for the circuit.

           The X.25 programmimg interface enables an application pro-
           gram using VMS System Services to communicate with comple-
           mentary software on other systems (Digital or non-Digital
           DTEs) accessible through the X.25 connection.

           Process-to-terminal and Terminal-to-process (X.29) Commu-
           nication

           VAX P.S.I. and VAX P.S.I. Access support terminal communi-
           cations according to CCITT recommendations X.3, X.28, and
           X.29 for:

           o  Outgoing terminal traffic

           P.S.I. host users may make outgoing calls to other Digital
           or non-Digital CPUs, or suitable network PADs accessible through
           a PSDN, using the X.29 programming interface or by using the
           host-based Packet Assembly/Disassembly (PAD). The PAD fa-
           cility accepts DCL-style commands or CCITT X.28 commands.

           o  Incoming terminal traffic

           The X.29 Interactive Terminal Interface allows remote asyn-
           chronous terminals (character-mode DTEs) connected to the
           network to communicate with the P.S.I. host in a manner sim-
           ilar to local terminals. Dissimilarities may appear as a re-
           sult of delays caused by the PSDN(s) and the various PAD pa-
           rameter settings chosen by the user or peculiar to the PSDN(s).
           In this case, the remote PAD must perform code conversions
           between ASCII and the code the terminal uses. Note that there
           may be some restrictions imposed by the PSDN(s).

           Terminal parameters defined in the X.3 recommendation are
           explicitly supported. Network-specific enhancements or ex-
           tensions to the X.3 parameters are available at both the X.29
           programming interface and the host-based PAD user interface.
           Terminal processes that depend on these extensions may cause
           problems when used on other PSDNs or when accessing one PSDN
           via another (for example, international access).

           The X.29 terminal interface is compatible with the local ter-
           minal interface, except for those facilities where the PSDN
           does not provide adequate support. The X.29 interface in-
           cludes support for specific X.29 signaling.


                                      31

 



           DECnet-VAX, Version 5.4 Extensions          SPD 29.03.00


           The host-based PAD employs a DCL-style command syntax, of-
           fering the ability to reference the CCITT PAD parameters sym-
           bolically, as well as an interface that conforms to the stan-
           dard CCITT command signals. The host-based PAD also offers
           the capability of running multiple X.29 sessions using the
           VMS SPAWN and ATTACH commands. The host-based PAD supports
           reception of reselection messages to allow X.29 calls to be
           redirected to another DTE.

           The X.29 programming interface is similar to the X.25 one
           and allows a VMS process to control the virtual circuit (for
           example, to modify PAD parameters or clear a call). The X.29
           programming interface can also be used to make an outgoing
           call to a remote PAD. The programming interface allows gen-
           eration of PAD reselection messages.

           The maximum number of terminals supported (both local and
           remote X.29) must not exceed the number supported by VMS.
           The use of PVCs for X.29 connections is not defined by the
           1980, 1984 and 1988 CCITT Recommendations and is not sup-
           ported.

           DECnet communication

           VAX P.S.I. allows the use of DECnet facilities over static
           X.25 circuits. In DECnet Phase IV, static X.25 circuits are
           called Data Link Mapping (DLM) circuits. In DECnet/OSI Phase
           V, these circuits are called Statically Assigned circuits.

           VAX P.S.I. and DECnet-VAX can be configured on a host sys-
           tem to provide DECnet communications over X.25 circuits as
           follows:

           o  As a DECnet Phase IV Level 1 or Level 2 router or a DEC-
              net Phase IV end node for communications with a Phase IV
              Level 1 or Level 2 router across statically assigned X.25
              circuits (DLM).

           DECnet-VAX, Version 5.4 Extensions          SPD 29.03.00


           o  As a DECnet Phase IV end node for communications with a
              Phase V Level 1 or Level 2 router across statically as-
              signed X.25 circuits (DLM).

           Open System Interconnection

           VAX P.S.I. and VAX P.S.I. Access can be used by VAX OSI Trans-
           port V3.0 (VOTS) to provide the Connection Oriented Network
           Service to allow mapping between a destination NSAP address
           and a destination DTE address according to ISO 8348.

           Virtual Circuits

           VAX P.S.I. (in Native or Multi-host mode) supports both Per-
           manent Virtual Circuits (PVCs) and Switched Virtual Circuits
           (SVCs). One virtual circuit is used for each:

           o  Incoming or outgoing X.29 terminal connection

           o  X.25 connection, using either a SVC or PVC

           VAX P.S.I. supports a maximum of 4096 incoming and outgo-
           ing virtual circuits subject to the following restrictions:

           o  Up to 1800 incoming virtual circuits per system

           o  Up to 2296 outgoing virtual circuits per system

           VAX P.S.I. Access supports a maximum of 900 incoming or out-
           going virtual circuits per system.

           Note that each virtual circuit requires a certain amount of
           memory so the number of logical virtual circuits possible
           on any single system will be limited by the available mem-
           ory.

           Configuration

           VAX P.S.I. and VAX P.S.I. Access provide a configuration pro-
           cedure to configure a VAX system. This menu-based interface
           allows network managers to create an initialization script

           DECnet-VAX, Version 5.4 Extensions          SPD 29.03.00


           to configure entities and their attributes after initial in-
           stallation.

           Network Management

           The Network Control Language (NCL) utility is used to man-
           age VAX P.S.I. and VAX P.S.I. Access. This utility is part
           of the DECnet-VAX Extensions kit and allows network managers:

           o  To define and maintain the configuration of systems in-
              teractively by setting up and changing entities and their
              attributes.

           o  To control the operation of systems interactively, for
              example by starting and stopping lines, turning DTEs on
              and off.

           o  To test the components of the network, for example to iso-
              late a defective component.

           Problem Solving

           The Common Trace Facility provided by DECnet-VAX Extensions
           is used for tracing VAX P.S.I. and VAX P.S.I. Access. It helps
           network managers solve problems with VAX P.S.I. and VAX P.S.I.
           Access by tracing and analyzing information at various stages
           as it passes between the VAX P.S.I. system and the PSDN. VAX
           P.S.I. and VAX P.S.I. Access also support the Phase V Event
           Dispatched Utility (EVD) to provide logging of significant

           P.S.I. Accounting

           The P.S.I. Accounting utility enables the system manager to
           obtain information PSDN usage. P.S.I. Accounting can extract
           the information collected and display the information di-
           rectly on a terminal or write the information to a file. In-
           formation can be extracted for selected records, or a sum-
           mary can be produced. The P.S.I. Accounting utility is com-
           patible with the VMS Accounting utility.

           In the case of incoming X.29 calls, no information about the
           process/account on to which a user is logged can be stored.
           However this information may be obtained by correlation with
           VMS accounting records.

           X.25 Security

           X.25 Security allows control of both remote DTE access to
           VAX P.S.I. and VAX P.S.I. Access, and access to the PSDN(s)
           by VMS processes. X.25 Security allows for access control
           on the basis of:

           o  The remote DTE numbers involved, either on the basis of
              individual DTE numbers or groups of DTE numbers with com-
              mon leading digits.

           o  The process making the outgoing call or the application
              handling the incoming call.

           In addition, when configured in Multi-host mode, VAX P.S.I.
           can apply security checks to both incoming calls to and out-
           going calls from any suitably configured X.25 Client sys-
           tem. Security on both the VAX P.S.I. and X.25 Client sys-
           tem is required for comprehensive protection.

           P.S.I. Mail

           The P.S.I. Mail utility allows communication via electronic
           mail between two VMS systems running VAX P.S.I. or VAX P.S.I.
           Access, using the VMS Mail facility even in the absence of
           any DECnet communications between the two DTEs. Refer to the
           VMS Operating System SPD 25.01.xx for more information about
           VMS Mail.

           Conformance to Standards

           VAX P.S.I. conforms to the following standards:

           o  CCITT Recommendation X.25 (1978, 1980, or 1984) using the
              LAPB or LAPBE variants of the X.25 packet level and data
              link protocols

           DECnet-VAX, Version 5.4 Extensions          SPD 29.03.00


           o  ISO 8208 - X.25 Packet Level Protocol for Data Terminal
              Equipment

           o  ISO 7776 - HDLC Procedures: X.25 LAPB-compatible DTE Data
              Link Procedures

           o  ISO 3309 - HDLC frame generation and structure[1]

           o  ISO 8881 - Use of X.25 Packet Level Protocol in Local Area
              networks (LLC2)

           Table 1 describes the particular aspects of the CCITT X.25
           recommendation supported by VAX P.S.I. Note that actual sup-
           port for any given feature depends on the PSDN used.

           Synchronous Communications Devices

           VAX P.S.I. supports the synchronous communications devices
           shown in the WAN Device Drivers Appendix. The devices are
           different in many respects, particularly in the amount of
           CPU used. For optimum performance, customers are recommended
           to use a DMA device. Configuration guidelines are provided
           in the existing VAX P.S.I. V4.3 Software Product Descrip-
           tion (SPD/SSA 25.40.xx)

           Line Interfaces

           The electrical line interface used for PSDN communications
           depends on the hardware device used. VAX P.S.I. provides only
           the electrical interface of a DTE rather than a DCE, and does
           not provide clock signals. An external clock source (for ex-
           ample, a modem) is therefore required.

           The range of supported synchronous communications devices
           covers V.24, V.35 and V.10, RS232, RS422 and RS423 inter-
           faces over point-to-point, 4-wire, synchronous, full-duplex
           lines at transmission rates up to 256K bits per second. Fur-
           ther information is in the WAN Device Driver appendix.

           Prerequisite Support

           For new PSDNs, the customer and Digital must jointly pre-
           pare a Network Profile and Customer Support Plan covering
           all the intended network systems, their usage of SVCs, PVCs,
           and other network facilities, and their support. Without this
           Network Profile and Customer Support Plan, Digital cannot
           support the network connections.

           Customer Responsibilities

           In some cases the PSDN supplier (or PTT) may impose restric-
           tions, limitations, or requirements on the proposed Digi-
           tal network configuration. The customer must ensure they un-
           derstand and adhere to these controls for each and every net-
           work.

                                      37

 



           DECnet-VAX, Version 5.4 Extensions          SPD 29.03.00


           Before installation of VAX P.S.I., the customer must:

           o  Install all required software and hardware, including ter-
              minals.

           o  Obtain, install and demonstrate that any modems and other
              equipment and facilities necessary to interface to Dig-
              ital's communication equipment are operational.

           o  Demonstrate equivalence of operation for modems other than
              Bell 208A, 208B, 209, 212A synchronous modems, or in Eu-
              rope PTT approved modems.

           o  Demonstrate that, where necessary, modems used meet the
              appropriate interface standards.

           o  Subscribe to the Open User Group and to at least two SVCs
              to be able to complete the installation checkout (this
              tests loops information from the VAX P.S.I. system to the
              PSDN and back to VAX P.S.I. system). Systems that use PVCs
              or Closed User Groups only, or where the PSDN does not
              support calls to the same DTE address, require specially
              negotiated arrangements for Digital installation of P.S.I..

           o  Make available for a reasonable period of time, as mu-
              tually agreed by Digital and the customer, all hardware,
              communication facilities and terminals that are to be used
              during installation.

           Delays caused by any failure to meet the responsibilities
           will be charged at the then prevailing rate for time and ma-
           terials. Supported Networks

           Digital has designed or adopted VAX P.S.I. to operate with
           equipment conforming to ISO 8208/7776, with certain private
           PSDNs that have been approved by Digital, and with public
           networks in Table 5. Profiles for these private and public
           PSDNs are included in VAX P.S.I. Connections to public net-
           works not shown in this table are not supported by Digital.

           The presence of a network/country combination in the table
           above shows Digital's commitment to support VAX P.S.I. when
           using that public X.25 service. It does not necessarily im-
           ply that network certification by the particular network-
           ing authority has been granted for all or any hardware de-
           vices supported by the VAX P.S.I. software. Please contact
           your local Digital office for up-to-date information regard-
           ing supported configurations and certification status.

           Optional Facility Support

           VAX P.S.I. support for any given CCITT X.25 facility depends
           on support for it in the appropriate supported PSDN. Gen-
           erally, VAX P.S.I. is designed to disallow use of facili-
           ties that the PSDN will not support. The following table is
           therefore to be interpreted as what VAX P.S.I. is capable
           of doing, rather than what it will do when used on any par-
           ticular PSDN. The product documentation describes specific
           facility availability for the supported public PSDNs.

           Please note that not all optional facilities are supported
           for use with VAX P.S.I. Mail and Data Link Mapping (DLM).

           1. This is not applicable to a DTE. VAX P.S.I. does not sup-
              port receiving a level 3 Reject packet, and will not gen-
              erate one.

           2. The individual DTEs must be assigned their own addresses
              in dependent of the hunt group address. VAX P.S.I. can
              then ignore the hunt group. Alternatively, each line on
              the same CPU can be configured as if it were connected
              to a separate PSDN, each with the same DTE address.

           3. VAX P.S.I. does not generate these statistics, but in-
              coming statistics supplied by the PSDN are available in
              the accounting records and at the programming interface.

           4. VAX P.S.I. does not support the following items of the
              CCITT X.25 recommendation:

              o  Multi-link protocol

              o  Use of the D-bit in outgoing packets.

           protocols.

           Hardware Devices

           o  The DSH32 (dual sync line) and DST32 (single sync line)
              are multi-function devices for Busless systems. The com-
              munications controllers support DMA support DMA trans-
              fers for bit oriented protocols and perform character trans-
              mission, reception, and framing in microcode.

           o  The DPV11-DA or DPV11-S (Q-bus) and DUP11 (UNIBUS) are
              character interrupt devices for datalink handling. CPU
              cycles are required for data link level protocol process-
              ing and for each character sent and received.

           o  The DSV11 (Q-bus) is a dual line synchronous communica-
              tions device for Q-bus systems. The DSV11 supports DMA
              transfers for bit and character oriented protocols. The
              communications controller performs character transmis-
              sion, reception and framing in microcode.

           DECnet-VAX, Version 5.4 Extensions          SPD 29.03.00


           o  The DMB32 (BI-bus) and DMF32 (UNIBUS) are multi-function
              devices which include a single DMA line. The communica-
              tions controllers perform character transmission, recep-
              tion, and framing in microcode.

           For the DMB32, rev.J is required for applications using HDLC,
           SDLC and GENBYTE protocols. In the case of the DMF32, only
           rev. J and later are supported for use with the HDLC pro-
           tocol, and rev. M is required for simultaneous operation of
           the printer port.

           o  The DSB32 (BI-bus) is a dual line synchronous communi-
              cations device for VAXBI systems. The DSB32 supports DMA
              transfers for bit and character oriented protocols. The
              communications controller performs character transmis-
              sion, reception, and framing in microcode.

           Notes:

           o  The DSH32 and DST32 are not supported on VAXstation 2000
              and VAXstation 3100 systems.

           o  The DMB32, DMF32 and DSH32 are multi-function devices.
              Only the Device Driver for the synchronous ports are in-
              cluded in the VAX WAN Device Drivers.

           o  The use of UNIBUS options on a VAXBI system with a UNIBUS
              Adapter is not supported unless specified in Table 8.

           o  The DMB32 must be revision J or later for applications
              using GENBYTE, HDLC or SDLC protocols.

           o  The DMF32 must be revision J or later for applications
              using HDLC protocol.

           The VAX WAN Device Drivers includes Device Drivers that are
           reserved for use by Digital software products as well as De-
           vice Drivers that offer a supported User ($QIO) interface.
           Table 8 lists the Device Driver characteristics. The table

           entries indicate the maximum permitted line speeds in kilo-
           bits/second for each of the line protocols supported by the
           individual drivers.

           The Device Drivers all support full duplex and half duplex
           operation, where appropriate to the protocol. DDCMP and SDLC
           Device drivers all support both point-to-point and multi-
           point tributary operation. `Bisync' refers to the IBMimplementation
           of bisynchronous protocol. The Genbyte protocol is a gen-
           eral byte-orientated protocol for use with User-written fram-
           ing routines.

           The maximum permitted line speed depends on the line inter-
           face standard used and must not exceed 19.2 Kbps for an RS232
           /V.24 standard interface. There may be additional line speed
           restrictions for other line interface standards, refer to
           the product descriptions for the synchronous interfaces for
           more information. The Digital communications layered prod-
           ucts may not necessarily support operation of the synchronous
           interface at the maximum speed supported by the device driver.
           Refer to the appropriate Software Product Description for
           the Digital communications layered product for precise de-
           tails of supported configurations.

           In all cases, the data throughput over the synchronous lines
           is dependent on the user applications and system environ-
           ment.

           The device drivers all support modem control signal oper-
           ation. Please refer to the product descriptions for the ap-
           propriate synchronous interface for details of the modem sig-
           nals supported by an individual device.

           Notes:

           o  Where two line speeds are shown, for example 256/64, the
              higher speed refers to single line operation of the de-
              vice while the lower speed refers to dual line operation
              of the device.

           o  The DMB32 (SIDRIVER) only supports a synchronous line speed
              of 19.2K bps if any asynchronous lines are in use. On BI
              machines and machines which use an XMI to VAXBI adapter,
              the maximum synchronous line speed is 38.4K bps.

           o  The DMF32 (XGDRIVER) is supported on a VAXBI system fit-
              ted with a DWBUA UNIBUS adapter for DDCMP and Genbyte pro-
              tocol use only.

           DECnet-VAX, Version 5.4 Extensions          SPD 29.03.00


           o  The DSH32 (ZSDRIVER) running the DDCMP protocol only sup-
              ports a single line at 9.6K bps on a MicroVAX 2000. Run-
              ning the Bisync protocol it only supports a single line
              at 4.8Kbps on a MicroVAX 2000.

           o  The DSV11 (SJDRIVER) and DSB32 (SIDRIVER) support the use
              of different protocols on each of the two lines of the
              device.

           o  The DUP11 (SEDRIVER for Bisync) is supported on a VAXBI
              system fitted with a DWBUA UNIBUS adapter for VAX 8200,
              VAX 8250, VAX 8300, VAX 8350, VAX 8500, VAX 8530, VAX 8550,
              VAX 8700 and VAX 8800 systems only.

           VAX WAN Device Drivers for DECnet-VAX also provides a pseudo
           driver (WANDRIVER) that provides a programming interface to
           the data link level for the LAPB, DEC-HDLC and DDCMP pro-
           tocols.
