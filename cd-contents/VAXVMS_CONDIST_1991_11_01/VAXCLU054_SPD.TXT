     PRODUCT NAME:  VAXcluster Software, Version 5.4     SPD 29.78.04

     DESCRIPTION

     VAXcluster Software is a VMS System Integrated Product (SIP).
     It provides a highly integrated VMS computing environment dis-
     tributed over multiple VAX and/or MicroVAX CPUs. This environ-
     ment is called a VAXcluster system.

     CPUs in a VAXcluster system can share processing, mass storage,
     and other resources under a single VMS security and management
     domain. Within this highly integrated environment, CPUs re-
     tain their independence because they use local, memory-resident
     copies of the VMS Operating System. Thus, clustered CPUs can
     boot and fail independently while benefiting from common re-
     sources.

     Applications running on one or more CPUs in a VAXcluster sys-
     tem access shared resources in a coordinated manner. VAXcluster
     Software components synchronize access to shared resources, pre-
     venting two or more processes from interfering with each other
     when updating data. This coordination ensures data integrity
     during multiple concurrent update transactions.

     Because resources are shared, VAXcluster systems offer higher
     availability than standalone CPUs. Properly configured VAXclus-
     ter systems can withstand the failure of various components. For
     example, when one CPU in a cluster fails, users can log on to
     another CPU to create a new process and continue working. Appli-
     cations can be designed to survive the failure of one or more
     CPUs or other components.

     All VAXcluster systems have the following software features in
     common:

     o  Shared mass storage - the VMS file system allows all CPUs
        in a VAXcluster system to share mass storage, whether the
        storage devices are connected to a Hierarchical Storage
        Controller (HSC) subsystem or to a CPU.

     o  Shared batch and print queues accessible to any CPU in the
        VAXcluster system. The VMS job controller manages clusterwide
        batch and print queues which can be accessed by any CPU.
        Batch Jobs submitted to clusterwide queues are routed to any
        available CPU so that the batch load is shared.

     o  VMS MSCP server load balancing - the first time the disk is
        mounted it is brought online to the least loaded server.

     o  All disks in the VAXcluster system can be made accessible to
        all CPUs.

     o  Process information and control are available clusterwide to
        application programs and system utilities.

     o  The automated configuration command procedure assists in
        adding and removing CPUs and in modifying their configuration
        characteristics.

     o  Dynamic Show Cluster Utility displays the status of cluster
        hardware components and cluster communication links.

     o  There are cluster-wide standard VMS system and security
        features.

     VAXcluster System Configurations

     VAXcluster Software supports combinations of the following
     interconnects:

     o  Computer Interconnect (CI)

     o  Ethernet

     o  Digital Small Storage Interconnect (DSSI)

     The optimal VAXcluster system for any computing environment
     is based on tradeoffs of cost, functionality, and performance.
     Performance is influenced by the following factors:

     o  Applications in use

     o  Number and model of CPUs

     o  Interconnects and adapter types

     o  Disk I/O capacity and access time

     o  Number of disks being served

     o  Interconnect utilization

     Definitions:

     In VAXcluster systems, some CPUs can perform specialized func-
     tions. The following terms are used to refer to those CPUs:

     o  A VAX CPU (Central Processing Unit) - This is an electronic
        unit that includes one or more processors and acts as a
        central controlling body.

     o  Disk server - A disk server is a VAX system that makes disks
        available to other systems in the VAXcluster system.

     o  Boot server - A boot server is a disk server that down-line
        loads the VMS Operating System to other cluster members over
        the Ethernet.

     o  Satellite - A satellite is a system that is booted over the
        Ethernet by a boot server. The satellite systems are listed
        in the HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS section.

     o  Local Area VAXcluster System - This is an Ethernet-based
        VAXcluster system.

     o  Mixed Interconnect VAXcluster System - This type of VAX-
        cluster system uses more than one type of interconnect for
        cluster communication.

     The following general configuration rules apply to VAXcluster
     systems:

     o  The maximum number of VAX CPUs supported in a VAXcluster
        system is 96. Up to 32 systems may be systems other than
        single user workstations.

     o  If the Ethernet is used for cluster communications in any
        VAXcluster system, all CPUs must be connected to the same
        Ethernet local area network. VAXcluster systems support
        one Ethernet adaptor per CPU; all cluster members must be
        reachable on the Ethernet via that adapter. The adaptor used
        by the VAXcluster software is not user selectable. CPUs may
        have other adapters for other uses.

     o  A star coupler is a common connection point for CI connected
        CPUs and HSC subsystems. A VAXcluster system may include
        multiple star couplers.

     o  The RA series disks may be dual pathed between pairs of HSC
        subsystems on the same star coupler or between a pair of lo-
        cal controllers. Such dual-pathing provides both enhanced
        data availability and failover capability. Failover occurs
        when one controller or cable malfunctions and breaks one
        path. When the path breaks, the device using that path auto-
        matically fails over to the other path. The failover process
        is transparent to applications. There cannot be dual porting
        between an HSC and a local adaptor.

     o  In Dual-Host DSSI configurations, both CPUs must be config-
        ured as VAXcluster members, and the Digital Storage Systems
        Interconnect (DSSI) must be connected to both CPUs using any
        combination of embedded adaptors or KFQSA adaptors. Both mem-
        bers of the dual host system must be connected to the same
        extended Local Area Network (LAN).

     o  CPUs may use the Ethernet for cluster communications and may
        concurrently use it for other network protocols that conform
        to the applicable Ethernet standards, such as Ethernet V2.0,
        IEEE 802.2 and IEEE 802.3.

     o  Ethernet bridges may be used to localize VAXcluster system
        traffic should the overall network traffic be of concern. It
        is possible for a VAXcluster system to exist on both sides
        of the bridge. However, a low-latency data path providing
        approximately 10 megabits per second throughput must link all
        clustered CPUs.

     o  A CI path is needed between any pair of the following CPUs in
        a VAXcluster system. An Ethernet only VAXcluster system may
        include a maximum of one of the following CPUs:

        -    VAX 6000-xxx

        -    VAX 85xx

        -    VAX 86xx

                                     5

        -    VAX 88xx

     Recommendations

     Digital recommends VAXcluster system configurations based on its
     experience with the VAXcluster Software Product. The customer
     should evaluate specific application dependencies and perfor-
     mance requirements to determine an appropriate configuration
     for the desired computing environment. The requirements and
     recommendations are applicable at the time of release, but may
     change over time. When planning a VAXcluster system, consider
     the following recommendations:

     o  While VAXcluster systems may include any number of system
        disks, performance and disk space should be considered in de-
        termining their number and location. It is important to rec-
        ognize that system management efforts increase in proportion
        to the number of system disks.

     o  VAXcluster systems can provide enhanced availability by
        utilizing redundant components.

     o  If possible, Local Area and mixed-interconnect VAXcluster
        systems should include multiple boot and disk servers to
        enhance availability. When a server fails in configurations
        that include multiple servers, satellite access to disks
        fails over to another server. Boot and disk servers should
        be the most powerful CPUs in the cluster and should use the
        highest-bandwidth Ethernet adapters available in the cluster.

     o  Dual-pathing of DSA disks between HSC subsystems or between
        local storage adapters enhances availability. In Local Area
        VAXcluster systems, DSA disks can be dual pathed between
        local storage adapters. RF-series disks can be accessed by
        both CPUs in Dual-Host configurations.

     o  The optional VMS Volume Shadowing System Integrated Product
        provides the following advantages:

        -  Increased data availability

        -  Enhanced read performance with multiple system and data
           disks

           For more information, refer to the VMS Volume Shadowing
           Software Product Description (SPD 27.29.xx.)

     o  A dual-host configuration is a pair of MicroVAX CPUs con-
        nected to the same Digital System Storage interconnect (DSSI)
        bus. For the MicroVAX 3500 and MicroVAX 3600, the console
        ROMS must be Revision Level V5.1

     o  Dual-Host configurations utilizing RF-series Integrated Stor-
        age Elements (ISEs) offer failover and increased availabil-
        ity:

        -  CPUs have concurrent access to any disk on the DSSI bus.

        -  An ISE single disk is accessed through two paths and can
           be served to all satellites by either CPU.

        -  If either CPU fails, satellites can access their disks
           through the remaining one.

     All VAXcluster system CPUs must have a minimum of 4 megabytes of
     physical memory.

     1    All systems utilizing a DEQNA must operate with software

          data checking enabled. Since AUTOGEN automatically sets
          the correct parameter, no system management intervention is
          required. The DEQNA is not supported in clusters of greater
          than 42 nodes. For improved performance, Digital recommends
          replacing DEQNA's with DELQA's. An upgrade program is
          currently available from Digital. For more information,
          contact your local sales office.

     OPTIONAL HARDWARE

     This section describes the Computer Interconnect Star Coupler
     Expander (CISCE) and Hierarchical Storage Controller (HSC)
     Subsystems.

     A Computer Interconnect Star Coupler Expander
     (CISCE) may be added to any Star Coupler in a CI-based or mixed-
     interconnect VAXcluster system to increase the total combined
     number of CI-connected CPUs and HSC subsystems to 32.

     HSC Subsystems

     VAXcluster systems may include HSC40, HSC50 and HSC70 intel-
     ligent mass storage controllers. These controllers offload
     disk management functions from host CPUs and provide several
     additional benefits:

        Increased I/O throughput
        Multiple-CPU access to storage
        Support for VMS Volume Shadowing Software

     The following rules apply for HSC subsystems:

     o  Each HSC40 supports a maximum of 3 channels for disks and/or
        tapes.

     o  Each HSC50 supports a maximum of 6 channels for disks and/or
        tapes.

     o  Each HSC70 supports a maximum of 8 channels for disks and/or
        tapes.

     o  Each disk channel supports a maximum of 4 disk drives and
        each tape channel supports a maximum of 4 tape subsystems
        (with 4 tape drives each). The VMS Operating System supports
        a maximum of 12 tape drives per HSC subsystem.

     o  TA-series tape drives may only be dual pathed between pairs
        of HSC subsystems with HSC microcode revision level V3.9
        or later. Tape drives may not be dual pathed between local
        adaptors.

     o  If disks or tapes are dual pathed between a pair of HSC
        subsystems, both HSC subsystems must be connected to the
        same Star Coupler.

     SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

     o  VMS Operating System

        V5.3 and V5.4 of the VMS Operating System may coexist in
        a VAXcluster with the replacement of an image on the V5.3
        system with one supplied with the V5.4 system. See the V5.4
        release notes for details.

        V5.3 and V5.4 of the VMS Operating System may coexist in a
        VAXcluster. However, only one version of VMS may exist on a
        specific system disk. During a rolling upgrade, a separate
        system disk is required for each version. However, Digital
        recommends that all VAX systems in a VAXcluster run the
        latest release of VMS.

     o  DECnet-VAX Software

        All VAXcluster CPUs require either an End Node or Full Func-
        tion DECnet-VAX license.

        Refer to the DECnet-VAX Software Product Description document
        (SPD 25.03.xx) for further information.
