     PRODUCT NAME:  VAX DATATRIEVE, Version 5.1          SPD 25.44.22

     DESCRIPTION

     VAX DATATRIEVE is a query and report system for the VMS Operat-
     ing System. It provides a uniform access method for data stored
     by RMS, VAX Rdb/VMS, and VAX DBMS files on VMS and data resid-
     ing in certain IBM[R] mainframe databases accessed through VIDA
     for DB2[TM]. Using VAX DATATRIEVE, a novice or experienced user
     can retrieve or modify data without considering the underlying
     storage method or physical location.

     Modes of Operation

     VAX DATATRIEVE presents information in several different for-
     mats. Information can be displayed using simple defaults or can
     be reported on through a more flexible report writer. Informa-
     tion can be displayed on a terminal or workstation, printed on
     a hard-copy device, or written to a file. Information can also
     be displayed with user-defined VAX FMS and VAX TDMS forms or
     presented graphically. Hard copy of the graphic display can be
     printed on a printer attached to the terminal. VAX DATATRIEVE
     also provides an efficient way to access information stored on
     other VAX or PDP-11 systems linked by DECnet.

     VAX DATATRIEVE can be used interactively to retrieve, modify,
     store, or delete data using a simple set of commands. Frequently
     used combinations of commands can be stored as named procedures
     and invoked by name. Programs written in other VAX languages
     can call VAX DATATRIEVE, allowing them to be independent of
     underlying data storage methods and physical location.

     A DECwindows interface to VAX DATATRIEVE is provided. This
     allows the user to perform a subset of the DATATRIEVE functions
     using menu bars, scroll bars, pop-up menus, pull-down menus, and
     buttons. Data Dictionary

     VAX DATATRIEVE is dictionary driven. Data descriptions are
     stored in and retrieved from VAX CDD/Plus. VAX DATATRIEVE
     includes commands to store, examine, modify, and delete def-
     initions in the dictionary and can use definitions stored by
     other VAX layered products, such as the VAX DBMS Data Definition
     Language (DDL) or VAX Rdb/VMS metadata definitions.

     VAX DATATRIEVE includes full support for DMU format dictionar-
     ies. It includes support for record and domain definitions in
     CDO format dictionaries, including the ability to access share-
     able fields. Relationship tracking is also supported for these
     entities.

     Protection

     Protection is handled by the VAX CDD/Plus. VAX DATATRIEVE can
     access data only through definitions in the VAX CDD/Plus. Lock-
     ing the definition prevents the user from accessing the data.
     Access control can be based on name and login account. Addi-
     tional control using the password or terminal class (local,
     remote, or dial-up) can be specified for DMU format dictionar-
     ies.

     Remote Data Access

     VAX DATATRIEVE provides access to data on remote VAX or PDP-11
     systems provided DATATRIEVE has been installed on the remote
     system. VAX DATATRIEVE uses the local data dictionary on the
     remote node and will divide processing between the host and the
     remote system to reduce the traffic over the Phase IV DECnet
     communications link.

     For the Nonprogrammer

     VAX DATATRIEVE provides the novice user with a tutorial mode
     called GUIDE Mode.

     VAX DATATRIEVE offers ADT (Application Design Tool) for the more
     experienced user who wants to define his own data structures.
     ADT takes the user step-by-step through the definition of a
     domain based on an RMS data file.

     If VAX DATATRIEVE is used on the same information by experienced
     and novice users, the novice user can use the full power of the
     language by invoking procedures designed by the more experienced
     user.

     For the Programmer

     VAX DATATRIEVE is a highly structured language that provides
     automatic access optimization, data type conversion, and data
     validation. Looping and control structures, such as IF THEN
     ELSE, BEGIN END, REPEAT, WHILE, CHOICE and FOR (each record) can
     be combined and nested to create complex, powerful commands.

     VAX DATATRIEVE responds to programming errors with clear, ex-
     plicit error messages. The user can issue an EDIT command to
     invoke a text editor with an erroneous statement as input text,
     correct the mistake, and resubmit the command. This editor can
     be either EDT, TPU, or VAX Language-Sensitive Editor (LSE), and
     is controlled by a user logical name assignment.

     Data Definition

     VAX DATATRIEVE stores the fixed attributes of each record in
     the record definition. In addition to COBOL-like attributes,
     DATATRIEVE allows validation criteria, fields whose values are
     computed at run-time, missing value expressions, and default
     values.

     VAX DATATRIEVE supports most data types used by VAX FORTRAN,
     VAX COBOL, VAX PL/I, VAX C, and VAX BASIC. VAX DATATRIEVE also
     supports Varying String and Segmented String data types in VAX
     Rdb/VMS databases.

     Views

     A VIEW is an alternative description of data. It can be used to
     allow a user access to a subset of the data items in a record.
     It can restrict a user by including only some of the data items
     in a record, or it can combine data items from several files.
     Information can be linked through common values (or set linkages
     in VAX DBMS) to produce complex hierarchical structures. Using a
     predefined VIEW, a user can access and display data from several
     files at once with the same commands used on a single file. Data
     accessed through a VIEW can be printed and modified, but data
     cannot be stored or erased using a VIEW.

     Program Access

     VAX DATATRIEVE can be called from any language that supports the
     VMS calling standard. VAX DATATRIEVE automatically converts data
     from its storage format to the format expected by the program.
     All of the features of interactive VAX DATATRIEVE are available
     through the call interface and use the same syntax.

     Storage Methods

     VAX DATATRIEVE uses a single, consistent syntax to provide full
     access to information stored in VAX RMS sequential or indexed
     files (VAX RMS relative files are supported for queries only),
     VAX DBMS, and VAX Rdb/VMS databases. VAX DATATRIEVE can also
     provide read-only access to information stored in certain IBM
     mainframe databases through the use of VIDA for DB2. Data from
     all these sources can be combined into a single VIEW.

     If access to a VAX DBMS database involves explicit set walking,
     or if records must be manually connected or disconnected from
     sets, the user can employ VAX DATATRIEVE language features
     that are specific to VAX DBMS access. However, if the user
     employs VIEWS or implicit set walking, VAX DATATRIEVE can access
     information in VAX DBMS databases using the same syntax used for
     data from an RMS file.

     The VAX DATATRIEVE REPORT statement can produce simple formatted
     reports without formatting statements. It also allows the user
     to override its default format when more complex reports are
     required. A title, column headers, and page numbers are produced
     automatically. Simple statements (AT TOP, AT BOTTOM) create page
     headers and trailers for control breaks, or a report summary.
     VAX DATATRIEVE provides all of its statistical functions and
     value expressions within the REPORT statement. Reports can be
     generated from data stored in VAX RMS files, VAX DBMS and VAX
     Rdb/VMS databases, certain IBM mainframe databases accessed
     through the use of VIDA for DB2 or DATATRIEVE VIEWS that combine
     any of these without any change in the syntax of the REPORT
     statement.

     Graphics

     VAX DATATRIEVE includes a number of predefined plots invoked
     with a single command that takes standard record selection ex-
     pressions as arguments and creates bar, pie, line, and scattered
     point plots of the information selected. Plots can be displayed
     on Digital Equipment Corporation Graphics terminals such as
     the VT340 (refer to the OPTIONAL HARDWARE section for a list of
     specific supported terminals). Hard copy can be obtained from
     terminals by attaching a Digital device which supports the SIXEL
     protocol (for example, LA50, LA75). For users with DECwindows,
     graphics can be displayed in DECterm windows.

     Compatibility

     VAX DATATRIEVE is largely upward compatible from DATATRIEVE-11.
     A utility is provided with DATATRIEVE-11 to extract the contents
     of a DATATRIEVE-11 dictionary in a format to be entered into the
     VAX CDD/Plus. Some syntactic and semantic differences do exist
     between DATATRIEVE-11 and VAX DATATRIEVE. Procedures copied with
     the EXTRACT utility can require modification.
