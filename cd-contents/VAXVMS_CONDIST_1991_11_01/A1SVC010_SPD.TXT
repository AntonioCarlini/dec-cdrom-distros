          PRODUCT NAME:  ALL-IN-1 PC Server for VMS, Version 1.0       SPD
          31.71.00

          DESCRIPTION

          The ALL-IN-1 PC Server for VMS is a collection of executable
          images, DCL command procedures, ALL-IN-1 scripts, and data
          files. It allows an ALL-IN-1 system to be used as a server for
          the various PC Clients.

          The PC user has the ability to run ALL-IN-1 applications di-
          rectly through terminal emulation or let the PC control mail and
          file movement. In terminal emulation, the ALL-IN-1 PC Server for
          VMS recognizes the session as an interactive session.

          The All-IN-1 PC Server for VMS also has a simple user inter-
          face available to the VMS and/or ALL-IN-1 system manager for
          management functions. It provides the following services:

          o  Mail sorting and routing

          o  Scheduling

          o  User management

          o  Access to the ALL-IN-1 file cabinet and printers

          The ALL-IN-1 DESKtop for PCs family of products includes:

          o  ALL-IN-1 DESKtop for DOS (SPD 50.20.xx) - Required software
             for the PCs to use the facilities provided by ALL-IN-1 PC
             Server for VMS.

          o  ALL-IN-1 PC Server for VMS - Software that provides the
             connection between the various ALL-IN-1 personal computers
             and ALL-IN-1 on the VAX.




          Features

          o  Mail Sorting and Routing - The ALL-IN-1 PC Server for VMS
             monitors the PC user's inbound mail area for the appear-
             ance of new mail and alerts the PC of the availability of
             the mailbag, if the mailbag watch is active. The PC user can
             activate the server, by means of a menu selection on the per-
             sonal computer, to carry out a mail exchange (send/receive).
             This mail exchange is accomplished using the following ap-
             propriate transfer protocols available for connecting the
             PC and the VAX: Kermit (included in the product), DECnet, or
             MS-NET[TM] copy.

             During mail exchange, proper safeguards are maintained to
             avoid collisions with the mail reading/writing process. The
             server can keep a log of all Mailbag exchanges.

             The minimum required connection time for a mail exchange is
             the amount of time required to move the available mailbags to
             and from the PC.

          o  Reading/Writing Mail - The ALL-IN-1 PC Server for VMS reads
             and writes mail for registered users. The read/write process
             starts with an un-bagging and sorting operation. Messages can
             include ALL-IN-1 mail messages or messages destined for Mes-
             sage Based Applications (MBA). Note: All mail is stored and
             forwarded through ALL-IN-1. Conversions of documents using a
             conversion product (e.g. KEYpaK[TM] can be accomplished when
             sending or receiving mail.)

             The mail write process interprets all mailbag information
             pertaining to priority, read receipt, addressees, subject
             and so forth, and creates an appropriate ALL-IN-1 message.
             Addressees are checked for acceptability; any addressee not
             acceptable is not used and a rejection message is returned to
             the personal computer.


             When messages are read, the mail header and body are text,
             and attachments are inspected to determine their convertibil-
             ity. The destination format of the attachment is the format
             indicated by the recipient as their preferred format. Read
             messages are collected with messages from other sources (such
             as Message Based Applications) into a new or existing mailbag
             and held until the next mailbag exchange is initiated.

          o  Scheduling - Scheduling is provided by a batch process known
             as the master scheduler which detects the presence of mail
             waiting to be delivered to or from a registered PC user. If
             the pre-set minimum time since the last mail delivery has ex-
             pired, a batch job is submitted in the user's name to handle
             the process known as read/write. The scheduler is submitted
             and managed by the VMS or ALL-IN-1 system manager who can
             submit the read/write process in the name of each user. The
             read/write process is performed in batch or detached mode
             with no delay or wait by the user.

             The read/write process bundles the mail addressed to the PC
             user into a mailbag for delivery. It checks for a mailbag
             from the PC user, breaks the mailbag and sends each arti-
             cle in the mailbag to its destination (ALL-IN-1 or the MBA
             processor).

             If the PC is logged into the VAX, it can request the Server
             to start monitor mode to check, at short intervals, for a new
             inbound mailbag for that PC. When a new mailbag is detected,
             a "trigger phrase" is transmitted to the PC. The trigger
             phrase causes the PC to start a pickup of the mailbag if
             the PC is not running another PC application. If the PC is
             running another PC application, the scheduler posts a notice
             to the user that a mailbag is available for pickup at the
             user's convenience.


          o  User Management - This is accomplished by means of a menu
             driven interface for the creation and maintenance of user
             lists, validation lists, broadcasting of messages to the
             PC user base, delivery of software updates to PC users, and
             installation testing. This runs from the VMS system manager's
             or ALL-IN-1 manager's account.

          o  Access to ALL-IN-1 file cabinet and printers - File transfers
             are available in the following combinations:

             DOS to/from VMS
             DOS to/from ALL-IN-1 File Cabinet
             DOS to ALL-IN-1 Printer
             PC File Cabinet to/from VMS
