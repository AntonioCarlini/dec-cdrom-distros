     PRODUCT NAME:  CDA Converter Library for VMS, Version 1.1    SPD
     31.31.01

     DESCRIPTION

     The CDA Converter Library allows users of document and table
     data files to convert to and from a variety of other standard
     document and table file formats. The CDA Converter Library
     adds a broader set of supported formats to the file conversion
     facility that is a part of VMS with VMS DECwindows.

     The CDA Converter Library for VMS supports both DECwindows
     workstations and timesharing systems with the DECwindows Compute
     Server installed. The user interface provided by DCL and by
     DECwindows application programs such as DECwrite or DECdecision
     remains the same, except that more formats are available.

     The supported formats are:

     o  Document Converters (each of these is bi-directional)

        -  AFS - Alternate Format Syntax - for use with ASCII Editors

        -  DCA - IBM[R] PC Word Processing Std., text

        -  DX - DEC WPS-PLUS and word processors

        -  SGML - ISO Standard markup language

     o  Table Data Converters

        -  WK1 - Lotus 1-2-3[R] V2, bi-directional

        -  DIF - Industry Std. Data Interchange Format, read-only

        -  CALCGRD - DECalc V3.0A Binary Grid files, read-only

     Restrictions

     The converters in the CDA Converter Library do not perform
     modality conversions such as converting a text file into an
     image or the reverse. Converters that support compound formats,
     such as DDIF, do process the text, graphics and images in the
     input data, but the output format specified by the user limits
     the conversion process. If the user takes a DDIF document and
     converts it to ASCII text, any non-text elements will be lost
     because they cannot be represented in the ASCII format. For
     cases where it is desirable to edit a compound document using
     an ASCII editor, the bi-directional AFS format converter may be
     used. The text file produced by the AFS converter contains tag
     references to temporary files where the non-text data is stored
     until the document is re-converted to a compound format.
