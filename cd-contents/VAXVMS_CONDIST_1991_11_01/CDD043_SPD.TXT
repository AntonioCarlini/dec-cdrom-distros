     PRODUCT NAME:  VAX CDD/Plus, Version 4.3            SPD 25.53.19

     DESCRIPTION

     The VAX CDD/Plus is an active, distributed repository system
     that provides a single logical repository for data definitions
     (metadata) and descriptions shared by VAX languages, tools and
     information management products.

     VAX CDD/Plus provides a way to define and track metadata that is
     to be used by more than one product and provides a mechanism for
     sharing, relating and reporting on the dictionary contents.

     The metadata in CDD/Plus keeps track of location, type, format,
     size, change history, and usage of the actual data (which is
     stored and maintained outside the data dictionary). All changes
     to the metadata are controlled by the repository system. This
     can provide better control of the application development and
     repository administration processes.

     With VAX CDD/Plus, repository users can:

     o  Allow the sharing of field, record and other data definitions
        among various VAX languages and VAX information management
        products

     o  Access definitions in multiple repositories (including those
        on other nodes.)

     o  Control the use of redundant and inconsistent definitions

     o  Protect the repository against unauthorized access

     o  Continue to use existing definitions set up with previous
        versions of VAX CDD

     Utilities

     VAX CDD/Plus supports metadata in two formats: metadata that
     users manipulate with the Common Dictionary Operator (CDO) and
     metadata that users manipulate with the Dictionary Management
     Utility (DMU).

     Common Dictionary Operator (CDO)

     The CDO Utility is the primary user interface to VAX CDD/Plus,
     where users can accomplish all of the data description, admin-
     istration, and repository management functions. The CDO Utility
     supports the VMS style of command entry. A flexible menu-driven
     editor allows users to create new field and record definitions,
     create new versions of previous definitions and browse through
     the current definitions.

     VAX CDD/Plus repositories created in CDO can store not only def-
     initions, but also information about how the definitions are re-
     lated. A CDO repository is created on a system when VAX CDD/Plus
     is first installed. Users can also read DMU dictionaries from
     CDO.

     Dictionary Management Utility (DMU)

     The DMU Utility allows the user to create and maintain existing
     dictionaries established with previous versions of VAX CDD. VAX
     CDD/Plus continues to support DMU dictionaries and the utilities
     that manipulate DMU dictionary definitions (CDDV and CDDL). If
     a DMU dictionary does not already exist on a system, CDD/Plus
     creates one during the installation procedure. Users manipulate
     DMU dictionary definitions through the DMU utility. Users can
     also read DMU definitions through CDO.

     o  CDDV - The Verify/Fix Utility (CDDV) is supplied to validate
        or repair DMU dictionary files.

     o  CDDL - The Data Definition Language Utility (CDDL) provides
        users with a mechanism for entering DMU dictionary record
        definitions directly. A text editor is used to create a CDDL
        source file containing record definitions and then the CDDL
        compiler is invoked to insert the record definition into the
        DMU dictionary.

     Features

     The following major features are utilized by only CDO (V4.x)
     repositories. VMS information management products that provide
     full support for CDO repositories are also able to utilize the
     capabilities associated with those repositories.

     Distributed Dictionary Implementation

     VAX CDD/Plus provides distributed access to CDO repository defi-
     nitions and directories. Through CDO, users can access metadata
     in CDO repositories on different devices on a single node, on
     different nodes in a VAXcluster, and on nodes connected by a
     local or wide area network. Repositories can be organized ac-
     cording to the needs of a corporation and definitions can either
     be managed centrally or locally. Within the CDO interface, users
     can switch from one physical repository to another and gain
     access to definitions in any of the repositories the user has
     access to.

     Field-Level Data Descriptions

     A field definition is the smallest unit of metadata that can be
     created and accessed in the repository. Field definitions can be
     simple data structures or complex subscripted structures. They
     can be combined to form various record definitions and can be
     accessed individually from several of the VAX layered products.
     Users need store only one copy of a particular definition that
     is used by various sources.

     Relationships

     Relationships are created by VAX CDD/Plus when users connect
     two CDO definitions in some way. For example, users can base
     the definition of a new field on an existing field definition in
     a CDO repository. Similarly, users can relate a group of field
     definitions in a record definition by including the field names
     in the record definition. Users do not need to define these
     relationships - CDO automatically creates them when users create
     field and record definitions in CDO.

     Usage Tracking

     VAX CDD/Plus keeps track of all CDO repository usage. Therefore,
     users can find out which other repository definitions make use
     of a particular field definition. When users want to change
     a field definition, they can confirm which definitions may

                                     4

     be affected by the change and which definitions need to be
     redefined before using the changed field definition.

     Users can control changes to definitions in two ways: they
     can change the original definition to take effect immediately
     (change-in-place), or they can create a new version and allow
     other users to incorporate it over time. (DEFINE) Messages can
     warn users when a new version of repository definitions exists
     or when inconsistencies may exist between the repository and
     external copies.

     Data Security and Integrity

     VAX CDD/Plus provides the data administrator with the tools
     to grant or deny access rights to repository definitions. The
     VAX CDD/Plus protection provisions for CDO definitions are
     consistent with VMS protection schemes. Also, VAX CDD/Plus
     provides journaling capabilities that automatically protect
     repository sessions from system failures.

     Call Interface

     System programmer, software engineers, and experienced applica-
     tion designers can make direct calls to the VAX CDD/Plus entry
     points from user programs. Using the call interface allows these
     users to directly access CDO repositories without using the CDO
     utility. The call interface is documented in the VAX CDD/Plus
     Call Interface Manual.
