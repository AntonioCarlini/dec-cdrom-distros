          PRODUCT NAME:  VMS/ULTRIX Connection, Version 1.3   SPD 25.A4.03

          DESCRIPTION

          The VMS/ULTRIX Connection[TM] is a VMS layered software product
          that promotes interoperability and resource sharing between VMS
          systems and UNIX[R] systems.

          The VMS/ULTRIX Connection supports networking, file access,
          remote terminal access, and application development between VMS
          systems and UNIX systems. The VMS/ULTRIX Connection includes
          three major components:

          o  An ARPANET communication system

          o  A Network File System (NFS server)

          o  DEC Remote Procedure Call (DECrpc) for VMS V1.0

          The product also includes a system management interface for set-
          ting up and monitoring the communication and NFS environments.

          New Features

          DEC Remote Procedure Call (DECrpc) for VMS V1.0

          DECrpc V1.0 is based on Hewlett-Packard/Apollo's Network Comput-
          ing System (NCS) Remote Procedure Call (RPC) facility. DECrpc
          allows application developers to partition their applications
          along subroutine interfaces and to have those subroutines exe-
          cute on remote hosts. It provides a transport independent inter-
          face to applications using the Internet UDP/IP protocols. DECrpc
          includes the following set of components:

          o  Remote Procedure Call (RPC) run-time library

          o  Network Interface Definition Language (NIDL) compiler

                                       DIGITAL                 August 1990

          o  Local and Global Location Brokers

          DECrpc does not include other components of the Network Comput-
          ing Architecture such as the Concurrent Programming Support or
          the replicated Global Location Broker.

          RPC Applications are written in a high level language, NIDL,
          which in turn generates calls to the RPC run-time procedures.
          The stub files generated by the NIDL compiler are C source
          files. Digital has extended the RPC run-time library to provide
          support for a name service independent interface.

          DECrpc has been tested and found compatible with the HP/Apollo's
          NCS V1.5 product.

          Routing Information Protocol (RIP)

          Previous releases of the VMS/ULTRIX Connection required network
          and host routes to be entered manually. RIP will allow hosts
          running the VMS/ULTRIX Connection to discover this networking
          information dynamically among machines on their local network.

          Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) Resolver

          The BIND service is a host name and address lookup service
          for the Internet network. It allows client systems to obtain
          host names and addresses from BIND servers rather than from
          locally hosted databases. The client portion of the Internet
          naming protocols (BIND Resolver) is implemented in V1.3 of the
          VMS/ULTRIX Connection.

          ARPANET Communication System

          The VMS/ULTRIX Connection supports industry standard networking
          on VMS through a set of ARPANET protocols. The supported proto-
          cols are based on the 4.3 Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD)
          and include:

          o  Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

          o  Internet Protocol (IP)

          VMS/ULTRIX Connection, Version 1.3                  SPD 25.A4.03



          o  Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)

          o  Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

          o  User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

          o  File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

          o  Telnet Protocol

          o  Routing Information Protocol (RIP)

          o  Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND)

          C Language applications may be written using the Berkeley Socket
          Programming interface when this product is used with VMS Operat-
          ing System.

          The VMS/ULTRIX Connection also supports a QIO programming inter-
          face so users can write applications to access the lower-level
          protocols. Users can write networking applications in any VAX
          language using the standard VMS ASSIGN, DASSGN, and QIO system
          services.

          The VMS/ULTRIX Connection supports bi-directional file transfer
          sessions between the VMS server and the UNIX client. The FTP
          session allows the client to view the file system structure on
          the remote server.

          The VMS/ULTRIX Connection supports Telnet client and server ap-
          plications. Telnet is the standard Internet Application Protocol
          for remote login. An RLOGIN server application is also provided.

          Note:   Version 1.3 of the VMS/ULTRIX Connection will NOT sup-
                  port SMTP, or the full set of ULTRIX "r" commands such
                  as rcp and rsh.

          VMS/ULTRIX Connection, Version 1.3                  SPD 25.A4.03



          The VMS/ULTRIX Connection supports NFS, Version 2.0 protocol
          specifications. NFS is an application layer protocol that
          provides clients with transparent access to remote file ser-
          vices. Version 1.3 of the VMS/ULTRIX Connection provides an NFS
          server on VMS for UNIX clients. Version 1.3 does not support VMS
          clients.

          The NFS server promotes data sharing among clients by providing
          a central data storage facility for VMS and UNIX files. The NFS
          server provides two types of file access for UNIX clients:

          o  Client access to VMS files

          o  Client access to ULTRIX-compatible files

          Client Access to VMS Files

          UNIX clients can access VMS files stored in an RMS StreamLF for-
          mat on the server. StreamLF files are analogous to the "byte"
          stream files common on UNIX systems. Clients can access other
          types of RMS files, such as ISAM files. However, the ISAM struc-
          ture and file contents will be passed to the UNIX client in
          sequential bytes. A programmer would have to be aware of the
          specific ISAM structure to make use of the file contents on the
          UNIX client.

          Client access to the VMS file system is subject to standard
          VMS file conventions. These conventions include 8 levels of
          directory nesting, and filenames with the following syntax:

          File Name      File Type      File Version Number

          39 Charac-     39 Charac-     INTEGER
          ters.          ters.

          Permitted characters are A-Z, a-z, 0-9, underscore (_), hyphen
          (-), and dollar sign ($). All alphabetic characters are inter-
          preted as uppercase characters. Filename and type cannot begin
          with an underscore, hyphen, or dollar sign. Version numbers must
          be decimal numbers in the range 1 to 32767. You can refer to a

          version number in a relative manner by specifying a zero or a
          negative number. Specifying zero locates the most recent ver-
          sion of the file, and specifying -1 locates the next most recent
          version.

          Client Access to ULTRIX-Compatible Files

          The ULTRIX-compatible file system on VMS provides clients with
          the same file system functionality as an ULTRIX server. To the
          remote client, the VMS NFS server looks like a large ULTRIX file
          cabinet. The ULTRIX files are accessed according to the rules
          of the ULTRIX File System (UFS). UFS supports 4.3BSD Fast File
          System semantics, which are a superset of the SVID (System V
          Interface Definition) Issue 2, Volume 1, file system semantics.
          The UFS rules permit up to 255 levels of directory nesting and
          filenames of 255 characters. The ULTRIX-compatible file system
          on VMS may also be accessed by applications executing on the VAX
          system.

          Note:   Version 1.3 of the VMS/ULTRIX Connection does not sup-
                  port programmer access to the NFS Remote Procedure Call
                  (RPC) and External Data Representation (XDR) mechanism.

          Automount

          Support for automount has been added to V1.3 of the VMS/ULTRIX
          Connection. The automount command transparently mounts and
          unmounts NFS file systems on an as-needed basis. It is useful
          for mounting file systems and directories that are needed only
          occasionally.

          System Management

          The VMS/ULTRIX Connection provides DCL commands to control and
          monitor the communication and NFS subsystems. Commands are
          provided to define hosts, startup/shutdown/monitor network
          interfaces, and control how/what workstation clients access
          files on the VMS system.
