PRODUCT NAME: VAX CoProcessor/RSX, Version 1.0		SPD 29.79.00


DESCRIPTION

Overview

VAX CoProcessor/RSX (CP/RSX) is a combined VMS software layered product
and a PDP-11 operating system product.  VAX CoProcessor/RSX provides users
with an RSX-11 development and run-time environment on their VMS system.
VAX CoProcessor/RSX also allows for the migration of many existing RSX
applications to VMS. 

VAX CoProcessor/RSX is especially suited to customers who want to gradually
rewrite their RSX applications into VMS native code.  VAX CoProcessor/RSX
helps customers with this transition by allowing them to continue to run
their RSX applications, under the VAX CoProcessor/RSX operating system, in
the same system configuration where they are running the applications that
have been re-written into VMS native code. 

VAX CoProcessor/RSX employs the KXJ11 board which contains a J11 PDP-11
processor, and communicates  over the Q-bus with a MicroVAX or VAXstation.

VAX CoProcessor/RSX creates an integrated coprocessing environment based on
Micro/RSX V4.1, with full access to VMS software tools. 




Features

System to System Communication

Tasks running on the KXJ11 board can communicate with tasks running on
the MicroVAX system by using QIO routines.  The VAX CoProcessor/RSX task
assigns a Logical Unit Number (LUN) to a VMS Mailbox, and then performs
QIOs to that Mailbox. 

General Access

Users may gain access to VAX CoProcessor/RSX through two different command
interfaces (also called command line interpreters, or CLIs): the VMS DCL
command line interpreter and the VAX CoProcessor/RSX command line interpreter.

When a user is logged onto VAX CoProcessor/RSX and using its CLI, all RSX
commands that the user types are directed to the RSX system where they are
in turn processed by the RSX CLI (MCR, DCL, or a user-written CLI)
specified in the user's RSX account logon information. Users may access VMS
facilities from the RSX environment by using the RSX ``VMS'' command as a
prefix to any VMS DCL command. Some facilities of VMS DCL (such as symbol
substitution and lexical functions) are not supported by VAX
CoProcessor/RSX. 

Alternatively, users logged onto the VMS system may want to use the VMS DCL
CLI and only occasionally issue an RSX command for the VAX CoProcessor/RSX
system.  The VMS DCL ``CPRSX'' command is available to issue one-line RSX 
commands to the VAX CoProcessor/RSX system. Most RSX utilities can be 
initiated in the same way. 

Operations With Disk and Tape Volumes

The peripheral devices connected to the Q-bus of the MicroVAX are
controlled by the MicroVAX and are not directly accessable by the KXJ11, or
by programs and applications executing on the KXJ11. The VAX
CoProcessor/RSX software emulates the PDP-11 I/O environment and provides
access to these devices via the MicroVAX.  I/O requests made by programs
running on the coprocessor are processed by psuedo device drivers, which
send the requests to cooperating software on the MicroVAX for execution.
Exceptions to this mode of I/O processing may be made by user-written
drivers that access the on-board I/O interfaces of the KXJ11. (These
interfaces are independent of the Q-bus.) 

Compatability


Compatibility with Other Derivatives of RSX

VAX CoProcessor/RSX is compatible at the program level with RSX-11M-PLUS
and Micro/RSX, and with RSX-11M and RSX-11S which are subsets of
RSX-11M-PLUS.  Features supported by VAX CoProcessor/RSX include: 

   ^ Separate Instruction and Data (I&D) space 

   ^ Extended Logical Names

   ^ Supervisor Mode Libraries

   ^ Record Management Services (RMS)

   ^ File Control Services (FCS)

   ^ Program Logical Address Space directives (PLAS)

   ^ Fast Mapping

   ^ Parent-offspring Tasking

   ^ Virtual Terminals

   ^ User-written Command Line Interpreters (CLIs)

Limitations

Every effort has been made to make the functions that this product supports
as compatible as possible with the Micro/RSX V4.1 (SPD 14.28.05)
environment given the constraints of the VMS Operating System environment.
However, a few areas of incompatibility do exist in this product and may
continue to exist in future versions.  The areas of incompatibility
mentioned in this Software Product Description are not guaranteed to be all
inclusive. 


The following RSX-11M-PLUS utilities are specifically NOT supported:

Queue Manager (QMG)
Line Printer Processor (LPP)
Error Logging (ERRLOG)

However, these functions are provided by corresponding features in VMS.

Restrictions and Non-uses

VAX CoProcessor/RSX supports only  one KXJ11-based VAX CoProcessor/RSX
operating system per MicroVAX system.  

VAX CoProcessor/RSX does not include drivers to support the on-board I/O 
capabilities of the KXJ11.  However, VAX CoProcessor/RSX supports the
addition of user-written drivers to the RSX environment through the same
loadable driver mechanism that is used in RSX-11M-PLUS and Micro/RSX.
The user can write drivers for the KXJ11's I/O interfaces. Because of the
limited nature of I/O connections to the KXJ11, it is unlikely that
existing applications that rely on add-on or custom hardware can be moved
from the RSX environment to the VAX CoProcessor/RSX environment. 

Such applications can be moved if the device communicates with the
VMS system by means of a VMS driver and if the device is of a class which VAX 
CoProcessor/RSX supports by transporting requests to the VMS host.  
VAX CoProcessor/RSX supports the following classes of devices:

^ Disks
^ Tapes
^ Terminals
^ Line printers
^ Card readers
^ Mailboxes


No Ancillary Control Processors (ACPs) for local disks are provided, 
because there are no local disks supported on the KXJ11.  VAX
CoProcessor/RSX supports ODS-I and ODS-II file structures on VMS. 
	
Applications using Network Facilities (DECnet access through the NS: 
driver) are portable.  The RSX network utilites are not provided but 
there are equivalent VMS and DECnet-VMS utilities.
