PRODUCT NAME:  VAX PRODUCER Interpreter, Version 1.7     SPD 26.53.04 

  DESCRIPTION 
  
  The VAX PRODUCER Interpreter is a software package which consists of 
  components used in the delivery of applications created using the
  VAX PRODUCER development system. 
  
  The Interpreter 
  
  The VAX PRODUCER Interpreter reads and processes files created using the VAX
  PRODUCER development system. Two types of files are supported: Display  
  Libraries (which are created by the VAX DRAW graphics editor and hold the 
  visual information) and pseudo-code files (PRODUCER applications), created by
  using the VAX DESIGN Preprocessor and Linker (which contain the branching,  
  response, and judging information).  VAX DESIGN is the language of VAX  
  PRODUCER used to create highly interactive and graphically oriented programs,  
  and may be used in such applications as Computer Based Instruction (CBI),  
  point of purchase, or information retrieval. 

    
  The VAX PRODUCER Interpreter also has the following capabilities:
  
  ^  Controlling an IVIS system and the connected videodisc player 
  
  ^  If an IVIS system or the Professional 300 Series system with hard disk      
     has the DECtouch option, the VAX PRODUCER Interpreter is also capable of
     receiving input from the DECtouch touch screen and other DECtouch      
     supported devices 
  
  ^  Calling other programs on the VMS system as directed by commands
     in the PRODUCER application 
  
  ^  Accessing and running PRODUCER applications as well as accessing      
     Display Libraries, over a DECnet network. 
  
  
  VAX PRODUCER ADMIN (delivery system)
  
  VAX PRODUCER ADMIN (delivery system) provides a delivery environment  for VAX
  PRODUCER applications. The system consists of the following components: 
  
  ^  Application Delivery Interface (ADI), which serves as the interface
     between the user and the application 
  
  ^  Application Delivery Manager (ADM), which allows the site      
     administrator to enter applications into a database, authorize and      
     register users and generate reports 
  
  ^  Database files which contain user authorization, enrollment and      
     performance information, in addition to application installation and
     usage data. These files may be read by other DIGITAL database management
     and report generating utilities, so that customized reports can be
     created.
