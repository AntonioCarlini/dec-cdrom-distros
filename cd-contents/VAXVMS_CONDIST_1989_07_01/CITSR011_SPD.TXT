PRODUCT NAME:  VAX Computer Integrated Telephony Server
	       (VAX CIT Server), Version 1.1          SPD 29.91.01

DESCRIPTION

The VAX Computer Integrated Telephony Server (CIT Server) is a 
software product which provides functional integration between the 
DIGITAL computing environment and a PBX.  This release of the VAX CIT 
Server software adds support for communications between a VAX and 
the Northern Telecom Meridian SL-1 PBX Generic X.11 Release 13 
available in North America.  

Version 1.1 is also a maintenance release for the British Telecom Mitel 
Regent 257 available in the UK supported in Version 1.0 of CIT.  Version 
1.1 is functionally compatible with Version 1.0.

In the DIGITAL computing environment, access to the CIT Server is through 
the VAX Computer Integrated Telephony Applications Interface (CIT 
Applications Interface), a software product which provides programmers 
with an applications interface comprising a library of VMS routines. 
These routines enable the programmer to initiate telephone calls and 
monitor the progress of those calls for telephones connected to a 
CIT-compatible PBX.  The CIT Applications Interface routines comply with 
the VMS Standard for Procedure Calling and Condition Handling, and so 
present a familiar interface to VMS applications programmers. 

These routines allow the applications programmer to establish and 
control logical communications channels between a VAX and the 
associated PBX.  These channels can be used for basic call
processing, such as making and accepting telephone calls, and for 
additional call processing such as transferring calls and conferencing 
calls.

The VAX CIT Applications Interface is client software that provides the
high-level interface for applications programmers, passing the
application's requests to CIT Server software. 

VAX CIT Server software resides on a VAX host.  This VAX host is
connected to a CIT-compatible PBX by means of a synchronous communications
link.  The CIT Server software communicates with the CIT-compatible PBX and 
the CIT Applications Interface client nodes, acting as an intermediary 
passing messages between the PBX and the CIT Applications Interfaces.
