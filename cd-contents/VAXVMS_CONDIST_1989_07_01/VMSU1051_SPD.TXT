PRODUCT NAME: VMS Operating System, Version 5.1        SPD 25.01.31
  
DESCRIPTION
  
System Overview 

VMS is a general purpose multiuser operating system which supports VAX,
MicroVAX, and VAXstation series computers. It works reliably and
efficiently in both development and production environments.  VMS can be
tuned to perform well in a wide variety of applications, including
compute-intensive, I/O-intensive, real-time, and combinations of those and
other environments. (The actual amount of work supported with good
performance depends upon the processor type, available physical memory, and
secondary storage operations.) 

VMS has well-integrated networking, distributed computing, multiprocessing 
and windowing capabilities. VMS contains extensive features that promote 
ease-of-use, improve the productivity of programmers and facilitate system 
management.

User Environment 

General Access
  
Users may access VMS by using the English-like DIGITAL Command Language 
(DCL), the standard command language for VMS which is supplied with the 
system.  DCL commands take the form of a command name followed by parameters 
and qualifiers. 

DCL commands can be entered from a terminal or can be included in command 
procedures.   Command procedures may be invoked directly in an 
interactive session of may be submitted to a batch queue for deferred 
execution.  DCL commands provide information about the system, initiate 
system utilities, and initiate user programs. 

DCL and VMS Utilities have a consistent integrated help subsystem to provide 
summary operational information on all aspects of system operation. 
  
Tools and Utilities
 
VMS provides a number of tools and utilities for general users, programmers 
and system managers.  This section briefly describes each group of tools 
and utilities.  

General User
      
Text processing - The Extensible VAX Editor (EVE) is one of several text 
editors supplied by DIGITAL and it permits the user to quickly insert and
delete text.  EVE is a full screen editor that allows the text to be scrolled 
on the screen of an interactive terminal. EVE is written in the Text
Processing Utility (TPU) language.  EVE provides an EDT-style keypad.
      
Mail facility - The Mail facility permits a user to send messages to any 
other user by typing the recipient's name, the subject of the message, and the
text of the message.  Multi-node operation is available if DECnet-VAX is 
installed.
    
Command-level programming - Command-level programming allows the user to 
create special files called command procedures that contain a series of
DCL commands.  When a user invokes a command procedure, the system processes 
the commands in the command procedure.  The user can also use special DCL 
commands to assign symbolic names, evaluate numerical and logical expressions, 
accept parameters, communicate interactively with the user invoking the 
command procedure, perform conditional (IF-THEN-ELSE) and branching (GOTO) 
logic, and handle error conditions.

User Environment Tailoring - VMS allows user tailoring of their environment, 
including user specific login command files, shorthand commands, binding 
of commands to function keys, and command recall and editing.

Other utilities include Sort/Merge, DIRECTORY, COPY, DELETE, TYPE, PRINT, 
PURGE, RENAME and SET/SHOW status. 
 
Programmer
     
Librarian utility - The Librarian utility permits efficient storage of 
object modules, macros, help text, or any general record-oriented information 
in central, easily accessible files.  Object module libraries are searched 
by the linker when the linker finds a reference it cannot resolve in one
of its input files.  Macro libraries are searched by the assembler when the 
assembler finds a macro that is not defined in the input file.  
 
Symbolic debugger - The symbolic debugger helps the user trace program 
execution and allows a user to display and modify register contents using 
the same symbols that are in the source code.  
   
RMS file utilities - RMS file utilities allow the user to analyze the 
internal structure of an RMS file. They can help the user determine the most 
appropriate set of parameters for an RMS file, and how to create,
efficiently load, and reclaim space in an RMS file.  (Refer to ``VMS Record 
Management Services'' section of this SPD for more information on RMS.)

File differences utility - This utility compares the contents of two 
files and lists those records that do not match.
 
Terminal Fallback Facility (TFF) - This facility allows DEC 7bit terminals, 
such as the VT100, to input and output the DEC Multinational Character Set 
(MCS).  Specific tables allow conversion for a number of different
7bit National Replacement Character sets, such as French, German, Spanish 
and Swedish, to MCS.  TFF also allows character composing on terminals 
without use of the compose key.

National Character Set (NCS) utility - This utility allows the user to 
define non-ASCII standard string collating sequences and to define 
conversion functions.  Conversion functions use conversion algorithms 
to change an input string, for example, change lower case characters to 
upper case. NCS also allows RMS indexed files to be collated via
user-specified collating sequences.
      
System Manager
 
Backup - This utility provides full volume and incremental file backup for
file-structured, mounted volumes and volume sets.  Individual files, selected 
directory structures, or all files on a volume set can be backed up and
restored using standard file naming conventions and can be selected by date.  
Files can be backed up to magnetic tape or to another disk.  You can back 
up and restore selected files using on-line backup or entire volumes
using standalone backup.

Analyze disk structure - This utility compares the structure information on 
a disk volume with the contents of the disk, prints the structure
information, and permits changes to that information.
 
MONITOR - This utility permits the system manager to monitor different 
classes of systemwide performance data (for example, process activity, I/O
activity, and memory management activity) at user-specified intervals.  The 
data may be displayed as it is gathered or saved in a file for later use.  
 
License Management Facility (LMF) - This facility allows the system manager 
to easily determine which software products are licensed and installed on 
a standalone VAX and on each of the VAX systems in a VAXcluster System.  
It allows the system manager to limit use of the software products to a 
subset of systems in a VAXcluster and it provides an audit trail which 
allows the system manager to track license changes that occur within a 
VAXcluster system.  Refer to the section entitled ``VAXcluster Support '' 
for more information on VAXcluster Systems.
 
VMS System Management (SYSMAN) Utility - This utility allows the system 
manager to define a system management environment so that operations 
performed from the local VAX system are executed on all other
VAX systems in the defined environment. The environment may include VAX 
systems in a DECnet-VAX network or in a VAXcluster System.

Program Development 
  
VMS provides a comprehensive set of tools for developing programs including 
editors (such as EVE for editing source programs), a linker, a librarian,
and a symbolic debugger.  The assembly-level VAX MACRO language is supplied 
with VMS. 

The VMS Run-Time Library provides general string manipulation, Input/Output 
(I/O), I/O conversion, terminal independent screen handling, date and time 
formatting routines, common mathematical functions, signaling and condition
handling, and other general purpose functions.  These routines can be called 
from programs written in VAX MACRO or from VAX Ada, VAX BASIC, BLISS-32
Implementation Language, VAX C, VAX COBOL, VAX DIBOL, VAX FORTRAN, 
VAX PASCAL, VAX PL/I, VAX RPG, and VAX SCAN.  

Major VAX languages (including those listed above adhere to the VAX 
common calling standard, meaning that routines written in any of 
these languages may directly call routines written in any other 
language.  Development of applications using multiple languages is 
simple and straightforward.

All routines in the run-time library follow standard call and condition 
handling conventions and most are contained within a shareable image.
                                              
At a lower level, programs can call system services directly for security, 
event flag, asynchronous system trap, logical name, record and file I/O, 
process control, timer, time conversion, condition handling, lock
management, and memory management services.  Again, system services use 
standard call and condition handling conventions.

VMS supports execution of non-privileged images created on earlier versions 
of VMS.  Recompiling and relinking are in general not required. 

System Management

Security and Control  

VMS provides privilege, protection, and quota mechanisms to control 
user access to system-controlled structures in physical structures in 
physical memory, system-structured files and volumes, and certain devices.

The system maintains information about user accounts in the user 
authorization file (UAF), which can be modified by the system manager. 
When creating user accounts with the Authorize Utility, the system manager 
assigns the privileges and quotas associated with each user account. The 
system manager also assigns a unique user name, password, and user 
identification code (UIC) to each account.  Optionally, additional 
identifiers may be assigned to each account, permitting users to 
belong to multiple overlapping groups or projects.  Account use may be 
limited by time of day, day of week and type of access, such as local 
vs. remote vs. batch.  

To log in and gain access to the system, the user must supply the 
user name and password.  The password is encoded and does not appear on 
terminal displays.  Users can change their password voluntarily, or the 
system manager can selectively enforce password length, change 
frequency, and generation of pronounceable nonsense passwords.

Login security includes breakin detection, which allows terminals 
to be disabled when password guessing is detected.  When a user 
logs in, the system displays a message stating when the last 
login for the account occurred. 

A UIC consists of two fields, the unique user field and a group field. 
Every file, device, queue, or other system object is labeled with the 
UIC of its owner (normally the user who created the object).

Files, devices, queues, and other system objects are assigned a 
protection mask which allows read, execute, write, and delete access 
to be selectively granted to the object's owner and group, to 
privileged system users, and to all other users.  In addition, files, 
devices, queues, and some other system objects may be protected with 
access control lists to allow access to be selectively granted or 
denied to a list of individual users, groups or identifiers.

Scavenge protection may be selectively enabled in the form of file 
high-water marking, erase on allocate, and erase on delete, to ensure 
that file contents cannot be read after the file has been deleted.

Security alarms are provided to allow selective auditing of security 
related events, including

^ Login and logout

^ Login failures and breakin attempts

^ Authorization changes

^ File access, selectable by use of privilege, type of access, and by 
  individual file

Note that DIGITAL does not warrant that the system is secure, although 
DIGITAL will fix security problems brought to our attention as 
promptly as circumstances warrant.

Tailoring Facility
  
Tailoring allows users to have access to the entire VMS operating system
while providing a compact version of the operating system on the system
disk that is tailored to the users' needs.  Tailoring is supported on
processors with small disk configuration. VMS upgrade procedures are not
supported in tailored environments. 
  
Due to space constraints, there is no guarantee that products can be 
installed if user code and data reside on the system disk.  Application 
programs will execute as long as the layered products or optional
software DO NOT DEPEND on optional software run-time components that are 
not supported in the tailored environment. Refer to the product's 
System Support Addendum (SSA) for the optional products supported in 
the tailored environment.
  
Installation
   
VMS is distributed as binary kits on tape, disk, or CDROM. Procedures 
for setting up the system disk from a kit and for preparing the system 
for day-to-day operations are simple and straightforward. The procedures are
described in the installation and operation guide for each processor. 

Batch/Print Facility

VMS provides an extensive batch/print facility which allows the creation 
of queues and spooled devices in order to process non-interactive workloads 
in parallel with timesharing or real-time jobs.

The system queues batch jobs for execution. The system manager 
can regulate the number of queues and the number of streams per 
queue (that is, the number of batch jobs in the queue that can 
execute concurrently).  
  
Different batch job queues may have different attributes such as 
the maximum  CPU time permitted, working set size, and priority.  
Facilities are provided for starting and stopping queues, as well 
as the jobs in a queue. 

Print queues, both generic and specific (with forms recognition) 
together with queue management facilities give the user versatile 
print capabilities.

Accounting

For accounting purposes, VMS keeps records of the use of system resources. 
These statistics include processor and memory utilization, I/O counts, 
print symbiont line counts, image activation counts, and process 
termination records.

Autoconfigure/Autogen

VMS provides utilities to automatically configure the available 
devices into the system tables, and to set system operational 
parameters based on the detected peripheral and memory configuration.
There is no need for a traditional "system generation" process 
when the hardware configuration is expanded or otherwise modified.

VMSINSTAL

VMS includes an facility to automate operating system software 
updates, as well as handle the installation of optional DIGITAL-supplied 
software products.

System Environment
  
Process and Scheduling
  
The basic unit of execution in VMS is the process which consists of 
individual address space and registers known as ``context'' and code 
called an ``executable image.''  The context identifies the process 
and describes its current state.  Executable images consist of system
programs and user programs that have been compiled and linked.
  
The maximum number of concurrent processes is 8192 per VAX system. 

Processes receive processor time to execute their images based on the 
priority of the process.  Thirty-two priorities are recognized:  
Priorities 0-15 are for time-sharing processes and applications
that are not time critical (four is the typical default for time-sharing 
processes) and priorities 16-31 are for real-time processes.  

Each time an event such as an I/O interrupt occurs, the system first services 
the event then passes control to the highest priority process ready to 
execute.  The system automatically adjusts priorities of processes whose base
priority is in the range of 0 to 15 to favor I/O-bound processes, but the 
system will not adjust the priority of a process in the range of 16 to 31.

Real-time processes can be assigned higher priorities to ensure that they 
receive processor time whenever they are ready to execute. Real-time 
processes are scheduled pre-emptively; that is, if a real-time process is 
ready to execute, it is given the processor immediately, unless
a real-time process with a higher priority is ready to execute. 
  
VMS uses paging and swapping mechanisms to provide sufficient physical memory 
for both multiple concurrently executing processes and for processes whose 
memory requirements exceed available physical memory. The maximum working 
set size is 100,000 pages of memory.

Processes can, however, exercise control over memory management.  A real-time 
process, for example, can inhibit paging or swapping of critical code and data.

Peripheral devices can be managed by the system or allocated by individual 
processes.  At least one disk must be a system disk. Other disks can be 
designated as data disks for the general use of all users logging into the 
system or for a group of users. Interactive terminals are controlled by the 
system, and the system normally controls one or more printers.  

Interprocess Communication

VMS provides a number of facilities for application that consist of 
multiple cooperating processes:

^ Mailboxes are virtual devices that allow processes to communicate 
  with queued messages.

^ Shared memory sections permit multiple processes concurrent access 
  to shared address space.

^ Common event flags provide simple synchronization.

^ The lock manager provides a more comprehensive enqueue/dequeue 
  facility with multi-level locks, values, and ASTs.
        
Symmetric Multiprocessing

VMS provides symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) support for multiprocessor 
VAX systems.  SMP is a form of tightly coupled multiprocessing in which 
all processors perform operations simultaneously.  The processors can 
perform operations in all VAX access modes (user, supervisor, 
executive, and kernel).

VMS SMP configurations consist of multiple central processing units 
executing code from a single shared memory address space.  Users and
processes share a single copy of VMS.  SMP also provides simultaneous shared 
access to common data in global sections to all processors.  VMS SMP
dynamically balances the execution of all processes across all available 
processors based on process priority.  

SMP support is an integral part of VMS and is provided transparently to 
the user.  Because an SMP system is a single system entity, it is configured 
into a network and VAXcluster systems as a single node.

VAXcluster Support
    
A VAXcluster system is formed by coupling a VAX processor with mass-storage 
servers or with other VAX systems, and, optionally, with mass storage 
servers known as ``Hierarchical Storage Controllers'' (HSCs).  These 
cooperating, independent processors may share a single disk-resident copy of 
VMS, RMS data down to the record level, and locally attached or HSC-based 
disks. VAXcluster systems provide data sharing and easy incremental growth, 
and may be configured to provide high availability computing environments.

Refer to VAXcluster Software (SPD 29.78.xx) for more information.

Networking Facilities
  
VMS provides device drivers for all DIGITAL Ethernet adapters listed below.  
Application programmers can use the QIO system service to communicate with 
other systems connected via the Ethernet using either Ethernet or IEEE 802.3 
packet format.  Simultaneous use of DIGITAL Ethernet and IEEE 802.3 protocols 
are supported on any DIGITAL Ethernet adapter. Refer to the DECnet-VAX
Software Product Description (SPD 25.03.xx) for further information on 
supported communications devices.
  
DIGITAL's terminal server products can be used for terminal access to VMS.  
When used in a VAXcluster System environment, terminal servers automatically
distribute users, at login time, across the available VAX systems.

VMS can also establish a connection to other devices (such as printers) 
attached to such terminal servers.
 
DECnet-VAX offers task-to-task communications, file management, downline 
system and task loading, network command terminals, and network resource 
sharing capabilities using the DIGITAL Network Architecture (DNA) protocols. 
Refer to DECnet-VAX (SPD 25.03.xx) for more information on this product.

Reliability
  
The system handles errors as transparently as possible while maintaining 
data integrity and providing sufficient information to diagnose the
errors.  The system limits the effects of an error by first attempting 
to recover from the error; then if recovery fails, by reporting the error 
to the current process for action; and finally (if the error cannot be 
clearly bounded), by shutting down and restarting the system.  VMS will 
shut itself down rather than continue operating with a condition that
could propagate undetected bad data.  The types of errors possible 
are as follows:
  
^  Processor errors (machine checks)
  
^  Operating system errors (system errors or undetected hardware failures)

^  User errors 
  
^  Memory errors  (The system examines memory at start-up time and does
   not use any pages found to be bad.  During system operation, the
   hardware transparently corrects all single-bit memory errors, for
   those systems with ECC memory.  An unrecoverable error causes the memory 
   page on which the error occurred to be added to the bad page list; if 
   the page has not been modified, system operation continues with a 
   new copy of the page.)
  
^  I/O errors 
  
The system logs all processor errors, all operating system errors detected 
through internal consistency checks, all double-bit memory errors (and a 
summary of corrected single-bit errors), and all I/O errors.  (Double-bit 
errors are detected only on those VAX and MicroVAX systems with ECC memory.)
  
If the system is shut down because of an unrecoverable hardware or software 
error, a dump of physical memory is written; the dump includes the contents 
of the processor registers.  The VMS System Dump Analyzer utility is 
provided for analyzing dumps.
  
If power fails, the system shuts down automatically.  When power is restored, 
the system restarts automatically and resumes processing at the point of
interruption if the system has a time-of-day clock and a memory battery 
back-up unit, if the contents of memory are still valid and if the system 
is set to permit automatic re-booting.  The system restarts devices and 
communications lines.   All I/O operations in progress, including magnetic 
tape, are restarted.  On request, programs can be notified of power 
restoration.  An optional battery operated hardware clock resets the date 
and time of day when the system restarts.  If the system does not have a
battery backup unit, or if the memory contents are not valid on power 
restoration, the system will reboot automatically if the system is set to
permit automatic rebooting. 
  
If, for any reason, the system disk does not come back on line after a 
power failure within a specific time after the CPU regains power, the 
system shuts down.
  
Diagnostics can be run on individual devices during normal system operation. 
    
Certain critical components can operate in degraded mode.  For example, the 
memory cache can be disabled. The system places a component in degraded mode 
when errors pass a threshold level.
  
VMS includes a User Environment Test Package which verifies that the VMS 
operating system is properly installed on the customer's configuration and 
ready for use.
  
Input/Output

The QIO system services provide a direct interface to the operating systems 
I/O routines.  These services are available from within most VAX 
programming languages and can be used to perform low-level I/O operations 
efficiently with a minimal amount of system overhead for time-critical
applications.  

Device drivers execute I/O instructions to transfer data to and from the 
device and to communicate directly with an I/O device.  Each type of
I/O device requires its own driver.  DIGITAL supplies drivers for all 
devices supported by the VMS Operating System and provides QIO system service
routines to access the special device dependent features available in many 
of these devices.  Users with special needs or nonstandard devices can write
their own device drivers.  (The ``VMS Device Support Manual'' in the VMS 
Extended Documentation set describes how to write your own device driver.)    

The VMS Operating System supports a variety of disk and tape peripheral 
devices, as well as terminals, networks, mailboxes (virtual devices for 
interprocess communication), and more general I/O devices, including line 
printers, card readers, and general data acquisition devices.

VMS Record Management Services (VMS RMS)
 
VMS RMS is a set of I/O services that help application programs process 
and manage files and records.  Although it is primarily intended to
provide a comprehensive software interface to mass storage devices, VMS 
RMS also supports device-independent access to unit-record devices. 

VMS RMS supports sequential, relative, and indexed file organizations in 
fixed-length and variable-length record formats.  VMS RMS also supports 
byte stream formats for sequential file organization. VMS RMS record
access modes provide access to records in four ways:  sequentially, directly 
by key value, directly by relative record number, and directly by record
file address.  VMS RMS also supports block I/O operations for various 
performance-critical applications that may require user-defined file
organizations and record formats. 
 
VMS RMS ensures safe and efficient file sharing by providing multiple 
file access modes, automatic record locking where applicable, and optional 
buffer sharing by multiple processes.  

VMS RMS utilities aid file creation and record maintenance.  These 
utilities convert files from one organization and format to another, 
restructure indexed files for storage and access efficiency, and
reclaim data structures within indexed files.  The utilities also 
generate appropriate reports. 

For systems that have DECnet installed, VMS RMS provides a subset of 
file and record management services to remote network nodes. Network remote 
file operations are generally transparent to user programs.

DCL commands such as EDIT, CREATE, COPY, TYPE, and PRINT allow manipulation 
at the DCL command level of RMS files and records within RMS files.  

Disks and Tape Volumes
  
Disk volumes can be organized into volume sets.  Volume sets can contain 
a mix of disk device types and can be extended by adding volumes.  Within a
volume set, files of any organization type can span multiple volumes.  
Files can be allocated to the set as a whole (the default) or to specific
volumes within the set.  Optionally, portions of indexed files can be 
allocated to specific areas of a single disk volume or to specific volumes 
in a volume set.
  
Disk quotas can be placed on the amount of space individual users can 
allocate.  Quota assignment is made by User Identification Code and can 
be controlled for each volume set in the system (or for each individual
volume if the volume is not part of a set).
  
Disk structure information can be cached in memory to reduce the I/O 
overhead required for file management services.  Although not required 
to do so, users can preallocate space and control automatic allocation.
For example,  a file can be extended by a given number of blocks, 
contiguously or noncontiguously, for optimal file system performance 
in specific cases.
  
The system applies software validity checks and checksums to critical 
disk structure information.   If a volume is improperly dismounted because 
of user error or system failure, the system automatically rebuilds the 
volume's structure information the next time the volume is mounted.  The 
system detects bad blocks dynamically and prevents their reuse once the
files to which the blocks were allocated are deleted. On Digital Storage 
Architecture (DSA) disks, the disk controller dynamically detects and 
replaces bad blocks automatically.
  
The system provides eight levels of named directories and subdirectories 
whose contents are alphabetically ordered.  Device and file specifications 
follow standard DIGITAL conventions.  Logical names can be used to
abbreviate the specifications and to make application programs device and 
file-name independent.  A logical name can be assigned to an entire 
specification, to a portion of a specification, or to another logical
name.
  
VMS supports multi-volume magnetic tape files with transparent volume 
switching.  Access positioning is done either by filename or by relative 
file position.

VMS DECwindows Features 

Integral to VMS V5.1 is support for the DECwindows desktop environment.
This new computing environment is based on the industry standard X
Window System (tm).  X Version 11 is a network based window system.  
The protocol is implemented in teh servers on the display end, and 
libraries on teh client end.  DIGITAL fully supports the X 11 Protocol 
in the VMS DECwindows Clients, Libraries, and Server with DECnet as 
the underlying communications protocol.

To determine whether a specific DECwindows application runs distributed
across different operating systems, refer to the application's product
description.  The applications included with VMS (described in 
following sections below) are supported for distributed operation 
between VMS systems.
  
The DECwindows desktop environment also provides a new user interface
to VMS and promotes the establishment of a consistent style of graphical
VMS user interface by including a new set of integrated desktop applications.

X Window System Support

The VMS implementation of the DECwindows environment is compatible 
with X Window System, Version 11. This conformance has been validated 
by use of the X Testing Consortium's validation suites.  Specifically, 
conformance is provided as follows:

^ Support is included for the X display server, X network protocol,
  and X programming library (Xlib) from Release 2 of the X Window 
  System.

^ Support is included for the Xtoolkit programming library from 
  Release 3 of the X Window System(tm). 

Workstation Device Support

The VMS DECwindows environment provides several software components to support
displaying graphics and windowing output on and receiving keyboard and pointer 
driver input from VAX workstations.

Device drivers are provided to support output to monochrome and color displays
and to receive input from keyboard, mouse, and tablet devices.

Display servers compatible with the X Window System receive output
requests from applications and translate those requests into driver commands.
They also relay driver generated input events back to the applications.

Over 400 video fonts are provided in a variety of styles and point sizes
for use on 75 and 100 dot per inch (dpi) monitors.  These video fonts have
been designed to correspond directly to the fonts used by DIGITAL's 
PostScript (R) printers.  In addition, a font compiler is provided so that
customers can make their own private fonts available on their DECwindows
systems. 

The User Environment

The user environment consists of four basic components.

The Session Manager provides the top-level user interface to a DECwindows
workstation.  It performs application activation, session-wide customization,
screen printing, security management, and session control.

The Window Manager provides user control for overlapping windows through
various functions.

FileView is a graphical interface to the VMS Operating System that allows
users to execute system commands and run DECwindows applications. 

The DECterm terminal emulator provides workstation users with a familiar
interface for accessing existing VMS features and applications. It is a
ReGIS and sixel capable VT320 terminal emulator.  Programs written for
VT52, VT100, VT220, or VT320 class terminals and using standard VMS
terminal driver features operate without modification in this workstation
window.  DECterm additionally provides workstation-oriented features such
as mouse-based cursor positioning, variable screen sizes, and cutting and
pasting of text between terminal emulators and other DECwindows applications.

Applications

A set of integrated desktop applications is provided as a base component
of the DECwindows environment.  These applications establish and demonstrate 
the consistent DECwindows user model.  They also provide some basic end user
capabilities.  

These applications are:

^ Bookreader - A tool for viewing the contents of books that are 
  distributed and stored on-line

^  Calculator - A simple four function calculator

^  Calendar - A personal time management system

^  Cardfiler - An hierarchical information storage application similar 
   to an online address and/or phone book

^  Clock - An analog and/or digital date and time display

^  Compound document viewers - tools for reading documents containing 
   compound text, graphics, and image data on terminals and 
   DECwindows workstations

^  Mail - A DECwindows user interface to the VMS mail facility

^  Notepad - A simple text editor

^  Paint - A simple bitmap graphics editor 

^  Puzzle game - A game that challenges you to sort mixed up puzzle tiles

^  TPU/EVE - A DECwindows user interface to the VMS TPU/EVE editor

Execution of and output display from each of the above applications is
supported across the network between VMS systems.

Programming Support

The VMS DECwindows environment includes an extensive set of programming 
libraries and tools for use by developers of new applications.   These
components support the development of portable applications by focusing
on three broad areas:

^ X Window System (X) support

^ X User Interface (XUI) support

^ Compound Document Architecture (CDA) support

Components from each of these areas can be used in any combination to 
address the needs of applications.  They can also use the tools from a
variety of different programming languages.  The X and XUI programming 
libraries have all been provided with procedural language bindings in 
both the style of the VAX calling standard and the style of the MIT C 
language programming conventions.  The CDA libraries have been provided 
only with VAX calling standard bindings.

Specific support is provided for the following languages:

VAX Ada				 VAX FORTRAN
VAX BASIC			 VAX MACRO
BLISS-32 Implementation Language VAX Pascal

X Window System (X) Programming Support

The X Window System compatible X programming library (Xlib) provided by 
the VMS DECwindows environment provides basic resource management (windows, 
color maps, input devices) and bitmap graphics services.  It defines a 
mapping of the X network protocol to a procedure library.

The Xtoolkit programming library included with release 3 of the X Version
11 Window System is also supported by the VMS DECwindows environment.
It is described further under XUI Programming Support.

X User Interface (XUI) Programming Support

XUI determines the application model for digital and third-party software
tailored for the DECwindows environment.  It establishes the conventions  and
styles that are encouraged for applications that share a DECwindows 
workstation.  Applications use XUI components to build user interfaces that 
make them look and feel like integrated members of the DIGITAL computing 
environment.

The XUI Style Guide, available in the VMS DECwindows Programming Kit,
describes the principles, philosophy, and components used to build 
consistent and well-integrated DECwindows applications.

Its concepts are implemented by the XUI Toolkit.  The XUI Toolkit is a 
superset of the X Window System Xtoolkit and contains four components:

^ Xtoolkit components for managing, modifying, and creating user
  interface components (known as widgets and gadgets)

^ DECwindows widgets and gadgets for implementing common user interface 
  objects such as scroll bars, menus, and push buttons

^ Utility routines that provide applications with functions for 
  performing common tasks such as cut and paste

^ Resource manager routines for loading user interface definition
  files and creating widgets and gadgets based on their contents

The XUI Toolkit is used in conjunction with the DECwindows User Interface 
Lanaguage (UIL) compiler.  The user interface definition files produced by 
this compiler contain the data to separate form and function in DECwindows 
applications and allow DECwindows toolkit widget and gadget details, such 
as menu item labels, to be stored separately from the toolkit and application 
run-time code. This  capability allows application developers to easily
prototype and modify user interface designs, separate form and function in
applications, and support internationalizable products. 

Compound Document Architecture (CDA) Programming Support

The CDA Toolkit provides access routines that applications can use to easily
create, read, and write files containing compound text, graphics, and imaging
data.  These files provide a vehicle for recording this information on disk, 
a medium for interchange of this data between applications, and an 
intermediate form from which high-resolution printable graphics data can be
generated.

In addition to providing support for developing new applications to
access compound documents, VMS also provides fallback support allowing
many existing utilities to read and operate on these new kinds of files.

Transport Mechanisms
  
VMS DECwindows supports two different mechanisms for transport of X network
protocol packets between applications and display servers.  

The  first mechanism is DECnet. This transport is used when the DECwindows 
application and display server are distributed across two different machines 
in the network.  

The second mechanism is a VMS DECwindows-specific shared memory-based
transport. When the DECwindows application and display server are located on 
the same workstation, this optimization provides significantly greater
performance. It is the default transport under these circumstances.

VAX Volume Shadowing

VAX Volume Shadowing is a feature available on VAX systems 
using HSC-series controllers with RA-series disks. This feature 
enhances data availability by duplicating all data written to 
disk onto two or three compatible disk volumes.  Refer to VAX 
Volume Shadowing (SPD 27.29.xx) for more information.

VAX RMS Journaling

VAX RMS Journaling is a tool which maintains the data integrity 
of RMS files in the face of a number of failure scenarios.  
It helps to protect RMS file data from becoming lost or 
inconsistent. Refer to VAX RMS Journaling (SPD 27.58.xx) for more
information.

GROWTH CONSIDERATIONS

The minimum hardware requirements for any future version of this product
may be different from the minimum hardware requirements of this version.
 
VMS Disk Block Requirements
      
Block Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 2):
      
The disk block size for the VMS Operating System, Version 5.1, after 
installation is approximately 61,000 blocks.  This figure includes 5,600 
blocks for page and swap files.  Most systems will require larger
page and swap files.  This figure also includes library files which are 
in data-reduced format.  Most system managers choose to expand these 
files (for faster access). The expansion requires approximately 7,000 
additional blocks.

At least 9,000 free blocks are required to update from VMS V5.0 or V5.0-x
to VMS V5.1. The recommended amount is 23,000 free blocks. 

VMS DECwindows Disk Block Requirements

The disk block size for the complete VMS DECwindows environment after
installation is approximately 50,000 blocks. This is in addition to
the 61,000 blocks required for the other components of the VMS operating 
system environment.  Select portions of the environment may be installed 
therefore using less disk space. Peak usage during installation is within 
5,000 blocks of the net usage for that installation. 

The following list describes how many blocks are needed for each section: 

^ User environment and applications - 16,500 blocks. This section 
  provides support for running VMS DECwindows applications on VAX
  compute servers.

^ Workstation device support - 8,000 blocks.  This number includes
  2,500 blocks for the 75 dpi fonts and 3,000 blocks for the 100 dpi
  fonts.  On 75 dpi systems, the 100 dpi fonts do not have to be
  installed. On 100 dpi systems, both sets of fonts must be installed.

^ Programming support - 25,000 blocks (approximately 3,000 per language).  
  This number includes support for all the programming languages.  
  If only a subset of languages are installed, the amount of disk space 
  will be less. 

Note that the individual sizes add up to more than the total because some
components are shared by multiple portions of the environment. Please refer
to documentation for details concerning the partial installation of the
VMS DECwindows software.

Memory Requirements
 
The following tables describe the minimum amount of memory required for a
system user to install, boot and login to a VMS system. To ensure
satisfactory performance of applications, additional memory will 
be required.
 
The minimum amount of memory supported for a standalone VMS system 
is 2 MB. This first table contains the minimum amount of additional memory
required for the following components to be installed on a VMS system.

Component                                Necessary Memory

DECnet                                          .5

VAXcluster                                     1.5

DECwindows with remote execution               1.5
 of applications 

DECwindows with local execution                2.0
 of applications 

Two example configurations based on the above table are:

System                               Minimum Supported Memory

DECwindows with applications 
executing remotely, and DECnet                 4.0

DECwindows with applications 
executing locally, VAXcluster and DECnet       6.0

Note: These memory requirements are the minimums. More memory will be
      required for satisfactory performance of the operating system and
      DECwindows applications. The performance and memory usage of VMS
      DECwindows systems is particularly sensitive to system configuration 
      and window and application usage. Remote execution of an application 
      requires an additional system which runs the application while the 
      display of the application occurs on the local workstation.

Please refer to specific layered product Software Product Descriptions for
their memory requirements. 

Please refer to VMS documentation for more information on performance.

VMS DECwindows System Restrictions

The VMS DECwindows software is not supported on the MicroVAX I,
VAXstation I, VAX-11/725 and the VAX-11/730.

VMS License Information

The VMS Operating System uses one of four different kinds of licenses 
depending on the hardware and software configurations used and 
currently supported.  These are the four types of VMS licenses:

VMS Availability License

This type of license provides unlimited use to the users on a system.  
These licenses are sometimes referred to as capacity licenses.  VMS 
availability licenses are sized according to system type.

VMS Multiuser License

This type of license provides use according to a specified number of 
concurrent users.  This is an activity-based license.

VMS Workstation License

This type of license provides use for a single-user on a VAX 
Workstation.

VMS Server License

This type of license provides for the non-interactive use of VMS.

Not all VMS license types are available for all system models.

If no VMS license is registered and activated via the License 
Management Facility, then a single login is permitted for system 
management purposes, generally through the system console (OPA0:).

Several of the VMS license types are based on number of concurrent 
uses called an activity license.  Every product has the option to 
define an activity as related to the License Management Facility.  VMS 
defines activities, sometimes referred to as VMS ``users'', as 
follows:

^ Each remote terminal connection is considered an activity.  This is 
  true even if you set host to your local node (SET HOST 0).

^ Each connection from a terminal server is considered an activity.

^ A multiple-window session on a workstation is considered one 
  activity, regardless of the number of windows.

^ A batch job is not considered an activity.

^ A remote network connection (other than a remote terminal 
  connection) is not considered an activity.

Appendix A
                                                     
This appendix describes some restrictions to the system
configurations listed in the charts.  See the VAX System
and Options Catalog and the Network and Communications
Buyers Guide for details of VAX hardware configurations.  

MicroVAX I/ VAXstation I Systems

The VMS DECwindows environment is not supported on these systems.

MicroVAX II System

The CX series boards can be used in a BA213 cabinet only. 

MicroVAX 2000 and VAXstation 2000 Systems

DECnet-VAX supports only one asynchronous data/modem RS-232C
serial line up to 9600 baud on the integral 4 line asynchronous
controller.

VAXserver 3602 System

The VAXserver 3602 is two VAXserver 3600 systems.

VAX-11/725 and VAX-11/730 System

The VAX-11/730 system supports additional memory to a
maximum of 5 MB for systems configured with R80/RL02 or
dual RL02 disks.  Other VAX-11/730 system configurations
support a maximum of 3 MB of memory for the VAX-11/730 only.

A maximum of two RL02 disk drives can be added to the
dual RL02 and the R80/RL02 configuration for VAX-11/730 only.

The VAX-11/725 and the VAX-11/730 systems supports one UNIBUS magnetic 
tape subsystem.

Refer to Hardware System and Options Catalogue for the different hardware
options supported on these systems.

The VMS DECwindows environment is not supported on these systems.

VAX-11/750 System

The VAX-11/750 system must be at a minimum hardware ECO Revision
of 4.  However, if the VAX-11/750 system has a CI750
adapter or a UDA50 controller, the system must be at a
minimum hardware ECO Revision of 5.  If the VAX-11/750 system
has both a CI750 adapter and a UDA50 controller, the
system must be at a minimum hardware ECO Revision of 7.

If the VAX-11/750 system has a CI750 adapter and a UDA50
controller the UDA50 controller must be at REV 5.

One DR750 high performance, general purpose interface
is supported.  However the DR750 interface and the
CI750 adapter are not supported on the same system.

Appendix B

This appendix describes DIGITAL terminals, disks, tapes,
controllers, communications options, and VAXcluster options.

Terminals and Terminal Line Interfaces        
    
To prevent input from overflowing a buffer, terminals 
use the ASCII control characters DC1 and DC3 for
synchronization as defined by DIGITAL's DEC STD 111,
Revision A.

The following table lists the terminals that are
supported by VMS:  

VT52            VT100-series	VT200-series
VT300-series	LA-series	LQP02

Terminals on Professional 350, Rainbow 100, and DECmate
II systems emulate VT100 terminals.  

Only limited support is available for the VT52. 
The VT131, when running an application, operates in
block mode.  When interacting with VMS and its
associated utilities, the VT131 only operates in VT100
(or interactive) mode and not in block mode.
