PRODUCT NAME:  IXV/VAXELN Driver, Version 2.0                  SPD 29.18.01
    
DESCRIPTION

The IXV/VAXELN driver enables a user to perform I/O to/from the
IXV11/IXV1S-Modules. The driver is supplied as a subroutine library, which
the user has to include in the application software at compile and link time.
The user has then to build a bootable VAXELN system (using the VAXELN
TOOLKIT), which is booted on a target machine in order to perform its task of
a dedicated stand-alone real-time application. This type of design implies
that an application calling the driver routines must run in Kernel Mode. The
design also prohibits accessing a given device from more than one job;
however, gaining access from different processes within the same job is
possible, provided the caller ensures there is no simultaneous access to the
same device. Furthermore, the job can be used as a server enabling other jobs
on the system to access the IXV devices. 
    
The VAXELN Toolkit is a VMS layered product for the development of dedicated,
real-time VAXELN systems that  run on  VAX and MicroVAX processors.  The
development tools run on a ``host'' VAX processor under the VMS Operating
System. A finished VAXELN system using the IXV/VAXELN driver runs directly on
a ``target'' MicroVAX processor, without the presence of another operating
system. 
    
This product is supported in Europe only.

The IXV11/IXV1S Module Family is a group of industrial digital input/output,
analog input/output, and counter interfaces for DIGITAL Equipment's Q-bus
machines. 
    
These interfaces are:
    
^  Digital Input Module supported:
    
   IDV11-A/  16-bit opto-coupler                      (M5026)
   IDV1S-A   isolated digital input                   (M5026-P0)

   IDV11-B/  16-bit opto-coupler                      (M6029)
   IDV1S-B   isolated digital output                  (M6029-P0)
   IDV11-C/  16-bit relay output                      (M8005)
   IDV1S-C   16-bit relay output                      (M8005-P0)

^  Analog Input Modules supported:
   
   IAV11-A/  Isolated multi-channel                   (A410) 
   IAV1S-A   A/D converter                            (A410-P0)
   IAV11-AA/ 16 channel A/D converter                 (A410-YA)
   IAV1S-AA                                           (A410-PA)

   IAV11-C/  16 channel flying capacity               (A029)
   IAV1S-C   multiplexer for IAV11-A/IAV11-AA         (A029-P0)
   IAV11-CA/ 16 channel semiconductor                 (A029-YA)
   IAV1S-CA  multiplexer for IAV11-A/IAV11-AA         (A029-PA)
    
^  Analog Output Module supported:
    
   IAV11-B/  4 channel group                          (A6007)
   IAV1S-B   isolated D/A converter                   (A6007-P0)

^  Counter Module supported:
    
   IDV11-D/  Opto-coupler isolated                    (M7197) 
   IDV1S-D   5 channel counter                        (M7197-P0)

The IXV/VAXELN driver is functionally compatible with the respective
IXV11/VMS Driver (SPD 28.28.xx) featuring (IxV11 always implies IxV1S): 
    
^  Digital Input/Output requests support the following modes of operation:
    
   - Read data from one or several IDV1x-A modules
   - Write data to one or several IDV1x-B modules
   - Read or write fractions of a 16 bit value
   - Interrupts can be handled in a user process by 'AST' processes (the 
     AST concept is unknown to VAXELN but can be implemented using VAXELN 
     multi-tasking)
    
^  Analog Input/Output requests support the following modes of operation:
    
   - Read data from one or several (up to 128 different) channels on 
     IAV1x-A, -AA and IAV1x-C, -CA modules
   - Write data to one or several (up to 4 different) channels on IAV1x-B 
     modules
   - Automatic gain selection can be enabled
   - Multiple reads on one channel can be initiated with one request
   - Conversion can be started internally or externally
    
   Although the number of different channels is limited to 128, it is 
   possible to read each channel more than once with one request.

^  The Counter functions support the following modes of operation:
    
   - Start or stop of one or more (up to 5) counter channels simultaneously 
     on one IDV1x-D module
   - Counting in ascending or descending order may be selected per channel
   - Every channel may be preset with an initial value
   - A counter overflow and/or underflow may be handled in a user 'AST' 
     process
   - Count of external events controlled by internal or external start signal
   - Count of selectable internal time intervals upon external control 
     signal (time measurements)
   - Concatenating consecutive counter channels
