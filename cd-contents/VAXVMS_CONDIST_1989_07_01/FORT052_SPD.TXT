PRODUCT NAME:  VAX FORTRAN, Version 5.2            SPD 25.16.32

DESCRIPTION

VAX FORTRAN is an implementation of full language FORTRAN-77 conforming to 
American National Standard FORTRAN, ANSI X3.9-1978. It includes optional 
support for programs conforming to the previous standard, ANSI X3.9-1966. VAX 
FORTRAN meets the Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 
(FIPS-69-1) requirements by conforming to the ANSI Standard and by including a 
flagger. The flagger optionally produces diagnostic messages for compile-time 
elements which do not conform to the Full-Level ANSI FORTRAN X3.9-1978 
Standard. VAX FORTRAN also conforms to the International Standard ISO 
1539-1980(E). VAX FORTRAN conforms to MIL-STD 1753 with the exception of the 
specific syntax for octal and hex constants.

The shareable, reentrant compiler operates under the VMS Operating System. It 
globally optimizes source programs while taking advantage of the VAX floating 
point and character string instruction set and the VMS virtual memory system.

VAX FORTRAN includes the following enhancements to the ANSI standard:

^ Directives to support parallel decomposition of DO-loops on multiprocessor 
  VMS systems.

^ Directives to control listing page titles and subtitles, object file 
  identification field, and some attributes of common blocks

^ Composite data declarations using STRUCTURE, END STRUCTURE, and RECORD 
  statements, and access to record components through field references

^ A set of data types beyond those specified for full language FORTRAN-77:

  - LOGICAL*1, BYTE

  - LOGICAL*2

  - INTEGER*2

  - COMPLEX*16, DOUBLE COMPLEX

  - REAL*16

^ Explicit specification of storage allocation units for data types (e.g., 
  REAL*8, INTEGER*4)

^ Data initialization in type declaration statements

^ IMPLICIT NONE statement

^ INCLUDE statement

^ NAMELIST-directed I/O

^ 31-character identifiers that can include dollar sign ($) and underscore (_)

^ DO WHILE and ENDDO statements

^ Bit manipulation functions

^ Language elements for keyed and sequential access to VAX RMS 
  indexed organization files

^ Hexadecimal and octal  constants and Z and O format edit descriptors 
  applicable to all data types

^ ENCODE and DECODE statements

^ ACCEPT and TYPE input/output statements

^ DEFINE FILE statement

^ USEROPEN subroutine invocation at file OPEN time

^ Comments allowed at end of each source line

^ Debug statements in source

^ Language elements that support the VAX extended range and extended precision 
  floating point architectural features:

  -  64-bit G_floating data type, with an 11-bit exponent and 53-bit 
      mantissa, which provides a range of 0.56*10**-308 to 0.09*10**308 and a 
      precision of 15 decimal digits.

  -   128 bit H_floating data type, with a 15-bit exponent and a 113-bit 
      mantissa, which provides a range of 0.84*10**-4932 to 0.59*10**4932 and 
      a precision of 33 decimal digits

Additional Features

^ Generation of optional diagnostic messages for extensions not supported by 
  DIGITAL's ULTRIX and VAXELN operating systems.

^ Support for translation of VAX Common Data Dictionary (CDD) records into 
  FORTRAN records

^ Support for calls to VMS system service procedures 

^ Generation of symbol tables for the VAX Symbolic Debugger

^ Generation of Cross Reference Listings

^ Generation of shareable code

^ Up to 255 actual arguments in a CALL statement

^ Up to 250 named COMMON blocks per subprogram

The VAX FORTRAN compiler provides a multi-phase optimizer that is capable of 
performing optimizations across entire program units. Specific optimizations 
performed include:

^ Constant folding

^ Optimizations of arithmetic IF, logical IF, and block IF-THEN-ELSE

^ Global common subexpression elimination

^ Removal of invariant expressions from loops

^ Global allocation of general registers across program units

^ In-line expansion of statement functions

^ Optimization of array addressing in loops

^ Value propagation

^ Deletion of redundant and unreachable code

Note:	 VAX FORTRAN does not support the use of FDML statements within 
         parallel DO-loops.
