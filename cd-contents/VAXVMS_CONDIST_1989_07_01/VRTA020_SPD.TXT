PRODUCT NAME: VAX REAL-TIME ACCELERATOR SOFTWARE, Version 2.0   SPD 29.43.01

DESCRIPTION
                          
VAX REAL-TIME ACCELERATOR SOFTWARE (VAX RTA) is a VMS layered
product that integrates the VAXELN message passing capability with VMS
Operating System software.

With VAX RTA and the VAXELN Toolkit, users develop real-time applications
that can be distributed between the VMS host processor and the VAXELN-based
KA800 processors.

VAX RTA enables the VMS host processor to control the VAXELN real-time
processors using either program control or through a command language
interface.   VAXELN-based KA800 processors communicate with the VMS host
and each other at DMA speeds over the the VAXBI bus.  Communication between
processors occurs via standard VAXELN message passing services and the 
VAX RTA run-time library procedures.

VAX REAL-TIME ACCELERATOR SOFTWARE runs on the VMS Operating
System and supports the KA800 real-time processor running VAXELN.

VAX RTA Features

VAX REAL-TIME ACCELERATOR SOFTWARE improves overall system performance by
putting the computing power closer to the real-time event that is being
controlled or monitored.  This can reduce interrupt overhead and increase 
the predictability of time critical operations. 

The impact of an intensive operation on the VMS host system can be
reduced and even eliminated by distributing real-time data handling to
dedicated VAXELN VAX RTA processors. 

Communication between processors occurs using high speed DMA transfers. VAX RTA
communication services are the same for both VMS and VAXELN applications.
VAXELN ports, messages and the local name service are implemented under VAX RTA.
                                     
Each real-time processor has its own local memory for the application program,
increasing available memory for the VMS system and increasing the
performance of the real-time processor. 

Real-time applications are developed and debugged using the standard
VAXELN Toolkit.  VAXELN applications, including device drivers, can be 
developed entirely in a high level language.
