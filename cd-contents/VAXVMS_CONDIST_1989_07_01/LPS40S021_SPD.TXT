PRODUCT NAME:  VAX PrintServer 40 Supporting Host Software,    SPD 27.68.02
               Version 2.1

DESCRIPTION

The PrintServer 40 Supporting Host Software is a layered product that enables
suitably configured VMS or MicroVMS systems within a DECnet Ethernet
network to provide support functions for the PrintServer 40. 

The Supporting Host software consists of the following components:

^  The management component includes support for PrintServer 40 management, 
   down-line loading of PrintServer 40 software and remote storage of event 
   log files and the PrintServer 40 configuration database.  
       
^  The print server component which is downline loaded into the PrintServer 
   40 and includes distribution services, local server management, and the 
   PostScript(R) interpreter.  The interpreter processes PostScript commands
   and generates imaging data for the printer controller.

One Supporting Host system can support multiple PrintServer 40s on the same
Ethernet, and there may be multiple supporting hosts on the same Ethernet. 
However, only one supporting host can be active for any one PrintServer 40 at
any time. 

VAX PrintServer 40 Client Software is a companion product to this software.
Refer to SPD 27.67.xx for a description of that product. 

Features

PostScript
  
The PostScript language's page description capabilities include the following 
features, which may be used in any combination:
  
^  Arbitrary shapes constructed from straight lines, arcs, and cubic curves;
   such shapes may self-intersect and contain disconnected sections and holes.
  
^  Painting primitives that permit a shape to be outlined with lines of any 
   thickness, filled with any gray shade, or used as a clipping path to crop 
   any other graphics.
  
^  Text fully integrated with graphics.  Text characters are treated as 
   graphical shapes that may be operated on by any PostScript graphics 
   operator.

^  Sampled images derived from natural sources or generated synthetically.  
   The PostScript graphics model allows sampled images at any resolution and 
   with a variety of dynamic ranges, and it provides a number of facilities 
   to control the rendering of images on the PrintServer 40.
  
^  A general coordinate system facility that supports all combinations of 
   linear transformations including translation, scaling, rotation, 
   reflection, and skewing.  These transformations apply uniformly to all 
   elements of a page description, including text, graphical shapes, and 
   sampled images.

PrintServer 40 Management 

PrintServer 40 management services are available through a menu interface at
the local PrintServer 40 console as well as at any selected terminal on the
Supporting Host.  The management services enable the system manager to
monitor and control the functioning of the print server. There are two types
of management functions, privileged and unprivileged. To access the
privileged functions a password must be entered. 
  
Unprivileged management functions include:

^  show printer status
^  show print server characteristics
^  show job defaults
^  show queued jobs
^  show active job characteristics
  
Privileged management functions include:

^  enable/disable continuous job mode
^  show printer counters
^  set job defaults
^  set print server location
^  load/modify/save print server configuration database
^  enable/disable display of operator messages on remote console
^  select supporting host
^  enable/disable acceptance of new jobs 
^  abort jobs 
^  enable/disable event logging

Event Logging

The types of events that are logged by the PrintServer 40 range from
successful completion of jobs to fatal errors.  These events are always
displayed on the local console and can optionally be displayed on a remote
server management terminal.  These events can also be recorded in an event
log file on the supporting host.  A separate event log file is maintained for
each PrintServer 40 that is managed by the supporting host software. 
  
Down-line Load PrintServer 40 Image

The Supporting Host Software down-line loads the print server image upon
receipt of a load request from the PrintServer 40.  In the event multiple
systems on the Ethernet are running Supporting Host Software, the first
system to respond to the PrintServer 40's load request will down-line load
the print server image.  The host that loads the print server is designated
as its Supporting Host. 

Backup Supporting Host

To provide redundancy in the event of a failure of the primary Supporting
Host system, a second system can be loaded with the supporting host software
and designated as a backup supporting host. This system would be activated by
the system manager as the supporting host system only in the event of a
failure of the primary supporting host system. 

Print Server Component
  
The Print Server Component is the software that is down-line loaded to and
runs in the PrintServer 40.  This software consists of the following parts: 
  
^  Distribution Software which receives print and control data from Client
   systems or a Supporting Host system and passes the data to the Imaging
   Software.
  
^  Imaging Software interprets data from the Distribution Software, builds
   the corresponding bit maps, and sends them to the print engine. It also
   passes any system messages from the print engine, or itself to the
   Distribution Software to be returned to the appropriate Client or
   Supporting Host system.  The imaging software includes an interpreter
   based on the PostScript Page Description Language and twenty-nine 
   resident typefaces. The twenty-nine resident typefaces are as follows:
  
   - Courier
   - Courier Oblique
   - Courier Bold
   - Courier Bold Oblique
  
   - Times(R) Roman
   - Times Bold
   - Times Italic

Management Services is a menu-based user interface providing print server
management at the PrintServer 40 console.  Most of the management services
are also available from any terminal on a supporting host.
