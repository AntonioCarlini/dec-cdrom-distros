PRODUCT NAME: DECnet/SNA VMS DISOSS Document		SPD 26.72.05
	      Exchange Facility, Version 1.4

DESCRIPTION

DECnet/SNA VMS DISOSS Document Exchange Facility (DDXF) is a VMS layered 
software product which allows users of a VMS system access to the 
Distribution and Library Services of IBM's (r) Distributed Office Support 
System (DISOSS)(tm). Through the DISOSS host system the DIGITAL user may 
communicate with users of other IBM office systems, such as an IBM System 36 
with Personal Services/36, within an IBM Systems Network Architecture (SNA) 
networking environment. Access from the DIGITAL VMS system to the IBM/SNA 
network is via a DECnet/SNA Gateway or VMS/SNA software.

Through a command line interface DDXF users can access a number of functions 
by the IBM DISOSS/370 program product. A DDXF user can:

^   File a document created on the VMS system with associated profile 
    information in a DISOSS/370 host document library.

^   File profile information for an external (non-system) document in the 
    DISOSS/370 host document library.

^   Search a DISOSS/370 host document library for documents previously filed 
    by themselves or by other DISOSS/370 users including users of IBM office 
    systems such as the Displaywriter, 5520, or 8100/DOSF.

^   Retrieve documents and associated profile information to the VMS or 
    MicroVMS system from the DISOSS/370 host document library.

^   Delete owned documents filed in the DISOSS/370 host document library.

^   Update document profile information and access codes for documents filed 
    in the DISOSS/370 host document library.

^   Print a document, filed in the DISOSS/370 host document library or filed 
    locally on the VMS or MicroVMS system, on a DISOSS/370 host controlled 
    printer.

^   Distribute (send), through the DISOSS/370 host, documents and/or messages 
    to either individuals or groups that are DISOSS/370 users.

^   Obtain (receive) documents and/or messages distributed by other DISOSS/370 
    users via the DISOSS/370 host system.

^   Display status information regarding distribution requests made by DDXF to 
    the DISOSS/370 host system.

^   Allow users to change their DISOSS password from the VAX system.

^   Allow users to specify RACF identification and password for the DDXF PRINT 
    and SUBMIT DCL commands.

DDXF provides a facility to convert IBM DCA FFT (Final Form Text) files to 
DIGITAL ASCII files (using DIGITAL's Multi-National Character Set) and vice 
versa. Other DISOSS file formats may be retrieved, obtained, filed or 
distributed through the IBM host system but no conversion utilities to and 
from DIGITAL formats are provided.


INSTALLATION

DIGITAL requires that a customer's first purchase of this software product 
include DIGITAL Installation Services.  These services provide for 
installation of the software product by an experienced DIGITAL Software 
Specialist. 

For subsequent purchases of this product only experienced customers should 
attempt installation.  DIGITAL recommends that all other customers purchase 
DIGITAL's Installation Services. 

PREREQUISITE SUPPORT

A Network Profile and a DECnet Customer Support Plan (where applicable) 
covering all intended VMS or MicroVMS nodes that wish to access the 
DISOSS/370 environment must be prepared jointly by DIGITAL and the customer. 

For DDXF to be DIGITAL supported, the customer must have a DIGITAL supported 
DECnet/SNA Gateway or VMS/SNA configuration. 

To have a DIGITAL supported DECnet/SNA Gateway configuration, purchase of the 
Gateway Orientation/Installation Service is required in conjunction with the 
customer's first purchase of the DECnet/SNA Gateway. Refer to DECnet/SNA 
Gateways SPD's for further details. 

To have a DIGITAL supported VMS/SNA configuration, purchase of the VMS/SNA 
Orientation/Installation Service or equivalent thereof, is required in 
conjunction with the customer's first purchase of the VMS/SNA software.  Refer 
to VMS/SNA (SPD 27.01.xx) for further details.

Customer Responsibilities

Before installation of the software, the customer must:

^   Previously have installed all prerequisite hardware.

^   Obtain, install, and demonstrate as operational any modems and other 
    equipment and facilities necessary to interface to DIGITAL's 
    communications equipment.

^   Demonstrate equivalency of operation for modems other than Bell System 
    201C, 208A or 209A type modems or, in Europe, PTT approved modems.

^   Have generated, to DIGITAL's satisfaction, any necessary IBM host software 
    that will be communicating with either the DECnet/SNA Gateway or VMS/SNA 
    and DDXF.

^   Make available for a reasonable period of time, as mutually agreed by 
    DIGITAL and the customer, all hardware, communications facilities, and 
    terminals that are to be used during installation.

Delays caused by any failure to meet these responsibilities will be charged at 
the then prevailing rate for time and materials.

Successful use of this product requires that:

^   The customer must be prepared to work with both DIGITAL and IBM systems 
    personnel to coordinate the pre-installation activities.

^   The customer should be capable of modifying IBM component generation 
    parameters to support the DIGITAL software.
