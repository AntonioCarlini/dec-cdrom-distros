DESCRIPTION

VAX KMS11-BD/BE X.25 Link Level Software is a package of X.25 Level 2 
firmware, plus a VMS device driver for the KMS11-BD/BE X.25 Link Level 
Software. The driver, in conjunction with the X.25 Level 2 firmware and 
KMS11-BD/BE hardware, allows the VAX/VMS processor to perform high-speed 
multi-line, synchronous communication in a point-to-point environment.

The primary purpose of the driver is to allow command, control, and data 
information to and from:

^ VMS users

^ KMS11-BD/BE firmware

^ Remote end of communication line

The driver is full-duplex and maintains internal queues.

Features

^ Full-duplex operation

^ Integrated VMS Level 2 diagnostic support

^ Integrated VMS UETP (User Environment Test Program) support

^ Support of the KMS11-BD/BE hardware and X.25 link level hardware and 
  firmware

Firmware Features

The major features/functions provided by the KMS11-BD hardware and X.25 
link level firmware are:

^ X.25 link level, HDLC

^ LAPB (Link Access Procedure Balanced)

^ Modem control via KMS11-BD/BE

^ DMA for high throughput

^ Eight lines at 19.2K bps, four lines at 56K bps. Selecting 56K bps for
