PRODUCT NAME: DECnet/SNA Gateway for Channel Transport,
               Version 1.0                                  SPD 29.76.00
                 
DESCRIPTION 
  
The DECnet/SNA Gateway for Channel Transport V1.0 (DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT) is a 
member of the DECnet/SNA Gateway product family. This family consists of 
hardware and software products that allow users to bidirectionally exchange 
information and share resources between suitably configured DIGITAL systems in a
DECnet environment and IBM systems in a Systems Network Architecture (SNA) 
environment. Users on one or more DIGITAL systems can simultaneously perform 
functions such as accessing IBM application programs or other system resources,
act as a 3270 display station, perform data transfer between DIGITAL and IBM 
file systems, exchange electronic documents and mail messages, submit jobs to 
IBM batch subsystems acting as a Remote Job Entry workstation, and implement 
distributed, task-to-task, application programs that run between DIGITAL and 
IBM systems.  

The DECnet/SNA product set provides a system connecting DECnet and
SNA networks which can be used by a wide variety of DIGITAL supplied 
access routines running under VMS, MS-DOS, and ULTRIX operating environments. 
The DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT itself is managed and configured using the 
DECnet/SNA VMS Gateway Management V2.0 product. For additional information on 
the various access routines and their capabilities, please consult the OPTIONAL 
SOFTWARE section of the System Support Addendum.
 
DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT V1.0

DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT V1.0 is part of both the DECnet and the SNA networks.
Architecturally, it is a DECnet Phase IV end node to DECnet and a Physical Unit 
Type 2.0 node to SNA. It's purpose is to provide bi-directional network 
access between DECnet and SNA networks.
                                                  
The DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT hardware unit, known as the DEC ChannelServer, 
connects directly to an Ethernet Local Area Network. When used with
DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT, it provides SNA connectivity to any Phase IV 
[or Phase IV+] DECnet system in the DECnet network through the S/370 
channel. This product can be used in networks currently using 
DECnet/SNA Gateway systems and can share access routines, Ethernet 
LANs, and load host resources with those systems.

The DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT software is down-line loaded into the 
DEC ChannelServer and must be ordered in addition to the DEC ChannelServer. 
DECnet/SNA VMS Gateway Management V2.0 software is also required for the 
VMS node in the Ethernet Local Area Network designated as the load host 
for DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT. Other DECnet systems wishing access to the SNA 
environment through the DEC ChannelServer, should be configured with the 
appropriate DECnet/SNA access routine(s). 

DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT and the DEC ChannelServer support a single set of Bus 
and Tag connectors to an IBM S/370 Byte Multiplexer, Block Multiplexer, or 
Selector channel. Channel type and address may be configured according to 
rules specified in both the hardware and the software user documentation. 
 
Loading DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT V1.0 Software

The DEC ChannelServer requires software to be loaded into memory prior to 
DECnet/SNA Gateway operation. DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT software is down-line 
loaded into the DEC ChannelServer across the Ethernet Local Area Network from 
a VMS system acting as DECnet load host system.  

Most VAX, MicroVAX, and VAXstation systems running VMS or MicroVMS are
supported as Ethernet load hosts for DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT V1.0. Supported
VMS configurations are described in the System Support Addendum.

DECnet/SNA VMS Gateway Management V2.0

DECnet/SNA VMS Gateway Management V2.0 software is required on 
the VMS load host CPU used to support DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT. 
It must also be present on any other VAX node whose users want to 
manage DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT and the DEC ChannelServer. It is strongly 
recommended that the software also be installed on VMS systems where 
IBM Interconnect application programs are developed using DECnet/SNA VMS 
Programming Interface products in order to facilitate application debugging
functions.

Management of DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT should be viewed as part of the DIGITAL
environment while the management of the channel connecting the 
Gateway to the IBM system is a joint responsibility of the IBM and DIGITAL
systems managers.  (Refer to the Customer Responsibilities section at the end 
of this Software Product Description.)

the DECnet/SNA VMS Gateway Management V2.0 Software Product Description. 


New and Changed Features

This section lists the differences between DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT V1.0 and 
a wide area network based DECnet/SNA Gateway.

      ^  Higher Bandwidth -  The  DEC ChannelServer attaches directly
         to a S/370 channel offering higher bandwidth than is available 
         through the use of a synchronous SDLC circuit.
     
      ^  More Sessions - DECnet/SNA Gateway-CT supports up to 255 
         concurrent (Logical Unit) sessions for selected DECnet/SNA
         Gateway access routines.

      ^  Diagnostic Console Port - The DEC ChannelServer contains a 
         console terminal port which is used when running the DEC ChannelServer
         diagnostic routines. The use of a diagnostic console is only 
         required during installation and service of the DEC ChannelServer.

      ^  Standalone Diagnostics - The DEC ChannelServer comes with two
         diagnostic service routines to insure proper installation,
         operation, and end-to-end connections.


INSTALLATION
 
In order for this product to be DIGITAL supported, purchase of
