PRODUCT NAME:  VAX PASCAL, Version 3.9                      SPD 25.11.27  
                                                                
DESCRIPTION

VAX PASCAL is an implementation of the Pascal* language that accepts
programs compatible with either level of the ISO specification for
Programming  languages - PASCAL [ISO 7185-1983(E)] as well as
ANSI/IEEE770X3.97-1983 (December, 1983).   VAX PASCAL also meets the Federal
Information Processing Standard Publication (FIPS-109) requirements by
accepting programs conforming to the ANSI standard.

The compiler has been validated for both levels of the ISO standard and for
conforming to FIPS-109.  Containing extensions to the standards, VAX PASCAL
generates optimized, shareable code that takes full advantage of the VAX
hardware floating point and character instruction sets and the virtual
memory capabilities of the VMS Operating System.  The language contains
control statements, data types, and predeclared procedures and functions. 

Major PASCAL Language Elements

^  INTEGER, REAL, CHAR, BOOLEAN, enumerated, and subrange data types

^  ARRAY, RECORD, SET, and FILE structured data types

^  FOR, REPEAT, and WHILE repetitive control statements

^  CASE, IF-THEN, and IF-THEN-ELSE conditional statements

^  BEGIN...END compound statement

^  GOTO statement

^  GET, PUT, READ, WRITE, READLN, and WRITELN input and output procedures

^  Standard set of functions and procedures

VAX PASCAL Extensions

^  Double (D_floating or G_floating) and QUADRUPLE data types that support
   the VAX extended  range and extended precision floating point
   architectural features:

   -  64-bit D_floating data type, with an 8-bit exponent and 56-bit
      mantissa, which provides a range of 0.29*10**-38 to 1.7*10**38 and a
      precision of 16 decimal digits

   -  64-bit G_floating data type, with an 11-bit exponent and 53-bit
      mantissa, which provides a range of 0.56*10**-308 to 0.09*10**308 and
      a precision of 15 decimal digits

   -  128-bit H_floating data type, with a 15-bit exponent and a 113-bit
      mantissa, which provides a range of 0.84*10**-4932 to 0.59*10**4932
      and a precision of 33 decimal digits

*  K. Jensen and N. Wirth, ``Pascal User Manual and Report'', 2nd. 
   ed., Spring-Verlag, New York 1974.

^  VARYING data type denoting variable-length character strings up to
   65,535 characters

^  Concatenation operator and set of predefined character string functions
   including INDEX, LENGTH, and SUBSTR

^  Language elements providing sequential and random access to VAX RMS
   relative files and sequential and keyed access to VAX RMS multikey
   indexed files

^  Optional attributes specification on types, type identifiers, routines,
   and compilation units

^  MODULE capability for combining procedures, functions, and other
   declarations for compilation separate from the main program

^  ENVIRONMENT and INHERIT attributes to control separate and independent
   compilation

^  UNSIGNED and SINGLE predefined types

^  VALUE initialization section and optional value initialization in
   declaration section program level

^  Exponentiation operator (**)

^  OTHERWISE clause for CASE statement

^  Binary, hexadecimal, and octal constants

^  External procedure and function declarations

^  Nonpositional passing of parameters

^  Default values for parameters

^  Ability for functions to return structured types (other than file types)

As a native-mode VAX language, VAX PASCAL is integrated into the VAX Common
Language Environment.  This integration provides VAX PASCAL users with:

^  Support for VAX interlanguage calling standard

^  Access to all VMS system services

^  Access to the facilities of the VAX Symbolic Debugger

^  VAX Language-Sensitive Editor support

^  Callable interfaces to the VAX Common Run-time Library

^  Callable interfaces to VAX utilities, such as SORT and to  optional
   products, for example VAX DATATRIEVE

^  VAX Common Data Dictionary Support

^  VAX Source Code Analyzer Support                                            

^  31-character identifiers that can include dollar sign ($) and underscore
   (_)

Options available to VAX PASCAL users at compile time include:

^  Run-time checks for array, character string, and subrange bounds

^  Run-time checks for arithmetic overflow, valid case selector values, and
   null pointer variables

^  Generation of information  for  use by the VAX Symbolic Debugger and the
   run-time error traceback mechanism

^  Creation of an environment file facilitating separate compilation

^  Cross-reference listing

^  Creating in the listing file a representation of the object code
   generated by the compiler

^  Printing of information-level messages, flagging uses VAX PASCAL
   extensions to the ISO and ANSI standard.
