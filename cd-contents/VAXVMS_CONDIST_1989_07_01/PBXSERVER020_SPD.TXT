PRODUCT NAME :   PBXserver v2.0         SPD 29-23-01


DESCRIPTION:

     The PBXserver is an ETHERNET based terminal server.  It links  to
     digital  PBXes  via  a European-standard 30-channel interface and
     allows terminals connected to a terminal adapter/telephone set to
     use  VAX/VMS host services on Ethernet through the PBX and its 
     associated building wiring.

     The  interface  between  the  PBXserver  and  the  PBX  runs   at
     2.048Mbps;  it  is called "ECMA S2" interface, based on the "ISDN
     primary   rate   interface,   30B+D",   and   carries   30   data
     communications simultaneously.  It is fully described by a set of
     ECMA standards, based on CCITT recommendation for ISDN, as listed
     in Appendix A.

     The terminal user has to establish a connection to the  PBXserver
     by  "dialling  in" through the terminal adapter/telephone set and
     the PBX.  Once he is connected to the PBXserver,  he  has  the
     same  general functionality  as a user of the DECserver terminal 
     servers and can manage several sessions on several services.
     Note that the "dial-in" procedure is PBX-specific.

     The PBXserver also allows for VMS host-initiated connections to      
     asynchronous printers. This allows the printers to be distributed 
     throughout a facility through the PBX's ports and accessed 
     transparently by service node users. Incoming host-initiated connect
     requests may be queued FIFO at the PBXserver. 

     The interest of using a PBX for terminal access  to  services  on
     Ethernet  is,  obviously,  to  have  a higher number of POTENTIAL
     users than ACTUAL users; a concentration factor  of  between  5:1
     and  3:1  is reasonable for an office environment.  Thus, with 30
     data communications supported by  the  ECMA  S2  link,  typically
     90..150 occasional users can be supported.

     The  PBXserver  software  is  down-line  loaded  into   PBXserver
     hardware  from  a  uVAX/VAX/VMS  host  system running DECnet/VAX.
     Then, users may access Ethernet-based  VAX/VMS host  services  via
     LAT protocol.




     Two types of user interfaces are provided:

     1.  to the terminal user,

     2.  to the privileged user (= system manager)

     1/Terminal User Interface

     The  user  first  has  to  "dial   in"   through   the   terminal
     adapter/telephone   set   and  the  PBX.   Once  the  circuit  is
     established, he enters the LOCAL mode of the PBXserver.

     In LOCAL mode, the user may

      *  DISPLAY the  list  of  authorized  host  services  and  their
         shortnames;

      *  CONNECT to any authorized VAX/VMS host service on ETHERNET ,setting
         up for each terminal up to 8 sessions at the same time;

      *  RESUME a session which has been interrupted by using the BREAK key;

      * SHOW SESSION list the current sessions

      *  BACKWARD, FORWARD select a session

      *  DISCONNECT from the session

      *  SET and SHOW terminal parameters, and retain them;

      *  COMMUNICATE to a host service, once it is connected,  through
         the Local Area Transport (LAT) architecture.

      *  obtain HELP for the user commands.

      *   LOGOUT to break the connections with the PBXserver and the PBX.

     Once connected to a host service, the user is  in  SERVICE  mode.
     In  SERVICE  mode,  the  user  may work with any application in a
     transparent manner.  He may interrupt a session  with  the  BREAK
     key , create another session or DISCONNECT from the current service.

     2/Privileged User Interface

     An interface to a privileged operator is provided, in order to

      *  SET and SHOW  terminal and printer ports parameters, and retain them;

      *  SET and SHOW  PBXserver parameters, and retain them;

      *  SHOW PBXserver statistical informations;

      *  DISCONNECT all terminals;

      *  PERFORM PBX maintenance functions;

      *  MANAGE the PBXserver;

      *  DEFINE the line characteristics, service shortnames

      *  obtain HELP for the privileged commands.



     
     Terminals Supported

     1/Terminal Characteristics

     The PBXserver supports the simultaneous operation  of  up  to  30
     asynchronous  terminals,  including  keyboard send-receive (KSR-)
     printers and PC's.

     Supported asynchronous terminal characteristics are as follows:

      *  7 or 8 data bits;

      *  1 or 2 stop bits;

      *  Parity:  Even, odd, or none;

      *  Speeds:  75, 300, 600, 1200, 2400,  4800,  9600,  19200  bps.
         



                                   NOTE

             This  product  is  not   warranted   to   support
             non-DIGITAL   terminal   devices   and   Personal
             Computers.  However, those supporting  VT100-like
             characteristics may operate with this product.
	     This product does not support simultaneously 8 data bits 
    	     and parity check



     2/DIGITAL Terminals Supported
    
       Video Terminals


      *  VT100, VT101, VT102, VT125, VT131;

      *  VT220, VT240, VT241;

      *  VT320, VT330, VT340.


       Hardcopy Terminals (KSR Printers)


      *  LA100, LA120 as KSR "...writers"



       PC's


      *  DECMATE II, III and III+;

      *  Rainbow 100B, Rainbow 100+;

      *  Professional 325/350/380;

      *  VAXmate.


                                   NOTE

             These PC's are supported both in VT100  emulation
             mode  and in block mode file transfer mode at a 
             maximum speed of 9600 bps. working in file transfer
	     mode  must  be permanently  set  to  8  bit  characters
	     without parity




     Additional features 

      *  XON/XOFF flow control between terminal and the PBXserver.  It
         may be dynamically enabled or disabled;

      *  Switching to different host services from the LOCAL prompt of
         the  PBXserver  without  having  to  re-dial  the  connection
         through the PBX;

      *  Access control, by group codes limiting accessibility of 
         certain  hosts  to terminals; 

      *  Direct Inward Dialing through the PBX for fast connection  to
         a host service;


*3/DIGITAL Printers Supported

     The PBXserver software support all the DIGITAL asynchronous
     serial (RS-232c) printers when accessed from VAX/VMS and MicroVMS systems
     using XON/XOFF protocol.


     Restrictions On PBXserver Usage

     *Due to an Xoff maximum delay of 60 ms in the PBXserver it is  recommended
     to  set VT100 terminals to 2400 bps in order to avoid the risk of
     data loss.
    
     *The  throughput of the PBXserver may be degraded when the number of
     host services is more  than 8 and/or too many terminals or printers work 
     at 19200 baud. Depending on the configuration the privileged command 
     DEFINE SERVER or SET SERVER allows the user to tune PBXserver by modifying  
     the maximum number of allowed terminals and the maximum  number  of 
     host services. 

     **The PBXserver support up to 8 sessions by terminal and up to 6 printers
	queuing up to 40 requests.
