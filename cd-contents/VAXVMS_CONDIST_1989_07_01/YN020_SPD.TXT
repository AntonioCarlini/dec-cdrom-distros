PRODUCT NAME:	VAX KMS11-BD/BE HDLC/BSC             SPD 26.55.04
		Framing Software, Version 2.0

DESCRIPTION

The VAX KMS11-BD/BE HDLC/BISYNC (BSC) Framing Firmware consists of a VMS 
software driver and firmware for the KMS11-BD/BE.  The VMS software driver 
and the KMS11-BD/BE software allow VMS users to build and implement custom 
or standard communication protocol without having to program the KMS11-BD/BE.

The KMS11-BD/BE firmware provides the HDLC or BISYNCH (BSC) framing of the 
data, as well as the DMA between the KMS11-BD/BE and VAX host.  This capability
reduces the host of processor overhead associated with character interrupt 
devices.  The VAX host is no longer interrupted on each character that is 
transmitted or received and does not have the software overhead associated with 
determining what to do with each character as it is received or transmitted.  
Rather, an interrupt is generated on a message transmitted or received basis 
and processing then takes place on the entire message.

The driver is the interface that allows the user to transmit or receive 
command, control or message data between VMS users, the KMS11-BD/BE 
firmware, and the remote end of the communication line.  The VMS software 
driver for the KMS11-BD/BE provides the interface which allows the VMS 
user to send or receive messages, for various protocols in the VMS host.  
These messages are then sent or received via DMA from the KMS11-BD/BE 
HDLC/BISYNCH Framing Software.

The purpose of the KMS11-BD/BE firmware is to provide the basic HDLC or 
BISYNCH line framing of the messages received or to be transmitted from the 
VAX host using a DMA Device.  It is the responsibility of a host application 
program (not supplied with this software) to provide the protocol line 
control.  This program may be written in a higher level language which is 
supported on VMS systems.
