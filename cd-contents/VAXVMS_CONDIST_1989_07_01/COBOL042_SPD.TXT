PRODUCT NAME:  VAX COBOL, Version 4.2                          SPD 25.04.20
                                                                

DESCRIPTION:

VAX COBOL is a high level language for business data processing that operates
under the VMS Operating System, taking full advantage of the system
facilities and the VAX Information Architecture. It is based upon the 1985
ANSI COBOL Standard X3.23-1985. 

VAX COBOL shares some common syntax with COBOL-81/RSTS/E and COBOL-81/RSX and
includes a COBOL-81 subset flagger.  It is integrated with the VAX 
Information Architecture and includes various DIGITAL extensions to COBOL,
including screen handling at the source language level. 

VAX COBOL has been validated by the National Bureau of Standards for
conformance to ``FIPS PUB 21-2, Federal Standard COBOL'' at the high level. 

Two features provide access to the VAX Information Architecture from VAX
COBOL.  The Data Manipulation Language (DML) allows users to access DBMS
databases with VAX DBMS.  VAX DBMS must be installed to use this feature. The
COPY FROM DICTIONARY statement, a DIGITAL extension to COBOL, allows access
to common record definitions stored in the VAX Common Data Dictionary (CDD).
The VAX CDD or VAX CDD/Plus must be installed to use this feature. 

VAX COBOL, COBOL-81/RSTS/E and COBOL-81/RSX share many common features. These
features are implemented with the same syntax and semantics on both
compilers. In this way, a VMS system may be used to develop code that will
eventually be compiled  using COBOL-81. A COBOL-81 subset flagger may be used
to check code designed for eventual use on COBOL-81.  Additionally, code
developed using COBOL-81 may be migrated to VAX COBOL. 

The following DIGITAL extensions to COBOL are implemented in VAX COBOL:

^  Screen handling is implemented using the DISPLAY and ACCEPT statements. 
   The DISPLAY statement enables the programmer to display information or 
   prompts anywhere on a video screen. The ACCEPT statement takes information 
   typed anywhere on the screen and returns the value to a running VAX COBOL 
   program.  The DISPLAY statement converts data from internal numeric format 
   to ``ASCII display format''; and the ACCEPT WITH CONVERSION statement 
   converts ``ASCII display'' input characters to internal numeric formats as 
   appropriate.  The terminal-type is recognized at run-time from 
   information provided by the operating system.

^  RMS-STS and RMS-STV special registers may be examined to assist debugging.
   These registers contain status values from the Record Management System
   (VAX RMS).

^  File sharing and record locking features enable more than one user to
   access data at the same time.

^  Conditional compilation serves to make debugging easier.

VAX COBOL implements several statements designed to make programming easier
in the VMS environment: 

^  VALUE IS EXTERNAL - Access to link time constants

^  USAGE IS POINTER - Address data type

^  VALUE IS REFERENCE - Compile time address evaluation

^  SET TO REFERENCE - Run-time address evaluation

^  SUCCESS/FAILURE - Class conditions

Other extensions include:

^  Thirty-one character user-names

^  ACCEPT AT END statement

^  Single-quote-delimited non-numeric literals

^  Hyphen/underscore equivalence in user-names

^  Non-numeric literal argument passing

The VAX COBOL compiler produces an object module from a source program. The
compiler is capable of producing a source listing with embedded diagnostics
indicating the line and position of a source-code error, a machine language
listing, a file-name map, a data-name map, a procedure-name map, an external
program name map, subschema information and a cross-reference listing. The
cross-reference listing and maps may be produced in either alphabetical order
or in order of declaration. The cross-reference listing distinguishes
destructive references to data from read-only references. 

Object modules produced by the compiler can be linked with other object
modules produced by many other languages, including VAX BASIC and VAX 
FORTRAN. VAX COBOL is supported by both the VAX Common Run-Time Library (VAX
RTL) and the VAX Symbolic Debugger. 

The VAX COBOL product includes a COBOL compiler and  the REFORMAT Utility.
The REFORMAT Utility converts source programs from DIGITAL terminal format to
ANSI-standard COBOL format and vice versa.
