PRODUCT NAME: VAX KCT32, Version 2.0 	                     SPD 26.04.03


DESCRIPTION

VAX KCT32 is a software and firmware package that provides VMS support 

for the KCT32 hardware communication option. VAX KCT32 software, in 

conjunction with the KCT32 firmware and KCT32 hardware, allows the user to 

implement custom communication applications.

Users can program the KCT32 communication lines for bit/byte synchronous 

or asynchronous transmission and reception using the standard DIGITAL 

PDP-11 Instruction Set, as implemented with the DCT11 chip. This software 

used with the KCT32 hardware and user written communication application 

allows the VMS host processor to perform high speed (two lines at 64K 

baud in bit sync mode, or one line at 130K baud in bit sync mode) multiline 

communication functions.


Software Features

^  VMS General Purpose driver which allows the VMS host application 

   to pass command, control, and message data to/from the:

	 - VMS user
	 - KCT32 user written communication application
	 - Remote end of the communication lines

^  Down-line loading of the KCT32 user developed communication application

^  KCT32 status and statistics

^  Full-duplex Driver operation

^  UETP (User Environment Test Program)

^  IVP (Installation Verification Program) for the KCT32 VMS driver

^  Integrated support of the UETP, IVP, and level 2R diagnostic in the 

   VMS driver

The driver is full duplex, maintains internal queues, and will support 
up to four KCT32s concurrently.


Firmware Features

The KCT32 firmware consists of system support modules upon which users can 

build and debug custom communication applications. The support modules 

consist of:

^  KCT32 executive for control of modules and application interfaces

^  Modem control interface

^  Baud rate generator interface

^  CSR interface

^  Timer functions

^  KCT32 front-end I/O processor interface (the KCT32 has a second onboard 

   microprocessor for dedicated control of the communication lines)

^  KCT32 ODT type, Debugger Interface for debugging user applications

^  DMA interfaces for high throughput to/from the KCT32 VAX host and
   to/from the KCT32 and its onboard I/O processor

^  Onboard selectable interface for RS422/449, RS423, RS232
