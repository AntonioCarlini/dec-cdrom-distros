DESCRIPTION

VAX/EDI is a VMS layered application which provides the facilities 
necessary for Electronic Data Interchange(EDI). It enables end-users to 
electronically exchange business documents such as 'Orders' and 
'Invoices' with their trading partners. It implements the TRADACOMS EDI 
standard (Update-4, 1st August 1987) as defined by the Article Numbering 
Association (ANA) (tm). 

It also provides all the facilities necessary to interwork with the 
TRADANET EDI service to enable end-users to communicate with their 
trading partners. The TRADANET EDI service is accessed via British 
Telecom's Packet Switchstream (PSS)(tm) through the use of VAX P.S.I.

VAX/EDI consists of the following components:


	*   A set of user-callable routines, to allow end-users to link 
            existing or new applications to VAX/EDI. These routines 
            are used to

		-   post data from the application to VAX/EDI for 
                    translation to the TRADACOMS(tm) format prior to 
		    transmission to the EDI service. 

		-   fetch data, received in TRADACOMS(tm) format from the 

		    EDI network by VAX/EDI, for processing by the 
                    application, once the format has been converted to 
                    that required by the application.

        *   An implementation of the TRADACOMS (tm) EDI Standard
	    (TRADACOMS Update-4) to translate outgoing documents into
	    TRADACOMS(tm) format and to convert incoming documents from 
	    the TRADACOMS(tm) format to that required by the application.

	*   A communications component which provides the full set 
            of commands required to interwork with the TRADANET EDI
	    service.      	
 	
	*   An administrator's interface which allows a designated user 
            to maintain the VAX/EDI system, adjust system parameters 
            and perform any error recovery which may be necessary.

	*   A supervisor's interface which allows designated users to 
            monitor the status of the documents in the VAX/EDI system 
            via a menu driven interface.

In addition the following set of tools is also provided:

        *   A syntax specific editor to enable the user to configure the 
	    VAX/EDI formatting tables. The VAX/EDI formatting tables are 
            used to translate the application data to TRADACOMS(tm) 
            format and vice versa.

	*   A tool to carry out the certification tests specified by the 
	    TRADANET EDI service for gaining approval to connect to the 
            Service and to check the operational status of VAX/EDI. The 
            tests are carried out in three stages and consist of : 
            
	    	-   Stage-1  tests the network access to the TRADANET EDI
	            Service.
	    
	    	-   Stage-2 exercises the full set of network commands to
                    ensure correct interworking with the TRANADET EDI 
	    	    Service.

	    	-   Stage-3 performs full system verification by sending 
                    and receiving test data in TRADACOMS(tm) format to
	    	    and from the EDI Network.
