PRODUCT NAME: VAX Computer Integrated Telephony Applications 
              Interface (VAX CIT Applications Interface)
              Version 1.1                              SPD 29.92.01


DESCRIPTION

The VAX Computer Integrated Telephony Applications Interface
(CIT Applications Interface) is a software product which provides
programmers with an applications interface comprising a library
of VMS routines. These routines enable the programmer to initiate
features and monitor the status of telephones connected to a PBX. 

VAX CIT Applications Interface routines comply with the VMS Standard for
Procedure Calling and Condition Handling, and so present a familiar
interface to VMS applications programmers. 

The CIT routines allow the applications programmer to establish and 
control logical communications channels between a VAX and the 
associated PBX.  These channels can be used for basic call
processing, such as making and accepting telephone calls, and for 
additional call processing such as transfer calls and conference 
calls.

VAX CIT Applications Interface is client software that provides the
high-level interface for applications programmers, passing the
application's requests to DIGITAL'S VAX CIT Server software.  

In order for CIT Applications Interface to be of use, a customer
must also install DIGITAL'S VAX CIT Server (SPD 29.91.xx)
software within the DECnet system.
