 PRODUCT NAME:  DECtrace for OpenVMS, Version 2.1       SPD 25.G1.04

 DESCRIPTION

 DECtrace is an OpenVMS layered product that collects and reports on
 event-based data and provides on-line capabilities to view performance
 data in real-time. This data is useful for performance analysis, ca-
 pacity planning, database tuning, error logging, and other areas in
 which detailed event performance information on applications and lay-
 ered products is needed. DECtrace event data can be gathered from any
 OpenVMS layered product or combination of products that contain DEC-
 trace service routine calls. Customers can also put DECtrace event calls
 in their application code to collect application-specific event and
 performance data. DECtrace is designed to operate with minimal per-
 formance impact on the system and can be used in both development and
 production environments. DECtrace supports both single-node and VM-
 Scluster environments.

 A DECtrace event is defined to be an application-defined occurrence.
 An event can have a start and an end (duration event) or can simply
 occur (point event). DECtrace allows events within layered products
 or customer application programs to be defined and data items to be
 associated with each event. These data items can be resource utiliza-
 tion statistics (for example, CPU time) or other application-defined
 items (for example, text strings). Data items specific to the Digi-
 tal layered product, third-party layered product, or customer appli-
 cation can be associated with each event. In addition, event data can
 be tracked across product boundaries. So, for example, performance data
 about a VAX ACMS procedure call can be related to the DEC Rdb for OpenVMS
 (DEC Rdb) events that execute on behalf of that procedure call. These
 data items defined with DECtrace can be used for supporting database

 tuning, application-level error logging, application transaction per-
 formance data, and a range of other information logging needs.

 DECtrace enables the user to graphically display ACMS, Rdb, or other
 application performance event data in real-time. Performance data to
 be viewed is selected from many menu choices. The user can set thresh-
 olds on this data to be alerted of potential performance problems.

 DECtrace provides detail, summary, and frequency reports based upon
 the formatted event data in the DECtrace DEC Rdb database. Since the
 event data can be stored in a DEC Rdb database or an RMS file, users
 can write customized reports using DATATRIEVE, DECdecision, DEC RALLY,
 other 4GL tools, or standard 3GL languages such as COBOL. The DECtrace
 formatted DEC Rdb database definitions can optionally be stored in 
 CDD/Repository for VMS. DECtrace event data can also be used by other
 applications such as DEC RdbExpert, which optimizes the performance of 
 DEC Rdb databases and ALL-IN-1 Performance Reports, which generates 
 reports from ALL-IN-1 data collected by DECtrace.

 DECtrace is an event-based data collector rather than sample-based;
 it collects data at defined locations in the application code each time
 that the code is executed.

 DECtrace does not attempt to analyze or modify the performance of an
 application. Its function is to collect, and report or display the event
 data. Interpreting the reports is the responsibility of the user. De-
 scriptions of the DECtrace data is provided in the documentation for
 these products. For a current list of supported layered products, re-
 fer to the OPTIONAL SOFTWARE section of this SPD.

 DECtrace software components are available on OpenVMS VAX and Open-
 VMS AXP systems. These components may be used on a single system or
 distributed across several systems. Components on VAX and AXP systems
 are interoperable. For example, DECtrace Reporter on an OpenVMS AXP
 system can be used to report data collected by the DECtrace Collec-
 tor on an OpenVMS VAX system.

 Features

 DECtrace allows application or layered product software developers to:

 o  Define events and data items specific to their software.

 o  Place DECtrace service routine calls at appropriate locations in
    the program source code. These locations are determined by the type
    of information to be collected and the way it will be used and in-
    terpreted by the user. (DECtrace provides a Language Sensitive Ed-
    itor template to aid in the coding process.)

 o  Register these application programs with DECtrace.

 Users of DECtrace data may be applications developers, applications
 performance analysts, database administrators, system managers, ca-
 pacity planners, and others interested in event or performance data.
 The DECtrace user can:

 o  Display information about facilities and collections.

 o  Generate real-time displays of collected data while applications
    are running.

 o  Collect event data and format it into a DEC Rdb database or RMS file.

 o  If CDD/Repository for VMS is installed on the system, DECtrace can
    record the formatted DEC Rdb database definitions into CDD/Repository
    for VMS.

 o  Collect data from single and multi-user test and production envi-
    ronments allowing one or more collections per node to be active at
    any given time.

 o  Turn data collection on and off from the command line interface.

 o  Merge data from different collection instances.

 o  Track event data across facility (product) boundaries.

 o  Produce detail, frequency, and summary reports from the DEC Rdb for-
    matted database.

    file using 3GL or 4GL language products.


 Product Licenses

 The DECtrace product set consists of two software components: DECtrace
 Full and DECtrace Collector. DECtrace Full includes the following com-
 ponents:

 o  DECtrace Collector

    The DECtrace Collector contains a set of service routines; calls
    to these services are placed within the layered application soft-
    ware and represent the application events. Data is collected on these
    events and stored for subsequent use by the DECtrace Reporter. The
    DECtrace Collector provides a library of service routine calls with
    the ability to:

    -  Register facilities

    -  Create selection definitions

    -  Schedule collections and collect data

    -  Register each layered product and application (called facili-
       ties)

    -  Selectively consolidate data from one or more of these facil-
       ities

    -  Display information about these facilities and about the col-
       lected data

 o  DECtrace Monitor

    The DECtrace Monitor provides the ability to display application
    performance data. DECtrace Collector is required for real-time dis-
    plays (not required for replay). Through the command line inter-
    face, the user can perform the following functions:

    -  View real-time Motif[R] displays

    -  Replay previous collections

 o  DECtrace Reporter

    The DECtrace Reporter product provides the formatting and report-
    ing functions. Through the command line interface, the user can per-
    form the following functions:

    -  Format the data into either a DEC Rdb database or an RMS file

    -  Create reports using the DECtrace reporting mechanism

 The DECtrace Collector license includes only the Collector component
 described above.

 Recognized standards do not exist for products that collect and re-
 port system event.

 Unless otherwise noted, these counts refer to the disk space required
 on the system disk. The sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary
 depending on the user's system environment, configuration, and soft-
 ware options selected.

 Additional disk space will be required for DECtrace data collection
 files, formatted data and/or database files. This space is not required
 on the system disk. The amount of additional space required is depen-
 dent on the amount of information collected and formatted using DEC-
 trace, and will vary from collection to collection.

 Memory Requirements for DECwindows Support

 The Monitor facility is a DECwindows application. The minimum supported
 memory for this application running in a standalone DECwindows envi-
 ronment with both the client and server executing on that same sys-
 tem is 8 Mbytes on VAX processors and 8 Mbytes on AXP processors.

 CLUSTER ENVIRONMENT

 This layered product is fully supported when installed on any valid
 and licensed VAXcluster or VMSCluster configuration without restric-
 tions. The HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS sections of this product's Software
 Product Description detail any special hardware required by this prod-
 uct.

 VAXcluster configurations are described in the VAXcluster Software Prod-
 uct Description (29.78.xx). VMScluster configurations are described
 in the VMScluster Software Product Description (42.18.xx). These con-
 figurations include CI, Ethernet, and Mixed Interconnect configura-
 tions.
