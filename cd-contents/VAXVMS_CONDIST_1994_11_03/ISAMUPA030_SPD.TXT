 PRODUCT NAME:  DECimage Scan Software for VMS,         SPD 25.D4.03
                Version 3.0

 DESCRIPTION

 DECimage Scan Software is a DECwindows Motif[TM] application for the
 capture, adjustment and delivery of bitonal (black and white), grayscale
 and color images. It allows users to setup and control supported Im-
 age Scanners. Other capabilities include scan, preview, adjustment of
 images, reading and creating DDIF image files, and mailing image files.
 Files created using DECimage Scan Software can be used by other ap-
 plications that operate on image files in DDIF (Digital's Document In-
 terchange Format).

 DECimage Scan Software can be invoked from DECwrite, VMS and DECpre-
 sent for VAX/VMS, allowing images to be scanned directly into documents

 DECimage Scan Software invokes the optional DECimage Character Recog-
 nition Software for VMS, Version 1.1 providing OCR capability.

 DECimage Scan Software supports the MD300, MD400, MD410, and MD30C Im-
 age Scanners. The MD300 scanner requires connection to a Q-bus based
 VAX or VAXstation. The MD400, MD410 and MD30C scanners require con-
 nection to a VAXstation 3100. DECimage Scan Software provides access
 from any workstation running DECwindows Motif (VMS or ULTRIX) to a scan-
 ner connected to a remote node within a DECnet LAN.

 Features

 Scanner Selection - Allows the user to select either a local or re-
 mote scanner including the MD300, MD400, MD410 or MD30C as well as a
 variety of scanner features including Automatic Document Feeder, En-
 dorser, and H/W compression.

 File Functions
 eightpointss

 Open As     Allows the user to specify a DDIF encoded image file
             as input for preview and edit (uncompressed bitonal,
             grayscale, and RGB color or compressed CCITT Group
             III, Group IV, or DCT).

 Save As     Delivers the DDIF encoded image to a file. The image
             may be stored either locally or remotely. DECimage
             Scan Software allows the user to specify either DECim-
             age Application Services, Version 2.0 or Version 3.0
             file formats. The default is Version 2.0.

 Print       Allows the user to send an image in memory to a se-
             lected print queue.

 Mail To     Allows the user to mail DDIF images to a local or
             remote DECwindows Mail user.

 Edit Functions
 eightpointss

 Undo        Allows the user to "undo" the last image adjustment.

 Modify      Allows the user to:
 Region

             Crop - Allows selection of a rectangular region of the
             original image and deletes the remainder.

             Wash - Allows selection of a rectangular region of
             the original image that can be set to all white or all
             black.

             Reverse - Allows selection of a rectangular region
             of the original image and inverts the pixel values
             within the region (white to black and black to white).
             Grayscale and color images can also be reversed.

 Scale       Enables the user to select a scale parameter to be ap-
             plied to the image during the render process. Options
             include:

             - No scale
             - Scale using specified values
             - Scale image to fit entire display
             - Scale image to fit width of display
             - Scale image to fit length of display
             - Fill (flood) entire display area with image

 Rotate      Rotates the entire image by a specified angle from
             -360 to +360 degrees.

 Flip        Allows the user to flip the image either horizontally,
             around the x-axis, or vertically, around the y-axis.

 Contrast    Allows the user to manipulate brightness and con-
 Brightness  trast of an image. The brightness adjustment causes an
             arithmetic addition for all pixel values in an image,
             depending on the percent being applied. For gray scale
             images, contrast adjustment allows a user to darken
             shadows, increase contrast, and brighten highlights.

 Image       Provides the user with the ability to perform spectral
 Characteristconversion of images, dither an image, perform bitonal
             thresholding, or apply smoothing algorithms to enhance
             an image.

 Clipboard   Allows the user to:
             - CUT
             - COPY
             - PASTE
             selected regions of an image being viewed.

 Clear       Allows the user to either clear image in the viewing
             window or clear the image in the viewing window and
             purge the image from memory.
