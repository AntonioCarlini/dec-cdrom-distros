 PRODUCT NAME:  DECimage Application Services for VMS, Version 3.2 SPD
 25.E8.04

 DESCRIPTION

 DECimage Application Services for VMS provides an application program-
 ming interface (API) and programming tools for a family of image cap-
 ture, processing, and display services. Services are grouped into the
 following sets:

 Image       Image scanner device drivers, device setup, and image
 Input       data acquisition
 Services
 (IIS)
 Image       Image datatype support, file I/O, image processing and
 Services    manipulation, data encoding conversion
 Library
 (ISL)
 Image       Device independent image rendition control, image
 Display     display, and X Image Extension support
 Services
 (IDS)
 X Image     Extension to the X Core protocol for communicating im-
 Extensions  age resource request with an X Image Server Extension
 (XIE)

 DECimage Application Services is language independent and is intended
 to enable application developers and systems integrators to handle bitonal,
 grayscale (photographic), and RGB (red, green, blue) color image data.
 DECimage Application Services offers a consistent interface that con-
 forms to the VAX-11 Procedure Calling and Condition Handling Standard
 and MIT C bindings and routine names for source code transportabil-
 ity. Examples are provided in C, BASIC, FORTRAN, PASCAL, ADA, and PL
 /1.

                               DIGITAL                 November 1993

                                                         AE-MI21E-TE

 

 DECimage Application Services supports CCITT, Group III (1D and 2D),
 and Group IV (2D) (CCITT Standards T.4 and T.6) recommendations for
 bitonal (facsimile) image data compression schemes and DCT continu-
 ous tone image data compression. It also supports the X Window Sys-
 tem[TM] standard, DECwindows, Motif[R], and the PostScript[R] Language
 Reference industry standard. It complies with Digital's Document In-
 terchange Format (DDIF).

 DECimage Application Services features a condition handling facility
 (CHF) to provide error signaling that is portable between OpenVMS and
 ULTRIX. CHF provides one common interface for both OpenVMS and ULTRIX
 applications and includes messaging support services.

 The features included in each set of image services are listed below.

 Image Input Services (IIS)

 o  Device drivers for the MD400 and MD410 image scanners.

 o  Assign/deassign local or remote image input device, reserving the
    device for exclusive use and then releasing the device. This in-
    cludes support for remote node access and mixed OpenVMS and ULTRIX
    scanner environments.

 o  Get, set, and reset the device attributes.

 o  Read image data synchronously from the device and combine the data
    with the image attributes to create and deliver an image frame to
    the application.

 o  Acquire image data synchronously or asynchronously from the device
    to a specified buffer that has been preallocated by the applica-
    tion.

 o  Cancel asynchronous image data acquisition.

 Image Services Library (ISL)

 o  Frame services

    -  Create/delete image frame in memory

    -  Allocate/free/deallocate/store data plane in buffer

                                  2

 

    -  Get/set single image and image frame attributes

 o  Import/export bitmap to/from application buffer

 o  Create/delete region of interest within a frame for processing

 o  Formatting services

    -  Open/close a DDIF file

    -  Create/delete a DDIF stream for reading or writing

    -  Import/export a DDIF frame

    -  Export DDIF page break (hard or soft) into a DDIF stream or file

    -  Export bitonal sixel or PostScript format

    -  Compress/decompress bitonal image data using CCITT, Group III
       (1D and 2D), and Group IV (2D) facsimile compression schemes

    -  Compress/decompress grayscale and color image data using a DCT
       compression scheme

 o  Domain adjustment

    -  Copy all or portion of image into new image frame

    -  Dither or reduce the bits per pixel

    -  Flip or mirror the image, horizontally and/or vertically

    -  Rotate the image around the Z axis

    -  Scale or change the dimensions of the image

 o  Image operator services

    -  Combine (16 logical point operations)

    -  Filters for enhancement, edge detection, and noise reduction

    -  Pixel remapping based on look-up tables or remapping functions
       provided by the programmer

    -  Tone scale adjustment to enhance contrast

                                  3

 

 o  Statistical services

    -  Create/delete histogram of intensities for in-memory image

 o  Image processing primitive services

    -  General purpose convolution engine for filtering functions

 Image Display Services (IDS)

 o  Services for display of images on DECwindows workstations, DECwin-
    dows terminals, and supported hardcopy devices

 o  Rendition of bitonal, continuous-tone monochrome, and continuous-
    tone RGB color images

 o  DECwindows XUI and Motif image widgets with scroll bars to render
    and display an image or portion of an image and to interactively
    roam through the image

 o  Widget creation routines and tools

 o  Manage sharing of colors and grayscale shades between applications

 o  Color sixel output for the LJ250 color printer

 o  Transparent utilization of X Image Server Extension capabilities,
    if available, via X Image Extension protocol

 X Image Extension (XIE)

 XIE includes a Client and Server component. The Client allows access
 to XIE-compliant X Servers including X terminals such as the VXT2000.
 The Server provides X Server-based image rendition support for VAXs-
 tations.

 o  Session Services-allows clients to initialize and terminate a ses-
    sion with an X Image Server Extension.

 o  Resource Services-allows clients to create, query, copy, and delete
    one of the following X Image Extensions Server resources:

       Photomap-image objects that contain the image data and closely
       associated attributes

                                  4

 

       IDC-image domain context to define the subset or region of an
       image or process and act as an area operand in area image op-
       erations

       Photoflo-image process context that describes the relationship
       between the various transfer, enhancement, and rendition pro-
       cesses

 o  Server/Client image/export services-allows clients to read and write
    image data within the X Image Server Extension resource from and
    to core DECwindows X Server drawables.

 o  Transport services-allows the transfer of image data to and from
    the client and X Image Server Extension in compressed or uncompressed
    form.

 o  Process services-provides for the application of low level image
    operators and image data, primarily in support of preparation for
    or improvement of a display.

 o  Statistic services-provides clients with the procedures to gener-
    ate statistical information such as the mean, variance, standard
    deviation, maximum, and minimum about the data within an image.

 o  Process control services-provides clients with the ability to de-
    fine and apply pipelines containing transport, process, and dis-
    play operations.

 o  Event services-allows clients to select or query X Image Server Ex-
    tension specific events.

 DCL IMAGE is a command line interface to specific functions.

 o  IMAGE RENDER converts a DDIF bitonal or continuous-tone image file
    into a format suitable for output, display, or printing on a spe-
    cific device. It adjusts the image file to match the type, char-
    acteristics, and presentation level protocol of the output device.

 o  IMAGE VIEW permits the user to see a final form bitonal or contin-
    uous tone image file on a display device that supports sixel, DDIF,
    or X Window System format.

                                  5

 

 o  IMAGE ADJUST allows the user to create a new revisable form image
    file from an existing revisable form image file (bitonal or con-
    tinuous tone), allowing three adjustments: crop or extract a piece
    of the original image; scale (enlarge or reduce) the original im-
    age; and rotate or reorient the original image.
