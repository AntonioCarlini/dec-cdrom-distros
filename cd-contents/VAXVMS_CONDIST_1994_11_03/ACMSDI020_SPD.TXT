 Development Environment

 ACMS Desktop provides a set of application programming interfaces, along
 with support libraries, that allow software programs to interact with
 ACMS and ACMSxp applications as authenticated clients. These inter-
 faces allow programmers to write client programs without requiring ex-
 tensive programming knowledge of network communications or the ACMS
 or ACMSxp languages.

 ACMS Desktop Clients

 ACMS Desktop provides application programming interfaces for the Mi-
 crosoft Windows, DOS, Windows NT, Macintosh, OpenVMS, OSF/1, and SCO
 UNIX environments. These client services allow the desktop program-
 mer to develop programs that:

 o  Sign in to the ACMS Desktop server for client authentication

 o  Select ACMS tasks for execution under the control of the ACMS Ex-
    ecution Controller or through the ACMSxp task server

 o  Respond to callbacks from the ACMS or ACMSxp system as part of ACMS
    task exchange steps (forms processing)

 o  Sign out of the ACMS Desktop server

 Supports Use of Native Windowing and Forms Packages

 Appropriate customer-provided display software can be used on each desk-
 top. For instance, on the Macintosh operating system, HyperCard® may
 be used; on DOS, Microsoft Windows may be used. Any such packages must
 include facilities to call object libraries that provide the ACMS Desk-
 top client services.

 Nonblocking Execution

 ACMS Desktop clients support nonblocking programs. For event-driven
 processing environments such as Windows, programs may be structured
 to include an event-dispatching mechanism and a collection of proce-
 dures that are invoked by this dispatching mechanism as a result of
 an event. Ideally, these procedures are written to complete quickly
 so that other events can be dispatched without delay.

                                  3

 

 ACMS Desktop client services allow an application to release control
 to the event-dispatching mechanism without waiting for a response from
 the ACMS Desktop server. This is important where network traffic is
 delayed and/or a large amount of processing is performed by the ACMS
 or ACMSxp application system. ACMS Desktop Portable Client

 The portable client interface provides support for two models of ap-
 plication development:

 o  Blocking interface where execution of the program is blocked dur-
    ing execution of the ACMS Desktop servers, for example, Microsoft
    COBOL on DOS.

 o  Nonblocking event-driven interface to accommodate such nonblock-
    ing tools as Motif® or Microsoft Windows.

 The services provided by the ACMS Desktop portable client for Microsoft
 Windows, Windows NT, DOS, OSF/1, SCO UNIX, and OpenVMS are:

 o  acmsdi_call_task - executes an ACMS or ACMSxp task, passing task
    arguments specified for read, write, or modify access

 o  acmsdi_cancel - cancels a currently executing task (nonblocking only,
    and not available with ACMSxp)

 o  acmsdi_complete_pp - completes an outstanding exchange step (non-
    blocking only)

 o  acmsdi_dispatch_message - checks for ACMS Desktop Server messages
    (nonblocking only)

 o  acmsdi_return_pointer - used by client programs written in Visual
    Basic® to create pointers to data

 o  acmsdi_sign_in - signs a user in to ACMS Desktop and establishes
    a session

 o  acmsdi_sign_out - signs a user out of ACMS Desktop and terminates
    a session

                                  4

 

 Presentation procedure routines are called automatically by the ACMS
 Desktop portable client to facilitate forms processing for the desk-
 top user. These routines, which support blocking or nonblocking ex-
 ecution, are as follows:

 o  acmsdi_disable - shuts down forms sessions on the desktop in re-
    sponse to an acmsdi_sign_out service call

 o  acmsdi_enable - initializes data structures that are used by a num-
    ber of presentation procedures (invoked when a user calls an ACMS
    or ACMSxp task that includes a form name that has not been previ-
    ously referenced)

 o  acmsdi_receive - executes forms operations in response to a RECEIVE
    in a called ACMS or ACMSxp task

 o  acmsdi_request - executes forms operations in response to a REQUEST
    in a called ACMS task (Note: TDMS is not available with ACMSxp)

 o  acmsdi_send - executes forms operations in response to a SEND in
    a called ACMS or ACMSxp task

 o  acmsdi_transceive - executes forms operations in response to a TRANSCEIVE
    in a called ACMS or ACMSxp task

 DOS Memory Models and Modes

 Small-, medium-, and large-memory models are supported for Microsoft
 Windows and DOS.

 For applications using Microsoft Windows, Enhanced Windows Operating
 Mode is supported.

 ACMS Desktop Client for Macintosh

 This application programming interface supports the Data Access Man-
 ager (DAM) facility of the Macintosh operating system. A special DAM
 device driver (DDEV) provides the following services for client ex-
 ecution:

 o  DBBreak - cancels a currently executing ACMS task

 o  DBEnd - signs a user out of ACMS

                                  5

 

 o  DBExec - executes an ACMS task

 o  DBGetConnInfo - returns information about the current state of a
    given session

 o  DBGetErr - retrieves detailed error information

 o  DBGetItem - retrieves task completion status, returned workspaces,
    and exchange step data

 o  DBGetSessNum - returns the session number for a given session iden-
    tifier

 o  DBInit - signs a user in to ACMS

 o  DBSend - prepares elements of a message for transmission to the ACMS
    system

 o  DBSendItem - prepares elements of a message, including task argu-
    ments specified for read, write, or modify access, for transmis-
    sion to the ACMS system

 o  DBState - checks for task execution completion

 o  InitDBPack - loads the Data Access Manager

 These services are synchronous; program control returns only when ser-
 vice execution is complete. Nonblocking task execution is supported
 because the DBExec service completes as soon as the task is submit-
 ted for execution to ACMS. The DBState service is used to poll for task
 completion.

 Asynchronous parameter block cannot be used with these services.

 Run-Time System

 Desktop Client Run-Time Libraries



                                  6

 

 Run-time libraries are provided for the client operating systems to
 support the execution of client programs that use the ACMS Desktop ser-
 vices. The ACMS Desktop client for Microsoft Windows includes dynamic-
 link libraries. (For DECnet, Microsoft Windows clients static-link li-
 braries are also provided.) The ACMS Desktop client for Macintosh in-
 cludes external functions for HyperCard and 4th Dimension® applica-
 tions.

 ACMS Desktop Server

 The ACMS Desktop server is an asynchronous, multithreaded, run-time
 component residing on any OpenVMS or OSF/1 node, regardless of the lo-
 cation of ACMS or ACMSxp applications being called by desktop clients.
 There is generally one ACMS Desktop server on a node. Additional ACMS
 Desktop servers can be executed to debug tasks. The ACMS Desktop server
 is an ACMS agent or gateway into ACMS or ACMSxp that performs the fol-
 lowing functions:

 o  Authenticates desktop clients (ACMS/ACMSxp submitters)

 o  Calls tasks for users; this can include local and remote ACMS task
    selection

 o  Communicates with the desktop client program as part of task ex-
    change step (desktop presentation procedure) execution

 o  Provides information to the system manager concerning ACMS Desk-
    top submitters (ACMS only)

 Network Support

 The following network connectivity software is supported (see Soft-
 ware Requirements) for desktop nodes connected to a Local Area Net-
 work (LAN) or a Wide Area Network (WAN):

 o  AppleTalk

 o  DECnet

 o  Dial-in (serial communication)

 o  NetWare SPX/IPX

                                  7

 

 o  TCP/IP

 o  X.25

 Note: For OpenVMS clients, communication modules are provided for test
 purposes for TCP/IP and Novell® NetWare but are UNSUPPORTED. For OSF/1
 servers, TCP/IP is the only supported network protocol.

 Management and Control

 Support Features

 The following features are provided as part of the ACMS Desktop sys-
 tem:

 o  The ACMS Desktop client services report errors from ACMS or ACM-
    Sxp back to the desktop client program for local error handling.

 o  The ACMS Desktop client optionally services log error messages to
    a local desktop device file (available on Microsoft Windows, Win-
    dows NT, DOS, SCO UNIX, OSF/1, and OpenVMS).

 o  Messages can be protected against sabotage or network corruption
    by adding Cyclic Redundancy Checking (CRC).

 o  The ACMS Desktop server reports ACMS and desktop client errors to
    the ACMS software event logger. The ACMS Desktop server for ACM-
    Sxp outputs error reports to a server-specific log file.

 o  OpenVMS system managers can control desktop client access to ACMS
    and remove desktop clients from the ACMS system, using standard ACMS
    utilities.

 o  ACMS Desktop for OpenVMS provides support, through DECtrace, for
    the display of server event information.

 Programming Services



                                  8

 

 The following ACMS Desktop for OpenVMS services are provided on the
 server system to assist in system management activities:

 o  acmsdi$get_submitter_info - returns information regarding active
    ACMS Desktop server clients (available on OpenVMS).

    A sample program that uses this service to display all current ACMS
    Desktop submitters is provided. This sample program is an UNSUP-
    PORTED software component.

 o  acmsdi_check_version - optional customer-supplied routine that is
    called by the ACMS Desktop clients to check a version string from
    the ACMS Desktop server against the client program version (avail-
    able on Microsoft Windows, Windows NT, DOS, OSF/1, SCO UNIX, and
    OpenVMS).

 o  acmsdi_get_version - optional customer-supplied routine that is called
    by the ACMS Desktop server to return a version string to the desk-
    top program clients (available on OpenVMS).
