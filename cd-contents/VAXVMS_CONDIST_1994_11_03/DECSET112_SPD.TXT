 Language-Sensitive Editor

 The Language-Sensitive Editor (LSE)  is a multi-language programmer's
 editor.  Language-specific templates and on-line language help assist
 both new and experienced programmers in  developing  programs faster.
 With  LSE,  users  can efficiently edit, compile,  review  diagnostic
 information  from  compilations,  and  correct  compile  time  errors
 without exiting the editor.  LSE also enables users  to customize and
 extend their editing environment.

 Programmers  can  do  low-level program designs with LSE by embedding
 pseudocode  in  source  code.    Users  can also view source code  at
 various levels of detail by replacing a sequence of source lines with
 a single overview line.

 The  following  VAX  compilers  fully  support  LSE;    the  language
 templates are included with LSE:

 o  DEC Ada

 o  VAX BASIC

 o  VAX BLISS-32 Implementation Language

 o  VAX C

 o  VAX COBOL for OpenVMS VAX

 o  DEC Fortran

 o  VAX MACRO

 o  DEC Pascal for OpenVMS VAX

 o  VAX PL/I

 The  following  VAX  compilers  fully  support  LSE;    the  language
 templates are included with the VAX compiler:

 o  CDD/Repository for OpenVMS VAX Systems
    (formerly known as VAX CDD/Plus)

 o  VAX DIBOL

                                  2

 

 o  VAX DOCUMENT

 o  DEC Rdb for OpenVMS VAX

 o  VAX SCAN

 o  VAXELN Pascal

 The following VAX products partially support  LSE  (refer  to product
 SPDs for more details);  the templates are included with the product.

 o  VAX ACMS

 o  VAX DATATRIEVE

 o  DECwindows UIL

 Note:  Certain LSE features are not  available  when  using  language
 preprocessors, such as those supplied for DEC Rdb for OpenVMS VAX and
 VAX  DBMS.  Consult your local Digital representative for  additional
 information.

 LSE works in concert with the DEC Code Management System  for OpenVMS
 VAX  Systems (CMS), the Source Code Analyzer (SCA) component, and the
 VAX  symbolic  debugger  to  provide  a  highly  interactive  on-line
 environment that facilitates the  NAVIGATE-EDIT-COMPILE-DEBUG portion
 of the program development cycle.   DECset users can directly reserve
 and replace files from the Code Management System while in LSE, go to
 the exact source code location in LSE  from the Source Code Analyzer,
 and go to the exact source code location in LSE from the VAX symbolic
 debugger.

 Source Code Analyzer

 The Source Code Analyzer (SCA) aids programmers in understanding  the
 complexities  of software systems.  Since it allows users to  analyze
 an  entire  system, as opposed to individual modules, and helps users
 understand unfamiliar systems,  SCA  is  extremely useful during both
 the implementation and maintenance phases of a project.


                                  3

 

 SCA provides navigation capabilities  to assist users in locating and
 viewing components of their source  code.    SCA accomplishes this by
 storing compiler-generated information about a set of source files in
 an SCA library.  SCA then allows users to perform queries about their
 source code in the following ways:

 o  Using a name browser to locate all items that match a search string

 o  Specifying a cross-reference query to find how and  where  program
    symbols are used

 o  Specifying   a  call  graph  query  to  graphically  display  call
    relationships between routines

 o  Specifying  a  data  structure  query  to  graphically display the
    structure of data types in the source code or to find symbols of a
    given type

 After users have a  query  result,  they  can  use  the  go-to-source
 feature to navigate to locations of interest in their source code.

 SCA also provides static analysis  capabilities  to  assist  users in
 checking for consistent use of program symbols.

 The following VAX compilers generate information  to  populate an SCA
 library:

 o  DEC Ada*

 o  VAX BASIC

 o  VAX BLISS-32 Implementation Language

 o  VAX C

 o  DEC COBOL for OpenVMS VAX Systems

 o  DEC Fortran

 o  VAX MACRO (cross-referencing only)

 o  DEC Pascal for OpenVMS VAX

 o  VAX PL/I

                                  4

 

 o  VAX SCAN

 o  VAXELN Pascal

 *  Some  versions  of DEC Ada supply an  SCA  library  that  must  be
    converted to SCA V4.0 format.

 Note:  SCA is not available when using language preprocessors such as
 those  supplied for DEC Rdb for OpenVMS VAX and  VAX  DBMS.    Please
 consult your local Digital representative for additional information.

 The  following VAX compilers also generate pseudocode and specialized
 comment processing  information  so  SCA  can produce design reports,
 cross-reference and analysis information:

 o  DEC Ada

 o  VAX BASIC

 o  VAX BLISS-32 Implementation Language

 o  VAX C

 o  DEC COBOL for OpenVMS VAX Systems

 o  DEC FORTRAN

 o  DEC Pascal for OpenVMS VAX

 o  VAX PL/I

 DEC Language-Sensitive Editor/Source  Code  Analyzer  for OpenVMS VAX
 Systems is a component  of the DECset for OpenVMS VAX Systems product
 and is also available separately.    Please  refer  to  the  ORDERING
 INFORMATION section of this SPD.

 DEC Test Manager for OpenVMS VAX Systems

 The DEC Test Manager for OpenVMS  VAX Systems is a regression testing
 tool  which  automates  the  creation and maintenance  of  regression
 tests.

                                  5

 

 It  also automatically compares test run results with  expected  test
 results.    The DEC Test Manager provides users with  flexibility  in
 organizing  tests,  selecting  tests for execution, and verifying and
 reviewing test results.  With the DEC Test Manager, users can:

 o  Test batch, command line, and X Window System[TM] applications

 o  Test interactive  applications  which  input  and  output  text to
    character cell terminals  (DEC  and  ANSI CRT) with single display
    plane

 o  Create software tests

 o  Group tests into meaningful combinations

 o  Execute specific tests, groups of tests, or combinations of groups
    of tests

 o  Compare the results of  the  executed  tests  with  benchmark test
    results to determine differences

 o  View test results interactively

 o  Update benchmarks as needed

 o  Filter test results to ignore output which is expected to change
    for each run

 o  Mask certain screen areas when  comparing  executed  test  results
    from X Window applications against benchmark test results

 The DEC Test Manager for OpenVMS  VAX  Systems enables users to store
 software test descriptions and related files in  DEC  Code Management
 System   for  OpenVMS  VAX  Systems  (CMS)  libraries  for    storage
 efficiency.

 When used with CMS, all users of DEC Test  Manager  must  be licensed
 for CMS use.

 DEC Test Manager for OpenVMS VAX Systems is a component of the DECset
 for  OpenVMS  VAX  Systems  product and is also available separately.

 DEC Performance and Coverage Analyzer for OpenVMS VAX Systems

 The DEC  Performance  and  Coverage  Analyzer for OpenVMS VAX Systems
 (PCA)  helps users  pinpoint  execution  bottlenecks  in  application
 programs.  PCA can  also  identify  which parts of an application are
 not executed by a given set of test data.

 PCA has two components:   the Collector, which gathers performance or
 test coverage data on the running  user  program;   and the Analyzer,
 which later processes and displays the collected  data.  The Analyzer
 graphically    presents    information  in  three  types  of  charts:
 histograms, tables, and annotated source listings.

 PCA can gather and report on the following types of performance data:

 o  Ada multi-tasking data

 o  PC sampling data

 o  CPU sampling data

 o  Execution counts

 o  Test coverage

 o  Event markers

 o  Page fault data

 o  System service counts

 o  Input/Output statistics

 o  Vector PC sampling data

 o  Vector CPU sampling data

 o  Vector Execution counts

 Note:  PCA does not analyze operating system performance  or  aid  in
 hardware  resource  planning.    Certain  features  of  PCA  are  not
 available when  using  language  preprocessors such as those supplied
 for DEC Rdb  for OpenVMS VAX and VAX DBMS.  Please consult your local
 Digital representative for additional information.

 With PCA, users can  analyze  applications  written  in  any  of  the
 following OpenVMS languages:

                                  7

 

 o  DEC Ada

 o  VAX BASIC

 o  VAX BLISS-32 Implementation Language

 o  VAX C

 o  DEC COBOL for OpenVMS VAX Systems

 o  VAX DIBOL

 o  DEC Fortran (includes vector processing features)

 o  DEC Pascal for OpenVMS VAX

 o  VAX PL/I

 o  VAX SCAN

 Note: Not all PCA features are available to each of these languages.

 PCA works in concert with  LSE  and  the  DEC Test Manager.  From the
 character cell version of PCA, users can communicate with LSE and can
 examine source code.  When used with  the  DEC  Test Manager, PCA can
 evaluate the code coverage of a user's test system.

 DEC Performance and Coverage Analyzer for OpenVMS VAX  Systems  is  a
 component of the DECset for OpenVMS VAX Systems product  and  is also
 available separately.    Please  refer  to  the  ORDERING INFORMATION
 section of this SPD.

 DEC Code Management System for OpenVMS VAX Systems

 The DEC Code Management System for OpenVMS VAX Systems (CMS) provides
 an  efficient method for  storing  project  files  and  tracking  all
 changes to those files.   Code  management is especially important to
 projects  that  have  long  lifespans  or  several  versions  of  the
 software.

 CMS   stores  any  kind  of  file,  including    documents,    plans,
 specifications,  status  reports,  source  code  files, object files,
 executable images,  sixel  files,  or other records.  CMS keeps these
 files in project libraries.  CMS also stores history information.  As
 a project evolves, CMS  tracks changes to the library by storing only
 the changes made to a file.  Not only does this reduce the amount of 



                                  8

 

 disk space used for storing multiple versions of files, but it allows
 CMS to reconstruct any previous version of a file and to identify the
 changes made  between  any  two  versions.    In  addition to storing
 successive changes, CMS  maintains  a  record  of  who  is  currently
 working on a library  element  and  a  historical  record  of library
 access.

 With CMS, users can:

 o  Support multiple project libraries

 o  Retrieve previous file generations (same version)

 o  Delete, purge, or collapse generations

 o  Obtain a report of file modifications, including when, why, and by
    whom the modification was made

 o  Determine  the  origin  of each line  of  a  file,  either  as  an
    annotated listing or as comments in the file

 o  Manage concurrent modifications

 o  Merge separately developed modifications

 o  Combine related files together as a "group"

 o  Relate  the  generation  of  one  element  to   the  corresponding
    generations  of other elements for purposes of freezing  baselines
    or releases and for organizing ongoing development

 o  Interface via callable routines as well as through the CMS command
    line interface and the VMS DECwindows Motif interface

 o  Through  the  use  of CMS access control lists, fine tune  OpenVMS
    security  mechanisms  applied to CMS libraries and provide a means
    of notification about library events

 CMS  can  act  as a project's  central  repository,  by  storing  and
 tracking source code files, object code, documentation, and a variety
 of files generated by other OpenVMS tools.   CMS  can store files for
 the Module Management System (MMS) and the DEC Test Manager.  LSE and


                                  9

 

 DEC  Test Manager users can access CMS elements directly from  within
 LSE and DEC Test Manager.

 DEC Code Management System for OpenVMS VAX Systems is a component  of
 the  DECset  for  OpenVMS  VAX  Systems product and is also available
 separately.  Please refer to the ORDERING INFORMATION section of this
 SPD.

 DEC Module Management System for OpenVMS VAX Systems

 The DEC Module  Management  System  for  OpenVMS  VAX  Systems  (MMS)
 automates  and  simplifies the  building  of  software  applications,
 whether they are simple programs  of only one or two files or complex
 programs  consisting  of  many  source  files,   message  files,  and
 documentation.  MMS can optimize the build process by rebuilding only
 those components of a system that have changed  since  the system was
 last built.  In this way, MMS eliminates the steps of recompiling and
 linking  modules  that  have  not  changed.    Once  users  create  a
 description file containing  the  rules  describing the relationships
 among the components of  their  application  and  the MMS commands to
 build the application, MMS can  build  both  small  and large systems
 with one command.

 Note:  The ACS library manager  subsystem  in DEC Ada duplicates many
 of the MMS features.

 MMS can interact with CMS, access definitions  in CDD/Repository, and
 access forms stored in libraries for DECforms.

 DEC Module Management Systems for OpenVMS VAX Systems  is a component
 of the DECset for OpenVMS VAX Systems product and  is  also available
 separately.  Please refer to the ORDERING INFORMATION section of this
 SPD.
