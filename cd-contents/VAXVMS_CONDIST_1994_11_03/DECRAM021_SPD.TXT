PRODUCT NAME:  DECram Version 2.1 for OpenVMS[*]       SPD 34.26.03

DESCRIPTION

DECram Version 2.1 for OpenVMS supports both the OpenVMS AXP and 
OpenVMS VAX platforms.

DECram for OpenVMS is a disk device driver that allows an OpenVMS 
system manager to create pseudo disks (RAMdisks) that reside in main 
memory for the purpose of improving I/O performance. Frequently ac-
cessed data can be accessed much faster from a DECram device than 
from a physical disk device. These RAMdisks can be accessed through 
the file system just as physical disks are accessed, requiring no 
change to application or system software.

The number of DECram units used is quite small (usually one, but 
sometimes two or more).

Because main memory is allocated for the DECram device, a substantial 
amount of extra memory is generally required. The amount of memory 
dedicated is selectable. The OpenVMS system manager designates the 
amount of memory dedicated to the DECram device(s) and the files that 
will be stored on it. The maximum size of a DECram device is 524,280 
blocks.

Cluster Environment

DECram Version 2.1 for OpenVMS is fully supported when installed 
on any valid and licensed VAX or AXP system and in a VAXcluster, 
VMScluster or Mixed Architecture Cluster (MAC) configuration without 
restrictions. DECram devices can be MSCP served and members of a 
shadow set. There are no special hardware requirements.

 The  terms OpenVMS and VMS refer to the OpenVMS Operating System.

User Interface

The user interface to a DECram device is the same as other disk class
devices. Note that the response to a SHOW DEVICE /FULL command will
indicate "device type unknown" in current OpenVMS releases. The device 
type DT$_RAM_DISK is not known by the SHOW DEVICE command in current 
OpenVMS releases.

Management Interface

A DECram device is managed using the same tools used to manage any other
OpenVMS supported disk, that is, SYSGEN, INITIALIZE, MOUNT, and so on.
However, the standard utilities are used differently to set up a DECram 
device.

System Analysis

Before creating a DECram device, the OpenVMS system manager must de-
termine its size. Each disk block allocated to a DECram device will
mean one less page of memory available. The system manager should 
also assess the need for multiple DECram units.

System Generation

The OpenVMS system manager must reassess the values for the SYSGEN 
parameters that control paging and swapping behavior.

Restrictions

DECram Version 2.1 for OpenVMS currently has the following restric-
tions:

o  Data in a DECram device is volatile

o  DECram device cannot exceed 524,280 blocks

DECram for OpenVMS will not support long-term data storage because data
in a DECram device is volatile. If a system or hardware failure occurs, 
data stored in the DECram device is lost and must be recreated.
