          PRODUCT NAME:  DECimage EXpress, Version 2.2A          SPD 37.41.03

          DESCRIPTION

          DECimage EXpress is a document image management system. It includes
          a ready-to-use application and an application development environment
          which can be used as a platform for layered custom applications and
          systems integration. DECimage EXpress works in conjunction with other
          hardware and software products such as scanners, printers, optical stor-
          age, and FAX equipment. DECimage EXpress includes a server and one or
          more clients. The number of clients supported on a specific server de-
          pends on the hardware configuration and the amount of images and in-
          dex data required. The server runs on any supported VAX processor. The
          clients can be a combination of supported PCs, workstations, and X Ter-
          minals. Using this combination, DECimage EXpress delivers the abil-
          ity to convert a paper-based information system to an online, image-
          based information system. Among the capabilities of DECimage EXpress
          are image acquisition, document index, view, storage, query, distri-
          bution (electronic mail, FAX, print), and system management.

          In addition, DECimage EXpress Application Development Environment (DADE)
          is the VAX C callable application programming interface (API) that is
          used to extend the DECimage EXpress system. This API provides appli-
          cations with access to a set of routines used by DECimage EXpress Sys-
          tem Administration, Data Storage, and Document Indexing subsystems to
          access documents within DECimage EXpress. This enables the DECimage
          EXpress user to use ready-made applications that layer on DECimage EX-
          press or to develop a custom application for specific requirements.

          DECimage EXpress, Version 2.2A                        SPD 37.41.03


          For PC users, the DECimage EXpress PC Client includes the Document Ma-
          nipulator Facility. The Document Manupulator Facility provides an API
          that gives access to the DECimage EXpress PC-based scanning and doc-
          ument viewing utilities. Sample Visual Basic programs that demonstrate
          customization of the user interface layout are also included.

             -  Assigns functional privileges of user accounts for print, in-
                dex, delete, autoindex, modify, scan, FAX, system management,
                move, copy, and append

          o  Provides a utility to control the migration of documents from mag-
             netic to optical storage, remove documents from the database, and
             manage the configuration of the storage server.

          System Performance

          Performance is dependent upon the particular hardware and software con-
          figuration being used, the number of active users on the system, the
          type of functions being simultaneously performed (i.e., scanning, in-
          dexing, migration, viewing), and the images (type, density, etc.) be-
          ing processed.

          The system configuration must include sufficient cpu capacity, mem-
          ory, disk drives, and network capacity to support the system workload
          requirements for image acquisition, indexing, storage, and database
          access. Consult Digital for system configurations guidelines.

          STANDARDS SUPPORTED
