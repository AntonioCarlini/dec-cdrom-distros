PRODUCT NAME:  DEC DATATRIEVE Version 7.1 for OpenVMS VAX Systems SPD
24.44.30

DESCRIPTION

DEC[TM] DATATRIEVE[TM] for OpenVMS[TM] VAX[TM] systems is a query, re-
port, and data management tool for the OpenVMS Operating System. It
provides a uniform access method for data stored by RMS[TM], Oracle Rdb[TM],
and Oracle CODASYL DBMS[TM] files on OpenVMS and data residing in other
databases accessible by the DEC DB Integrator Gateway products. Us-
ing DEC DATATRIEVE, a novice or experienced user can retrieve or mod-
ify data without considering the underlying storage method or phys-
ical location.

Modes of Operation

DEC DATATRIEVE presents information in several different formats. In-
formation can be displayed using simple defaults or can be reported
on through a more flexible report writer. Information can be displayed
on a terminal or workstation, printed on a hard-copy device, or writ-
ten to a file. Information can also be presented graphically with user-
defined VAX FMS[TM] and VAX TDMS forms, as well as with DECforms[TM].
Graphics output is ReGIS[TM]; it can be managed by devices or convert-
ers accepting ReGIS. DEC DATATRIEVE also provides an efficient way to
access information stored on other VAX, Alpha or PDP[TM]-11 systems
linked by DECnet[TM].

DEC DATATRIEVE can be used interactively to retrieve, modify, store,
or delete data using a simple set of commands. Frequently used com-
binations of commands can be stored as named procedures and invoked

by name. Programs written in other DEC languages can call DEC DATA-
TRIEVE, allowing them to be independent of underlying data storage meth-
ods and physical location.

A DECwindows[TM] Motif[R] interface to DEC DATATRIEVE is provided. This
allows the user to perform a subset of the DEC DATATRIEVE functions
using menu bars, scroll bars, pop-up menus, pull-down menus, and but-
tons. The user can also use a navigator to browse through the dictio-
nary directories, select objects, and execute commands on them directly
from pop-up menus.

Data Dictionary

DEC DATATRIEVE is dictionary driven. DEC DATATRIEVE Version 7.1 has
removed the dependencies from Oracle CDD/Repository by supporting a
new textfile dictionary in addition to Oracle CDD/Repository. DEC DATA-
TRIEVE Version 7.1 provides the following two independent dictionary
alternatives:

o  Data Dictionary using Oracle CDD/Repository for OpenVMS.

o  DEC DATATRIEVE Textfile-based dictionary.

Data Dictionary using Oracle CDD/Repository for OpenVMS

Using this dictionary, data descriptions are stored in and retrieved
from Oracle CDD/Repository for OpenVMS. DEC DATATRIEVE includes com-
mands to store, examine, modify, and delete definitions in the dic-
tionary and can use definitions stored by other layered products, such
as the Oracle CODASYL DBMS schema definitions or the Oracle Rdb for
OpenVMS database definitions. DATATRIEVE requires the Oracle/CDD Repos-
itory in order to manage the Oracle CODASYL DBMS databases.

DEC DATATRIEVE fully supports CDO format dictionaries, including the
ability to access shareable fields. Pieces tracking is also supported
for these entities. DEC DATATRIEVE includes full support for DMU for-
mat dictionaries as well.

Textfile-based Dictionary

                                 2

 

If Oracle CDD/Repository is present on the system, you can select, at
installation time, whether to link DEC DATATRIEVE with Oracle CDD/Repository
or not. When Oracle CDD/Repository is linked to DEC DATATRIEVE, its
use can dynamically be disabled and enabled at run-time by using the
SET CDD and SET NO CDD commands. When Oracle CDD/Repository is not linked
to DEC DATATRIEVE, the alternative textfile dictionary is enabled.

The new textfile dictionary stores the DEC DATATRIEVE object defini-
tions as text in text files.

Oracle CDD/Repository object definitions can be extracted and rede-
fined as files in the new dictionary system. Text file definitions can-
not be shared with compilers and database systems, but can be accessed
and manipulated by applications and OpenVMS utilities.

Temporary Definition of Objects

DEC DATATRIEVE Version 7.1 extends the use the DECLARE command to de-
fine DEC DATATRIEVE objects. Such objects are temporary (time scope
is within a DEC DATATRIEVE session) and do not depend on any dictio-
nary system, as they are stored in memory.

Protection

-  Protection with Oracle CDD/Repository

When DEC DATATRIEVE accesses data through data definitions stored by
Oracle CDD/Repository for OpenVMS, protection provided by Oracle CDD/Repository
applies. An Access Control List associated with an object definition
specifies which types of access are granted to the definition itself,
and to the defined data. Standard OpenVMS Access Elements can be used
based on usernames, UICs, and identifiers. Access rights for termi-
nals can be specified also.

-  Protection with the DATATRIEVE resident dictionary using text files

Text file definitions are subject to the OpenVMS ACL protections, and
must be defined and managed by the programmer, using the appropriate
DATATRIEVE or OpenVMS commands.

-  Protection with in-memory temporary object definitions

                                 3

 

In-memory temporary object definitions do not use any protection mech-
anisms, and bypass those definitions defined by either Oracle CDD/Repository
or the textfile dictionary.

Remote Data Access

DEC DATATRIEVE provides access to data on remote systems in two ways
as follows:

o  Takes advantage of the remote data access functionality transpar-
   ently provided by the individual data base management systems (for
   example, RMS remote files, Oracle Rdb remote databases) according
   to their rules.

o  Requests a DATATRIEVE server to start on the remote system (Open-
   VMS Alpha and VAX systems or PDP-11) to manage the data definitions
   and process data remotely. Most operations are performed on the server
   node and only selected data is exchanged between the requester and
   the server systems. To work in this way, a DATATRIEVE system (DEC
   DATATRIEVE or DATATRIEVE-11) must be installed on the server node.

For the Nonprogrammer

DEC DATATRIEVE provides the novice user with a tutorial mode called
GUIDE Mode.

DEC DATATRIEVE offers ADT (Application Design Tool) for the more ex-
perienced user who wants to define data structures. ADT takes the user
step-by-step through the definition of a domain based on an RMS data
file.

If DEC DATATRIEVE is used on the same information by experienced and
novice users, the novice user can use the full power of the language
by invoking procedures designed by the more experienced user.

For the Programmer

DEC DATATRIEVE is a highly structured language that provides automatic
access optimization, data type conversion, and data validation. Loop-
ing and control structures, such as IF THEN ELSE, BEGIN END, REPEAT,

                                 4

 

WHILE, CHOICE and FOR (each record) can be combined and nested to cre-
ate complex, powerful procedures.

DEC DATATRIEVE responds to programming errors with clear, explicit er-
ror messages. The user can issue an EDIT command to invoke a text ed-
itor with an erroneous statement as input text, correct the mistake,
and resubmit the command. This editor can be either EDT, TPU, or DEC
Language-Sensitive Editor (LSE) and is controlled by a user logical
name assignment.

Data Definition

DEC DATATRIEVE stores the fixed attributes of each record in the record
definition. In addition to COBOL-like attributes, DEC DATATRIEVE al-
lows validation criteria, fields whose values are computed at run-time,
missing value expressions, and default values.

DEC DATATRIEVE supports most data types used by DEC Fortran[TM], COBOL,
VAX PL/I, DEC C, and DEC BASIC[TM]. DEC DATATRIEVE also supports Vary-
ing String and Segmented String data types in DEC Oracle Rdb for Open-
VMS databases.

Views

A VIEW is an alternative description of data. It can be used to al-
low a user access to a subset of the data items in a record. It can
restrict a user by including only some of the data items in a record,
or it can combine data items from several files. Information can be
linked through common values (or set linkages in Oracle CODASYL DBMS)
to produce complex hierarchical structures. Using a predefined VIEW,
a user can access and display data from several files at once with the
same commands used on a single file. Data accessed through a VIEW can
be printed and modified, but data cannot be stored or erased using a
VIEW.

Call Interface

DEC DATATRIEVE provides a client/server API. The DATATRIEVE Client li-
braries for OpenVMS and Windows[TM] systems are supplied with the kit
of the DATATRIEVE product for OpenVMS systems, and can be copied freely
to Client systems.

DEC DATATRIEVE can be accessed from the following programs:

o  Programs linked with DEC DATATRIEVE, residing on the same node and
   process space where DEC DATATRIEVE resides, and written in high-
   level languages such as DEC Fortran, DEC C, COBOL, DEC BASIC, DEC
   Pascal[TM], and VAX PL/I.

o  Programs linked with a DEC DATATRIEVE client library, residing on
   different nodes or platforms, and written in Visual C++[R], Visual Basic[R]
   or OpenVMS program languages.

DEC DATATRIEVE automatically converts data from its storage format to
the format expected by the program.

DEC DATATRIEVE Client for Windows[TM]

The DEC DATATRIEVE Client/Server architecture allows existing DEC DATA-
TRIEVE users to downsize and distribute their applications and inter-
active DEC DATATRIEVE operations.

The DEC DATATRIEVE Client for Windows is separately packaged.

                                 6

 

DEC DATATRIEVE Client for Windows is an application which provides a
user-friendly graphical interface on personal computers running Mi-
crosoft[R] Windows to perform DEC DATATRIEVE operations on a connected
server.

The DEC DATATRIEVE Client for Windows offers a graphical user inter-
face that permits users to:

o  Browse through the dictionary from a Windows desktop.

o  Access, modify, and execute their existing DEC DATATRIEVE proce-
   dures and dictionary objects.

o  Access the DEC DATATRIEVE language for interactive queries using
   a query editor.

o  Operate on data: display, modify, and store.

o  Interoperate (data import/export) with other PC applications.

DEC DATATRIEVE Client for Windows Version 1.1 contains the following
new features, that permit users to:

o  Use a query-by-example mechanism in the Query Editor. A query can
   be specified by providing constraints on field values and simple
   links between fields, without using the graphical query editor.

o  Define DEC DATATRIEVE objects using specific dialog boxes that guide
   the creation of the objects themselves.

o  Use plots. DEC DATATRIEVE Client for Windows PLOT statements pro-
   duce graphic results in the client environment.

o  Use Client/Server TCP/IP transport in addition to DECnet.

Storage Methods

DEC DATATRIEVE uses a single, consistent syntax to provide full ac-
cess to information stored in RMS for OpenVMS sequential or indexed
files (RMS relative files are supported for queries only), Oracle CO-
DASYL DBMS, and Oracle Rdb databases. DEC DATATRIEVE can also provide
access to information stored in certain IBM[R] mainframe databases through

                                 7

 

the use of DEC DB Integrator Gateway for DB2[TM], as well as infor-
mation stored in ORACLE[R] databases through DEC DB Integrator Gate-
way for ORACLE, and SYBASE[R] databases through DEC DB Integrator Gate-
way for SYBASE. Data from all these sources can be combined into a sin-
gle VIEW.

If access to a Oracle CODASYL DBMS database involves explicit set walk-
ing or if records must be manually connected or disconnected from sets,
the user can employ DEC DATATRIEVE language features that are specific
to Oracle CODASYL DBMS access. However, if the user employs VIEWS or
implicit set walking, DEC DATATRIEVE can access information in Ora-
cle CODASYL DBMS databases using the same syntax used for data from
an RMS file or Oracle Rdb.

Report Generation

The DEC DATATRIEVE REPORT statement can produce simple formatted re-
ports without formatting statements. It also allows the user to over-
ride the default format when more complex reports are required. Re-
ports can either be page-based, printable documents, or table-based
formatted data that can be input by a spreadsheet.

Column headers and, in page-based reports, page headers containing ti-
tle, date, and page numbers are produced automatically. Simple state-
ments (AT TOP, AT BOTTOM) create page headers and trailers for con-
trol breaks, page breaks or a report summary. DEC DATATRIEVE provides
all of its statistical functions and value expressions within the RE-
PORT statement.

Reports can be output in a variety of output formats: table reports
are produced in DTIF format, and page-based reports in DDIF, PostScript[R]
and Text formats. Usage of DDIF and PostScript allows a variety of text
attributes (size, font types, rendition) to be applied to any part of
the report to obtain a boardroom-quality output. These attributes, and
other printing characteristics such as page size and orientation, can
be selected from DEC DATATRIEVE through simple statements without re-
quiring the use of a graphical terminal. Simple character-cell based
reports are also available, using the Text format. Using the CDA[TM]


                                 8

 

converter library, DTIF and DDIF reports can be converted to a vari-
ety of output formats, allowing interoperability with a number of pop-
ular applications.

The Report Writer provides two layout tools: a grid printout of the
CDA report layout with placement of rows and columns, including those
with varying font types, and graphical printout of the layout page,
with placement of the different report objects (such as header, footer,
body)

Reports can be generated from data stored in RMS files, Oracle CODA-
SYL DBMS and Oracle Rdb databases. Reports can also be generated from
other databases accessed through the use of the appropriate DEC DB In-
tegrator Gateways or DEC DATATRIEVE VIEWS that combine any of these
databases without any change in the syntax of the REPORT statement.

Graphics

DEC DATATRIEVE includes a number of predefined plots invoked with a
single command that takes standard record selection expressions as ar-
guments and creates bar, pie, line, and scattered point plots of the
information selected. Plots can be displayed on Digital Equipment Cor-
poration Graphics terminals such as the VT340 (refer to the OPTIONAL
HARDWARE section for a list of specific supported terminals). Hard copy
can be obtained from terminals by attaching a Digital device which sup-
ports the SIXEL protocol (for example, LA50, LA75). For users with DECwin-
dows, graphics can be displayed in DECterm windows.

The DATATRIEVE Client V1.1 for Windows can display, process, modify,
print plots created by the plot statement, and export the plot using
the clipboard to other applications. Printing to postscript printers
is also supported.

Compatibility

DEC DATATRIEVE for OpenVMS VAX systems and DEC DATATRIEVE for Open-
VMS Alpha systems are highly compatible, with the exception of the sup-
port for floating point definitions, typical of the Alpha platform.


                                 9

 

DEC DATATRIEVE is largely upward compatible from DATATRIEVE-11. DATATRIEVE-11
provides a utility that extracts the contents of a DATATRIEVE-11 dic-
tionary in a format to be entered into Oracle CDD/Repository for Open-
VMS. Some syntactic and semantic differences do exist between DATATRIEVE-11
and DEC DATATRIEVE. Procedures copied with the EXTRACT utility can re-
quire modification.

DEC DATATRIEVE for OpenVMS VAX systems and DEC DATATRIEVE for Open-
VMS Alpha systems are highly compatible, with the exception of the sup-
port for floating point definitions typical of the Alpha platform.

Processor Restrictions:

A TK50 Tape Drive is required for standalone MicroVAX 2000 and VAXs-
tation 2000 systems.

Other Hardware Required:

Mass storage with a minimum of 25,000 disk blocks for DEC DATATRIEVE
system software for VAX Systems.

Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1):

Disk space required for      18,000 blocks
installation:
                             (15.3 Mbytes)

Disk space required for      20,000 blocks
use (permanent):
                             (10.2 Mbytes)

These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
system environment, configuration, and software options.

Memory Requirements for DECwindows Support:

The minimum supported memory for this application running in a stan-
dalone DECwindows environment with both the client and server execut-
ing on that same system is 8M bytes.

The performance and memory usage of DECwindows applications are par-
ticularly sensitive to system configuration. Less memory may be re-
quired on the client system (the system where the software is installed
and executed) if the server (the component that displays the appli-
cation) resides on another system. More memory may be required on a
system with several applications running, or where it may be desir-
able to improve the performance of an application.
