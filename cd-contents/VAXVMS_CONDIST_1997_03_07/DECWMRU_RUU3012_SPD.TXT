 INTERNATIONALIZATION FEATURES
 
 Locale Switching

 DECwindows Motif OpenVMS User Interface/Russkij V1.2-3 provides a plat-
 form for developing locale-independent windowing applications. Appli-
 cations developed using the technologies of X11R5 and OSF/Motif R1.2.3
 toolkit can exhibit different local language behavior according to the
 locale setting.

 DECwindows Motif OpenVMS User Interface/Russkij V1.2-3 is based on the
 XPG locale model. Users can switch the language of an application by
 specifying the locale at startup time. This locale switching mecha-
 nism is also designed to be interoperable with other DECwindows 
 Motif products, such as DEC OSF/1 and ULTRIX Worksystem Software.

 DECwindows Motif OpenVMS User Interface/Russkij V1.2-3 supports a co-
 existence of different language variants on the same computing sys-
 tem, with the possibility of changing easily from one language to an-
 other.

 User Environment, Out-of-the-box Applications and Examples

 All out-of-the-box (OOTB) applications and utilities (with the excep-
 tion of Notepad and DECwindows Mail which are based on OSF/Motif R1.1.3)
 supported by internationalized DECwindows Motif are based on OSF/Motif
 R1.2.

 Input Server

 Local language input methods have been implemented according to the
 X11R5 X Input Method specification at the Xlib layer.

 The input server can support applications developed on X11R4 Asian 
 Input Method (AIM) and X11R5 X Input Method (XIM).

 The X11R5 XIM specification defines the following interaction styles:

 1. Root window - pre-edit data is displayed in a window in the input
    server.

 2. Off-the-spot - pre-edit data is displayed in a fixed location of
    the application window, usually right under the application win-
    dow.

 3. Over-the-spot - pre-edit data is displayed in a child window of the
    application which is placed over the current insertion point.

 4. On-the-spot - the input method directs the application through call-
    backs to display the pre-edit data.

 Window Manager allows the user to control the size and placement of
 windows. The OSF/Motif Window Manager is provided as the default win-
 dow manager; users can choose instead to work with the DECwindows XUI
 Window Manager. The window Manager can be chosen by an individual user
 or by a system manager for an entire system.

 FileView

 FileView, a graphical interface to the OpenVMS file system, allows users
 to navigate the file system and to perform operations on files.

 The user interface language of the FileView itself cannot be changed
 without closing the DECwindows session and opening it again.

 DECterm Terminal Emulator

 Memory Requirements for OpenVMS AXP and VAX Systems

 Memory Requirements for OpenVMS AXP Systems

 The minimum amount of memory required for a system user to install,
 boot, and log in to an OpenVMS Alpha system running DECwindows Motif
 OpenVMS Alpha User Interface/Russkij V1.2-3 is 32 MB. Remote execu-
 tion of applications requires an additional system that runs the ap-
 plication while the application is displayed on the local workstation.

 The performance and memory usage of OpenVMS Alpha systems running 
 DECwindows Motif OpenVMS User Interface/Russkij V1.2-3 depend on the 
 system configuration and window and applications usage.

 Memory Requirements for OpenVMS VAX Systems

 The minimum amount of memory required for a system user to install,
 boot, and log in to an OpenVMS VAX system running DECwindows Motif 
 OpenVMS User Interface/Russkij is 12MB. 16MB is highly recommended for a
 more robust performance. Remote execution of applications requires an
 additional system that runs the application while the application is
 displayed on the local workstation.

 The performance and memory usage of OpenVMS VAX systems running 
 DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS VAX depend on system configuration and 
 window and applications usage.

 Supported Multiscreen Configurations

 DECwindows Motif supports workstations with multiple screens. On the
 Alpha operating system, a multiscreen configuration consists of a 
 single DEC 2000 or DEC 3000 series workstation that supports multiple
 graphics options. A graphics option consists of a graphics controller
 and a monitor.
