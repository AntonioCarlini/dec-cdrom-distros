 PRODUCT NAME:  Terminal Server Manager, V2.1           SPD 27.64.09

 DESCRIPTION

 Terminal Server Manager (TSM) software allows suitably privileged users
 on an OpenVMS VAX or OpenVMS AXP host to examine and control the state
 of terminal servers on the extended local area network (LAN). TSM pro-
 vides centralization and increased flexibility in configuring, mon-
 itoring, and controlling Digital Equipment Corporation's family of ter-
 minal and access servers.

 Enhancements added to this version of TSM expand support of TSM to Open-
 VMS AXP environments and provide mangement support for Digital's lat-
 est versions of access server hardware and software. Hardware support
 now includes the DECserver 900TM. Software support includes DECserver
 Network Access software V1.3 available for DECserver 700, DECserver
 90TL, DECserver 90M, and DECserver 900TM.

 Features

 Management Directory

 TSM provides a database that contains the name, Ethernet address, ter-
 minal server type, and other access and reference information for each
 server to be managed. Through the information in this database, the
 user needs to refer only to the name of the server to gain access.

 Server Selection

 TSM provides a USE command to allow selection of a server or servers
 to be managed. TSM allows the user to manage a group of servers with


                               DIGITAL                      May 1994

 a single command. TSM provides several methods of creating or address-
 ing groups of servers; by specifying terminal server type, a prede-
 fined partition name, or both, the user is able to conveniently man-
 age the appropriate group of terminal servers.

 Volatile Characteristics

 TSM manages the volatile characteristics for all terminal server types.
































                                  2

 

 Permanent Characteristics

 TSM manages permanent NVRAM (Non-Volatile RAM) characteristics for the
 DECserver 100, DECserver 200, DECserver 250, DECserver 300, DECserver
 90L, DECserver 90L+, DECserver 90M, DECserver 90TL, DECserver 700, DEC-
 server 900TM, MUXserver 100, MUXserver 300, MUXserver 320, and MUXserver
 380 terminal servers. For the Ethernet Terminal Server and DECserver
 500 terminal servers, TSM modifies the permanent attributes contained
 within the image files that are downline loaded to those servers.

 Terminal Server Trigger

 Capability via TSM that will cause the server to load with whatever
 server software is specified in NVRAM.

 DECnet Database Modification

 TSM automatically updates the DECnet database for servers to match the
 DECnet related information in the management directory. It is not nec-
 essary for users to employ a separate DSV$CONFIGURE, DSVCONFIG, or TSVNCP
 configuration program.

 3270 Option Software

 TSM provides support for the 3270 Option Software for the CXM04 line
 card. This line card provides the capability to connect the 3270 class
 of terminals to systems on Ethernet.

 Keyboard Mapping

 This functionality enables the terminal server manager to customize
 3270 keyboard tables supplied with the 3270 Option Software, by chang-
 ing the way individual 3270 keyboard keys are mapped to Digital's VT220
 keys.

 User Interface

 TSM supports commands issued both from the DCL command line, as well
 as commands issued from the TSM prompt.

                                  3

 

 By default, TSM checks the syntax of all commands before they are trans-
 mitted to the terminal server. TSM also provides a way to disable this
 syntax checking. Even with the TSM syntax checking disabled, the ter-
 minal server will still do its own syntax checking. This feature is
 provided in anticipation that TSM could support future versions of ter-
 minal server software (and new commands) with the current version of
 TSM.

 Command Files

 Command files may be maintained outside TSM (e.g., by use of an ed-
 itor). This command file support allows values of characteristics to
 be stored on the host, effectively creating a copy of the permanent
 database that may be used to configure new servers. Server maintenance
 is also enhanced by allowing the terminal server to be easily box swapped
 and parameters reset. Up to eight parameters may be passed to TSM com-
 mand files. Additionally, command files may operate on a single server,
 on a logical group (a partition) of servers, or on all servers.

 Fault Management

 Centralized troubleshooting within the terminal server network is en-
 hanced by TSM providing the ability to read counters and status in-
 formation from every terminal server. This information can be used to
 anticipate traffic load and failure conditions for the servers on the
 network. With the ``PASTHRU'' command, the user can also connect di-
 rectly to the server, using a different method of connecting to the
 server, allowing isolation of problems between TSM and the server.

 A simple connectivity test to a specific server or all servers listed
 in the directory is provided with an informational message displayed
 for each server not responding. TSM allows the user to check period-
 ically for non-functioning terminal servers. This function could be
 implemented in a batch job which would notify the appropriate person-
 nel when a server problem is detected.

 Via the TEST DELAY command, users can measure timing delays associ-
 ated with data transmission to and from servers.

 The TEST CONNECTION command tests the ability to submit a print job
 to a server port.

 tions servers:
