     PRODUCT NAME:  InfoServer 100 Software, Version 1.1 SPD 33.20.01

     DESCRIPTION

     InfoServer 100 Software is the software component of a special-
     purpose hardware/software system that makes up an InfoServer
     100 Ethernet-based virtual disk server. This product supports
     locally attached SCSI removable CDROMs and SCSI disk storage.

     The server contains 4 MB of memory (3 MB of cache), an internal
     RZ23 drive (100 MB), and either one or two integral RRD40 CDROM
     drives (635 MB each).

     The InfoServer 100 supports up to 100 concurrent clients. Sup-
     ported clients are listed in the Client Support Matrix table in
     this Software Product Description (SPD).

     Virtual disks, both physical disk media and sets of logical
     disk blocks, can be served to the network by the InfoServer
     100. InfoServer 100 is the server component in a client-server
     model. Client systems running the appropriate client software
     can connect to virtual disks served by the InfoServer 100 and
     use them as though they were locally attached devices. Together,
     the clients and servers form a LAN-based network in which server
     based storage can be accessed from client systems.

     InfoServer 100 Software is factory-installed on the server
     hardware. The server boots when powered on, requiring little
     or no management for the default mode of operation.

     Software protocols provide remote access to the server on the
     LAN. These protocols are Local Area Transport (LAT) for remote
     management, Local Area Disk (LAD) and Local Area Systems Trans-
     port (LAST) for virtual disk access, and Maintenance Operations
     Protocol (MOP) for down-line loading.

     InfoServer 100 operation across low-speed bridges is possible,
     however, the underlying LAST protocol assumes a low rate of
     packet loss. Therefore, low-speed bridges may cause significant
     performance degradation. For this reason, operation of the
     InfoServer is supported only over 10 megabit bridges.

     Features

     Pre-installation of InfoServer 100 Software with Simplified
     Updating

     The InfoServer 100 Software is factory-installed on the internal
     RZ23 disk. Installation of the InfoServer 100 Software is not
     required. The server boots when powered on. A simple server
     command is provided for updating the InfoServer 100 Software
     from CDROM.

     Autoconfiguration

     The server autoconfigures memory and devices and automatically
     creates service names for media present on the server.

     Local and Remote Management Capability

     The server can be managed by either a locally attached con-
     sole or a remote Local Area Transport (LAT) terminal. Local
     and remote console capabilities include configuration manage-
     ment, diagnostic information (built-in self-test and diagnostic
     messages) and server control.

     A local console is not required for the default mode of unat-
     tended operation, but may be helpful in diagnosing certain types
     of server problems.

     Password Protected Management Interface

     A password-protected management interface allows control and
     monitoring of server activity, with auto-prompting at any point
     in the command sequence, command line recall, and built-in help.

     Access Control

        Server Access Control

        Every InfoServer and its corresponding set of clients is a
        member of a single workgroup. A work group is a mechanism
        used by the InfoServer software to logically subdivide the
        InfoServer network. Client systems and InfoServers must
        belong to the same work group for clients to access virtual
        disks on the InfoServer. Up to 1024 workgroups can coexist in
        a single LAN.

        Management Interface Access Control

        o  Password protection

        o  LAT group codes

        Device Access Control

        o  Password protection

        o  Concurrent usage quotas

     Multiple Read/Write Virtual Disks on a Single Physical Disk

     The InfoServer 100 can serve read/write disk partitions. A
     partition is a logical subset of a read/write disk. A single
     disk can be subdivided into several partitions, each of which
     can be served to the network independently as a virtual disk.
     The access mode supports a single writer or multiple readers,
     but not both concurrently (to prevent accidental corruption of
     data on the disk).

     Read/Write Data Back-Up

     InfoServer 100 Software, Version 1.1                SPD 33.20.01



     Back-up operations can be performed locally via server commands
     or remotely using client-specific utilities.

     File System Independence

     InfoServer 100 is a "virtual disk" server. InfoServer 100 does
     not impose a file system on the virtual disks that it serves,
     instead the client system interprets the on-disk structure.
     Multiple on-disk structures can be served on a single InfoServer
     100 simultaneously. InfoServer 100 is capable of automatically
     serving ODS-2, High Sierra, and ISO 9660 disk formats. Other
     disk formats may be served manually through the InfoServer
     management interface.

     Automatic Failover to Duplicate Media

     Server protocols are designed to allow client systems to perform
     automatic failover between duplicate media. The implementation
     of failover varies from client to client.

     Load Balancing

     InfoServer 100 dynamically calculates a service rating for
     virtual disks based upon load. These ratings are used by some
     client systems when connections are requested. When the same
     disk is offered more than once on the network, load balancing is
     provided. This includes the ability to load balance connections
     within a single InfoServer 100 when duplicate virtual disks are
     present, as well as between multiple InfoServers with duplicate
     media on the network. Client systems will select the highest
     rated service.

     Initial System Load

     Some client systems implement Initial System Load (ISL) using
     a combination of server implemented down-line load and virtual
     disk capabilities. This feature eliminates the need for locally
     attached software distribution devices on those client systems.
