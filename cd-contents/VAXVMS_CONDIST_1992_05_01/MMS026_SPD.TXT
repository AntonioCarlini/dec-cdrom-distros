          PRODUCT NAME:  VAX DEC/MMS, Version 2.6             SPD 26.03.13

          DESCRIPTION

          VAX DEC/MMS is a software tool designed to enhance programmer
          productivity. It determines what components in a described
          software system have changed, and rebuilds the system in an
          optimal way.

          When some modules of a software system are modified, dependent
          modules may need to be recompiled. VAX DEC/MMS determines which
          modules need to be recompiled, and performs the appropriate
          actions to ensure that the software system is recompiled and
          linked with all the latest changes. Additionally, VAX DEC/MMS
          has the ability to interact with VAX DEC/CMS (Code Management
          System, SPD 25.52.xx) and other VMS software productivity tools.

          VAX DEC/MMS is included in the VAXset (SPD 27.07.xx) software
          development tool package. This package provides simplified
          ordering and maintenance of various tools. See the appropriate
          Software Product Descriptions for more information on VAXset.

          o  Can access VAX CDD/Plus definitions

          Note:   Installations utilizing VAX Ada should note that many of
                  the features of VAX DEC/MMS are duplicated by the ACS
                  library manager subsystem for Ada-encoded programs. VAX
                  DEC/MMS retains its benefits as a productivity aide for
                  such installations primarily for non-Ada programming.

          HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

          VAX, MicroVAX, VAXstation, or VAXserver configuration as speci-
          fied in the System Support Addendum (SSA 26.03.13.-x).

          SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

          o  VMS Operating System

          On VMS workstations running windowing software, VAX DEC/MMS
          may be used in terminal emulator windows (for example, from
          DECterm). VAX DEC/MMS does not have a DECwindows user interface.

          Refer to the System Support Addendum (SSA 26.03.13-x) for the
          availability and versions of required software.
