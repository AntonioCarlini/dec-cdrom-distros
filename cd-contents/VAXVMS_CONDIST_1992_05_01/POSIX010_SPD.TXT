     PRODUCT NAME:  VMS POSIX, Version 1.0               SPD 34.82.00

     DESCRIPTION

     POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface for Computing Envi-
     ronments) is a set of standards and draft standards that have
     been generated by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic En-
     gineers (IEEE) and supported by organizations such as the Inter-
     national Organization for Standardization (ISO). POSIX defines
     a set of interface standards for various parts of an operating
     system. Because of the consistency they afford applications at
     the operating system level, the POSIX standards are an essential
     underpinning of open systems computing environments.

     VMS POSIX is one of Digital Equipment Corporation's responses
     as a software vendor to the industry POSIX effort, and is a
     cornerstone of VMS open systems capabilities. (Digital's ULTRIX
     and VAXELN systems also offer support for POSIX standards.)
     VMS POSIX provides the capability on VMS to develop and run
     applications conforming to the POSIX standards.

     VMS POSIX includes support for the standards and draft stan-
     dards for the system application programming interface (POSIX
     1003.1), shell and utilities (1003.2), and real-time programming
     (1003.4). POSIX 1003.1 has been approved as a final standard.
     POSIX 1003.2 and 1003.4 are mature drafts that are currently be-
     ing considered and evaluated by the standards community. (For a
     listing of the specific standards supported by VMS POSIX, refer
     to the VMS POSIX Supported Standards (Components) section.)

     User Environments:

     o  Program Development Environment

        The program development environment for VMS POSIX allows the
        use of tools from both the VMS development environment and
        the POSIX environment. Program developers who choose to work
        at DCL level can use the VMS program development environ-
        ment tools, including the VAX C compiler, the VMS Linker,
        and VMS Debugger, as well as application building tools in-
        cluded in VAXset. Program developers who choose to work at
        the VMS POSIX shell level can use the POSIX environment de-
        fined in P1003.2, including "c89" (for linking and compiling
        programs), "make" (for building applications), and "ar" (for
        archiving library entries).

     o  Interactive User Environment

        The interactive user environment for VMS POSIX provides
        the user with a set of UNIX[R]-like commands and utilities
        that include functions similar to DCL (the command "ls" is
        equivalent to the DCL command, "DIRECTORY"), in addition to
        functions unavailable in the DCL environment.

     o  End User Environment (Running POSIX Programs)

        VMS POSIX programs are run from either DCL level or the VMS
        POSIX shell. A captive account can also be created, in which
        a user who accesses the system is limited to running one or
        more POSIX applications.

     POSIX Standards:

     o  POSIX 1003.1

        POSIX 1003.1 is an approved standard, adopted by the IEEE and
        endorsed by X/Open, ANSI, and ISO. It is the standard most
        commonly supported by system vendors today.

        POSIX 1003.1 defines a standard for basic system services
        on an operating system, and describes how system services
        can be used by POSIX applications. These services allow an

                                     2

        application to perform operations such as process creation
        and execution, file system access, and I/O device management.

     o  POSIX 1003.2

        POSIX 1003.2 is not yet a formal standard, but close to
        formal approval. It provides both a callable and interactive
        interface to shell and utility services.

        The 1003.2-based interactive interface to VMS POSIX is a set
        of UNIX-like commands and utilities. The VMS POSIX command
        language interpreter (shell) has many of the functions and
        features of the Korn Shell. These commands and utilities
        include those that provide functions similar to DCL (the
        command "ls" is equivalent to the DCL command, "DIRECTORY"),
        in addition to functions unavailable in the DCL environment.
        For example, the VMS POSIX shell supports the function of
        "pipes," which allow the output of one command to become
        the input of a subsequent command. The VMS POSIX interactive
        interface also includes a group of complex utilities (such
        as "lex", "yacc", and "awk"), C programming utilities, and a
        text editor ("vi").

        VMS POSIX 1003.2 support also includes a set of callable
        interfaces for executing shell commands, compiling and exe-
        cuting regular expressions, and performing pattern matching.

     o  POSIX 1003.4

        VMS POSIX also implements Draft 9 of the POSIX 1003.4 Stan-
        dard for Real-time Extensions. For applications that have
        real-time computing requirements, these extensions provide
        support for such functions as enhanced interprocess com-
        munication, scheduling and memory management control, and
        asynchronous I/O operations.

     VMS POSIX Supported Standards (Components):

     The following list summarizes the formal and draft POSIX stan-
     dards implemented by VMS POSIX:

     o  POSIX IEEE Std. 1003.1-1988 (NIST, FIPS 151-1)

     VMS POSIX, Version 1.0                             SPD 34.82.00



     o  POSIX IEEE Std. 1003.1-1990 (ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990(E))

     o  Portions of POSIX 1003.1a, Draft 5 and symbolic links and
        associated functions (symlink, readlink, and so on) from
        P1003.1a Draft 4

     o  Callable functions from POSIX 1003.2, Draft 10, Appendix B

     o  Shell and Utilities from POSIX 1003.2, Draft 10 and POSIX
        1003.2a, Draft 5

     o  POSIX 1003.4, Draft 9, except for direct (non-buffered)
        I/O, DATLOCK, and TXTLOCK for memory locking, and executable
        access to shared memory

     VMS POSIX Supported Utilities:

     VMS POSIX includes support for the following POSIX 1003.2 utili-
     ties:

     o  All of the "Mandatory" utilities

     o  Software Development Utilities, "make" and "ar"

     o  C Development Utilities, "c89", "yacc", and "lex"

     o  FORTRAN "asa" Development Utility

     o  Shell extensions and some utilities from the User Portability
        Extension (UPE), 1003.2a

     VMS POSIX Support for Draft Standards:

     POSIX is comprised of a number of standards. The only formal
     standards to date are POSIX 1003.1 for basic system interfaces
     and POSIX 1003.3.1, the test assertions a vendor must test to
     claim conformance to POSIX 1003.1. Draft standards, such as
     POSIX 1003.2 and POSIX 1003.4, which are implemented in VMS
     POSIX, are not formal standards. They are working documents that
     will evolve over time before becoming final standards.

     VMS POSIX, Version 1.0                             SPD 34.82.00



     VMS POSIX implements the draft standards for POSIX 1003.2 (Draft
     10) and POSIX 1003.4 (Draft 9) to allow customers to start
     to use and become familiar with these standards in advance of
     formal standards approval.

     As VMS POSIX adds support for evolving and final standards,
     customers may want to modify their POSIX applications to conform
     to the latest version of these standards. To assist customers in
     migrating to future versions, the VMS POSIX documentation will
     include information describing the differences between releases.

     It should be noted that because Draft standards are working
     documents and not formal standards, Digital will support the use
     of a given draft standard only until the functionality provided
     by that draft is superseded in a new version of VMS POSIX. Draft
     standards are continually evolving, often in an incompatible
     way, and are often too unstable for Digital to offer the levels
     of backward compatibility and formal support for older versions
     to which VMS customers are accustomed.

     POSIX Conformance and Certification:

     VMS POSIX conforms to both the POSIX 1003.1-1990 standard as
     specified by ISO/IEC 9945-1, and the 1003.1-1988 version of the
     POSIX standard. The POSIX standard requires that suppliers who
     claim conformance provide a conformance document that describes
     how the supplier implements the standard. This is the only proof
     of conformance required by the IEEE.

     POSIX 1003.1 is the only POSIX standard for which any kind of
     verification exists. (Because POSIX 1003.2 and 1003.4 are draft
     standards, there is no formal method of testing conformance.)

     In the United States, the National Institute of Standards and
     Technology (NIST) has developed a test suite, called the POSIX
     Conformance Test Suite or PCTS. The PCTS tests for conformance
     to NIST's Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS 151-1),
     which is based on POSIX 1003.1-1988. VMS POSIX conforms to the
     POSIX 1003.1-1988 standard as required by the FIPS 151-1.
