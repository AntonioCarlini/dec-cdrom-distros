   PRODUCT NAME:  DEC DB Integrator, Version 3.1A         SPD 47.25.03

   DESCRIPTION

   DEC DB Integrator (DBI) is a multi-database management system that pro-
   vides users with the capability to transparently access and update data
   stored in multiple databases, in distributed locations, and with mul-
   tiple data formats. DEC DB Integrator enables users and applications
   to access this data as if it were located in a single, local database
   without regard to the actual location of the data or to the functional
   limitations of the underlying data managers.

   Client applications based on Microsoft[R] Open Database Connectivity
   (ODBC), SQL/Services, SequeLink[TM] and Data Access Language (DAL) Ap-
   plications Programming Interfaces (APIs) can access DBI servers over
   DECnet, TCP/IP, AppleTalk[R] and IPX/SPX[1] network transports. These
   applications access underlying data sources via a full-featured im-
   plementation of SQL data manipulation language (DML).

   DBI includes software and licensing required to support access by ODBC
   and SQL/Services clients. SequeLink client applications require the
   SequeLink Server for DB Integrator installed on the DBI server sys-
   tem. Data Access Language (DAL) applications on Macintosh[R] clients
   can access DBI servers through the use of DAL client/server software
   available from Independence Technologies.




   ____________________
 [1] The IPX/SPX transport is supported by ODBC and SQL/Services clients

     only.

   DEC DB Integrator, Version 3.1A                       SPD 47.25.03


   DEC DB Integrator provides clients with both remote request and dis-
   tributed request capabilities against underlying data sources. These
   sources, called link databases, include Oracle Rdb, Oracle CODACYL DBMS,
   IBM[R] DB2[TM], ORACLE[R], SYBASE[R] databases, Digital Standard M (DSM)
   globals, VMS RMS files and VSAM data sets. Data sources other than Or-
   acle Rdb are accessed through DB Integrator gateways.

   The DB Integrator Gateway for EDA/SQL[TM] and the DB Integrator Gate-
   way for SequeLink extend this integrated access to INGRES[R], INFORMIX[R],
   AS/400, DB2/6000, DB2/2 and the many other data sources accessible via
   SequeLink and EDA/SQL servers.

   The DEC DBI Gateway for Custom Drivers enables integrated access to
   data sources that are not accessible though the existing set of DBI
   gateways.

   Features

   o  Multi-Database Management - Information from multiple link databases
      can be integrated into a single federated database through the use
      of DEC DB Integrator and the required DEC DB Integrator gateways.

      Users can directly query DEC DB Integrator metadata to determine
      the availability and source of data within the federated database.

   o  Local Autonomy - Link databases are managed as independent enti-
      ties; DB Integrator imposes no restrictions on other uses of the
      underlying databases. Synchronizing DEC DB Integrator metadata with
      corresponding metadata in the link databases is accomplished through
      two DBA functions: one to update the DEC DB Integrator metadata for
      a specific table, the other to refresh only the table's statistics.

   o  Location Transparency - Remote and local data sources are accessed
      as if they reside in a single, local database. Tables may be joined
      with each other independent of the location of the link databases
      in which they physically reside.

   o  Functional Transparency - All data is accessed via a single imple-
      mentation of ANSI/ISO standard DEC SQL. Link database capabilities
      are supplemented by services provided by DBI and DBI gateways so
      that clients have access to a single, uniformly functional, fed-
      erated database.

      Some capabilities, such as identifying a record by its internal database
      object identifier (DB Key) or integration with DECdtm, the Digital
      implementation of the two phase commit (2PC) protocol, depend to-
      tally on link database capabilities and are not available for all
      link databases.

   o  Partitioned Views - Several similar tables located at different sites
      can be presented to clients as a single, horizontally partitioned
      table.

   o  Client Interoperability - Client applications with interfaces to
      the included ODBC drivers for MS Windows and Windows NT or the SQL
      /Services API can access DEC DB Integrator services via a SQL/Services
      server and DECnet, TCP/IP, AppleTalk or IPX/SPX network transports[2].

   o  Compatibility - Applications designed to work with DEC SQL data ma-
      nipulation language (DML) through either the compiled or dynamic
      SQL interfaces will work with DEC DB Integrator without any mod-
      ification other than changing the database name.

   o  Performance - DB Integrator accelerates the response time of com-
      plex queries/updates through distributed optimization techniques
      designed to minimize the movement of data across the network. The
      DB Integrator distributed query optimizer is both cost-based and
      capabilities-based resulting in efficient strategies for process-
      ing of user requests. Runaway queries may be controlled by limit-
      ing the CPU time, elapsed time and/or the rows returned by a spe-
      cific client request.

   DEC DB Integrator, Version 3.1A                       SPD 47.25.03


   o  Distributed Unit of Work Support - DEC DB Integrator uses DECdtm
      services to provide a transparent, two phase commit (2PC) for dis-
      tributed transactions that span multiple Oracle Rdb databases, Or-
      acle CODACYL DBMS databases or RMS files. DEC DB Integrator may be
      configured to allow distributed updates across link databases that
      lack DECdtm support. These updates may produce inconsistent results.

      Statement atomicity in distributed transactions is ensured through
      the use of the markpoint capabilities of the link database managers.

      For more information on DECdtm refer to the Digital UNIX[R] AXP Op-
      erating System SPD (41.61.xx), the OpenVMS AXP Operating System SPD
      (42.18.xx) or the OpenVMS VAX Operating System SPD (25.01.xx).

   o  Security - DEC DB Integrator presents itself to the link databases
      as a user. Both responsibility for, and control of data access re-
      mains with the administrators of these link databases. Database ad-
      ministrators can control access to DEC DB Integrator metadata through
      privilege-based security mechanisms. DEC DB Integrator encrypts the
      proxy information it uses to attach to link databases.

   o  Data Type Support - All DEC SQL data types are supported. Data types
      unique to the link database managers are transparently mapped to
      corresponding DEC SQL data types.

   o  Language Support - Precompilers for DEC Ada, DEC C, Digital UNIX
      C, DEC COBOL, DEC Fortran, DEC Pascal, and PL/I for OpenVMS are avail-
      able with the purchase of a Full Development Option.[3]

   o  Data Integrity - Access to link databases will not override the busi-
      ness rules established in, and enforced by, the data managers of
      those databases.


   ____________________
 [3] The availability of language precompiler support varies by platform.
     Refer to the SOFTWARE LICENSING section of this SPD for a descrip-

     tion of language precompiler support by platform.

   Disk Space Requirements

   Table 1 lists the disk space required to install and operate DBI soft-
   ware by hardware/operating system platform (Platform). The common re-
   quirement represents the space required to store software objects that
   are common to DBI and the DB Integrator family of gateways. If one of
   these products is already installed on the system or cluster, the per-
   manent disk space requirement will be decreased by this amount.
