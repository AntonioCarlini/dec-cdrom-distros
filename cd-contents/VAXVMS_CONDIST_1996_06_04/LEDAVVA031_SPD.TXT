   PRODUCT NAME:  DEC DB Integrator Gateway for           SPD 47.34.02
                  EDA/SQL[TM], Version 3.1A

   DESCRIPTION

   DEC DB Integrator Gateway for EDA/SQL (EDA/SQL Gateway) provides ap-
   plications and tools with direct, read-only access to databases served
   by EDA/SQL servers. This access can be via interactive or dynamic SQL
   interfaces. Client/server access is enabled by drivers for Microsoft[R]
   Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) applications. Optional support for
   embedded SQL and SQL module language programming is available.

   DEC DB Integrator (DBI) extends the functionality of the EDA/SQL Gate-
   way by providing a native integration of databases accessed by EDA/SQL
   Gateways and other DB Integrator gateways. DBI clients may directly
   access and join views of tables existing on multiple databases. These
   views may be horizontally or vertically partitioned and be based on
   tables existing on any database accessible by these gateways. DBI views
   may be pre-defined or dynamically declared.

   DBI servers maintain a persistent catalog of metadata extracted from
   databases served by EDA/SQL servers. DBI uses this metadata along with
   information on network and underlying database manager capabilities
   to optimize cross-database joins.

   The EDA/SQL Gateway is available on the Digital UNIX[R] Operating Sys-
   tem on AXP systems, workstations and servers and on the OpenVMS Op-
   erating System on Digital AXP and VAX systems, workstations and servers.

   DEC DB Integrator Gateway for                         SPD 47.34.02
   EDA/SQL[TM], Version 3.1A

   The EDA/SQL Gateway provides direct, read-only access to EDA/SQL data
   sources through standard DEC SQL interfaces. These interfaces include
   a dynamic SQL interface, an interactive SQL facility and the SQL/Services
   server.

   SQL data manipulation language (DML) is fully supported. SQL data def-
   inition language (DDL) is not supported.

   The dynamic SQL interface compiles and executes SQL requests passed
   through its call interface. This programming approach is highly ef-
   fective in applications such as ad-hoc query access where the exact
   parameters of requests are not known until runtime. It is compatible
   with any programming language that supports the operating system's call-
   ing standards. The dynamic memory handling capabilities of Ada, C and
   P/I enable these languages to take full advantage of the power and flex-
   ibility of this approach.

   The interactive SQL facility supports the interactive query of databases
   accessed through EDA/SQL servers. Required data format translations
   are automatically performed.

   EDA/SQL Server Support

   EDA/SQL supports many network protocols and server platforms. Data sources
   accessible through EDA/SQL servers include: ADABASE[R], ALLBASE/SQL,
   Btrieve, C-ISAM[R], CA-Datacom/DB, CA-IDMS/DB, DB2[TM], DB2/2, DB2/6000,
   dBASE[R]), IMS/DB, INFORMIX[R], INGRES[R], MUMPS[R], NonStop SQL, PACE,
   SQL/DS, Supra Server, System 2000, TOTAL, Teradata, TurboIMAGE, UL-
   TRIX/SQL, Unify, VSAM and ASCII files. Contact Information Builders
   for current information on EDA/SQL supported data sources.

   Connectivity to a specific EDA/SQL server depends on the existence of
   a common network transport between the EDA/SQL server platform and the
   EDA/SQL Gateway Platform.

   DEC DB Integrator Gateway for                         SPD 47.34.02
   EDA/SQL[TM], Version 3.1A

   The EDA/SQL Gateway includes ODBC drivers for Microsoft Windows[TM]
   and Windows NT. These drivers enable read access to databases via EDA/SQL
   servers over DECnet, TCP/IP and Novell[R] NetWare[R] (IPX/SPX) trans-
   ports. Network transport alternatives depend on the selected desktop
   and EDA/SQL Gateway platforms. [1]

   Performance

   The EDA/SQL Gateway selects access strategies that minimize data trans-
   fer activity. Wherever possible, selection, filtering, and statisti-
   cal operations are managed by the EDA/SQL server. A log of communi-
   cations activity and errors may be maintained to assist in problem iso-
   lation and evaluation.

   Disk Space Requirements

   Table 1 lists the disk space required to install and operate DBI soft-
   ware by hardware/operating system platform (Platform). The common re-
   quirement represents the space required to store software objects that
   are common to DBI and the DB Integrator family of gateways. If one of
   these products is already installed on the system or cluster, the disk
   space requirement will be decreased by this amount.

   These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
   sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
   system environment, configuration, and software options selected.

   Additional space must be allowed for programs, logs, temporary database
   cache files and user interface software.

   CLUSTER ENVIRONMENT

   This product is fully supported when installed on any valid and li-
   censed VAXcluster or VMScluster configuration. These configurations
   are described in the VAXcluster SPD (SPD 29.78.xx), and the VMSclus-
   ter SPD (SPD 42.18.xx).

   SERVER SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

   This section lists the software required to install and operate the
   EDA/SQL Gateway.

   Support of DEC ODBC Driver for MS Windows and DEC ODBC Driver for Windows
   NT client applications may require additional software. With the re-
   quired software, all EDA/SQL gateways support access via DECnet and
   TCP/IP transports. In addition, the OpenVMS VAX gateway may be accessed
   through the Novell NetWare (IPX/SPX) transport.
