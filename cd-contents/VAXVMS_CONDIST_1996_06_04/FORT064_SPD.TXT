           PRODUCT NAME:  Digital Fortran Version 6.4 for OpenVMS VAX Systems  
           SPD 25.16.48

           DESCRIPTION

           Digital Fortran is an implementation of full language FORTRAN-77, 
	   conforming to American National Standard FORTRAN, ANSI X3.9-1978. 
	   It includes optional support for programs conforming to the 
	   previous standard, ANSI X3.9-1966. Digital Fortran meets the 
	   Federal Information Processing Standard Publication (FIPS-69-1) 
	   requirements by conforming to the ANSI Standard and by including a 
	   flagger. The flagger optionally produces diagnostic messages for 
	   compile-time elements that do not conform to the Full-Level ANSI 
 	   FORTRAN X3.9-1978 Standard. Digital Fortran also conforms to the 
	   International Standard ISO 1539-1980(E) and to MIL-STD 1753.

           Digital Fortran includes the following language enhancements to the
           ANSI/ISO standard:

           o  INCLUDE statement

           o  Use of the exclamation point (!) for end of line comments

           o  31-character identifiers that can include dollar sign ($) and un-
              derscore (_)

           o  IMPLICIT NONE statement

           o  Explicit specification of storage allocation units for data types
              such as LOGICAL*4, INTEGER*4, REAL*4, REAL*8, and COMPLEX*8.

           o  A set of data types beyond those specified by full language 
	      FORTRAN-77:

              -  1-byte and 2-byte short integers (BYTE, INTEGER*1, INTEGER*2)

              -  1-byte and 2-byte short logicals (LOGICAL*1, LOGICAL*2)

              -  Quadruple-precision real (REAL*16)

           Digital Fortran Version 6.4 for OpenVMS VAX Systems
           SPD 25.16.48

           o  I/O unit numbers can be any integer value in the range of 0 and 
	      119

           The Digital Fortran compiler provides a multi-phase optimizer that is
           capable of performing optimizations across entire program units.

           Specific optimizations performed include:

           o  Constant folding

           o  Optimizations of arithmetic IF, logical IF, and block IF-THEN-ELSE

           o  Global common subexpression elimination

           o  In-line expansion of statement functions

           o  Removal of invariant expressions from loops

           o  Optimization of array addressing in loops

           o  Value propagation

           o  Deletion of redundant and unreachable code

           o  Optimized interface to intrinsic functions

           o  Improved generated code for references to dummy arguments and 
	      variables in COMMON

           o  Improved generated code for operations involving COMPLEX variables

           o  Specially optimized scalar code for routines that process large 
	      arrays which can significantly reduce page faults and improve 
	      application performance (selectable with /OPTIMIZE=LEVEL=4)

           Digital Fortran for OpenVMS VAX Systems has additional features that
           support developing applications that take advantage of the VAX vec-
           tor processors or multiprocessor VAX systems.

           o  Support for automatic generation of VAX vector-processor instruc-
              tions

           o  Support for automatic and manual decomposition of programs to im-
              prove performance on multiple-processor OpenVMS VAX systems

           o  Multi-level vectorization and decomposition

           Digital Fortran Version 6.4 for OpenVMS VAX Systems
           SPD 25.16.48

           o  Vectorization of DO loops with both INTEGER*4 and INTEGER*2 loop
              control variables

           o  Vectorization of many intrinsic mathematic functions for operands

           o  Optimized vector code generation for solving dense systems of lin-
              ear equations

           o  Thorough dependence analysis

           o  Compile-time performance analysis to choose the best vectorization
              and/or decomposition method

           o  Integration of vector and scalar optimizations of INTEGER*4, 
	      REAL*4, REAL*8, COMPLEX*8, and COMPLEX*16 types

           o  An ASSERT statement to provide additional information to the com-
              piler about the program. The ASSERT statement can be used in some
              programs to achieve a high degree of vectorization and/or 
	      automatic decomposition. The ASSERT statement can optionally 
	      generate code to verify the assertions at run time, if desired. 
	      ASSERT statements can be specified in directive form for 
  	      portability and will be ignored by other compilers since they 
	      will appear as comments.

           o  The INIT_DEP_FWD directive allows vector processing for many loops
              that would otherwise not qualify due to unknown data dependencies.
              As this directive may change the meaning of the program, Digital
              Equipment Corporation does not warrant execution results conform-
              ing to the Fortran standard when this directive is used.

           o  The NOVECTOR directive to allow the programmer to control the 
	      presence and level of vectorization in each nest of DO-loops

           o  The /MATH_LIBRARY qualifier to support performance optimized vec-
              tor math functions

           o  The /CHECK=ALIGNMENT qualifier to suppress vector alignment excep-
              tions at run time

           o  Generation of diagnostics for vectorization inhibitors

              -  Though some vector inhibition diagnostics will display in the
                 listing and on the terminal, the DEC Language-Sensitive Editor
                 component of the DEC Language-Sensitive Editor/DEC Source Code

           SPD 25.16.48

                 Analyzer is required to display all the vector inhibition di-
                 agnostics generated by the compiler.

           Digital Fortran supports the following native VAX floating point data
           types:

           -  32-bit F_floating data type, with an 8-bit exponent and 23-bit 
	      mantissa, which provides a range of approximately 0.29E-38 to 
	      1.70E38 and a precision of typically 7 decimal digits

           -  64-bit D_floating data type, with an 8-bit exponent and 56-bit 
	      mantissa, which provides a range of approximately 0.29E-38 to 
	      1.70E38 and a precision of typically 16 decimal digits

           -  64-bit G_floating data type, with an 11-bit exponent and 53-bit 
	      mantissa, which provides a range of approximately 0.56E-308 to 
	      0.90E308 and a precision of typically 15 decimal digits

           -  128-bit H_floating data type, with a 15-bit exponent and a 113-bit
              mantissa, which provides a range of approximately 0.84E-4932 to 
	      0.59E4932 and a precision of typically 33 decimal digits

           The shareable, re-entrant compiler operates under the OpenVMS oper-
           ating system. It globally optimizes source programs while taking ad-
           vantage of the native instruction set and the OpenVMS virtual memory
           system.

           TASK
	   ___________________________________________________________________

           Installation: 16,000 blocks (8.0 MB)

           Permanent: 11,000 blocks (5.5 MB)
	   ___________________________________________________________________

           These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
           sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
           system environment, configuration, and software options.

           Parallel Processing Hardware Requirements:

           Multiprocessor VAX systems are required for parallel execution of de-
           composed DO-loops. However, applications that are compiled using the
           Digital Fortran parallel processing options will run correctly on 
	   single-processor systems.

           Vector Processing Hardware Requirements:

           Vector-processor equipped VAX systems are required for proper execu-
           tion of vectorized DO-loops. However, applications that are compiled
           using the vector-processing options will run on all VAX processors,
           using the VAX Vector Instruction Emulation Facility (VVIEF) that is
           supplied with OpenVMS. Execution using the VVIEF may be significantly
           slower than recompiling for scalar execution.

           OPTIONAL HARDWARE

           Digital Fortran for OpenVMS supports the optional vector processing
           hardware on the VAX 9000 and the VAX 6000 Model 400 and VAX 6000 
	   Model 500 processors.

           Floating point intensive applications should be run on configurations
           with the appropriate hardware support for the floating point data 
	   types being used. Consult the base operating system Software 
	   Product Description (SPD) for the Floating Point Accelerator or 
	   other floating point hardware appropriate for your configuration.
