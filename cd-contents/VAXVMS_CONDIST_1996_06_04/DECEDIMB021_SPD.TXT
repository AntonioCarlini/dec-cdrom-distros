          DESCRIPTION

          DEC/EDI offers application developers all the facilities necessary to
          EDI-enable Business Applications within an Enterprise. Electronic Data
          Interchange (EDI) enables users to electronically exchange structured
          business documents such as Purchase Orders, Dispatch Advice and In-
          voices with their Trading Partners using International, National and
          Industry-specific EDI standards. Extensive communication options are
          also provided to facilitate inter-enterprise communication via EDI VANs
          or direct with Trading Partners using OSI[R] protocols.

          DEC/EDI uses a Client/Server architecture to provide EDI services to
          local and remote Business Applications hosted on multi-vendor plat-
          forms within an enterprise.

          DEC/EDI Application Client

          The DEC/EDI Application Client facilitates the integration of local
          and remote Business Applications to the DEC/EDI Server, to make them
          EDI-capable. ObjectBroker (DEC ACA Services) is used to link the lo-
          cally or remotely installed DEC/EDI Application Clients to the DEC/EDI
          Server, using either TCP/IP or DECnet communication protocols.

          DEC/EDI Clients are available today for the OpenVMS VAX, OpenVMS AXP
          and Digital UNIX[R] AXP, HP-UX[R] and IBM[R] AIX[R] platforms. These
          DEC/EDI Application Clients can interoperate with a DEC/EDI Server run-
          ning on either OpenVMS VAX or OpenVMS AXP platforms.

          The interface provided by the DEC/EDI Application Client is file-based
          and allows for the Business Application to POST and FETCH files to and
          from Trading Partners via the DEC/EDI Server.

          The DEC/EDI Application Clients can be invoked via the Command Line
          Interface (CLI) and the Application Program Interface (API). The CLI
          can be run from a suitably coded script file (command file) or invoked
          interactively.

          The DEC/EDI Application Client also provides the following functions:

          o  Enables local and remote Business Applications to extract document
             status information via the TRACK Command, from the DEC/EDI Server.

          o  Enable Business Applications to POST and FETCH files to and from
             other DEC/EDI Application Clients attached to the same DEC/EDI Server.
             The information exchanged between DEC/EDI Application Clients is
             mapped from the input format to the recipiant format by using File-
             Bridge MAPs based on an EDI Message definition.

          o  POST and FETCH documents to and from the DEC/EDI Server and by-pass
             the Mapping or Mapping and Translation functions, for transmission
             and receipt to and from trading partners via the DEC/EDI Communi-
             cation Component.

          DEC/EDI Server

          The DEC/EDI Server consists of the following components which reside
          on the same node:

          o  DEC/EDI FileBridge Component

          o  DEC/EDI Translation Component

          o  DEC/EDI Communications Component

          o  DEC/EDI Operational Management Component

          FileBridge Component

          FileBridge is a table-driven "MAPPER" with a set of data manipulation
          operators for selected classes of commonly encountered EDI applica-
          tion data. This capability is used to convert data from the existing
          Business Application file format to that required for Translation into
          the Trading Partner format as well as formatting data received from
          the trading partner to the file format expected by the Business Ap-
          plication.

          The Mapping Process consists of:

          o  Data Specification

          The customer defines the application file structure, and parameters
          for mapping between the application file and the EDI standard through
          a forms-based user interface. FileBridge then generates a conversion
          table that is used to map data from/to the application file formats.

          o  User Defined Mapping

          FileBridge allows fields to be moved directly to the destination or
          to have built-in mathematical/logical/string operations to be performed
          upon the fields. The user interface guides the user through this pro-
          cess. The user can define and add code through "hooks" for more com-
          plex processing.

          o  Data Definition Extracts

                                           3

 



          DEC/EDI for OpenVMS VAX, Version 2.1A                 SPD 31.70.06


          FileBridge also allows for the extraction of Application file record
          definitions from Oracle[R] CDD/Repository.

          The components of FileBridge are:

          o  FileBridge User Interface (UI)

          The UI consists of a set of menus and forms that allow users to cre-
          ate, modify, and compile FileBridge tables.

          o  FileBridge Run-time

          The Run-time process uses the information in a compiled FileBridge ta-
          ble to map data between the Business Application file and the format
          required for transmission and receipt to and from trading partners.

          Translation Component

          The Translation Component takes data that has come from the Business
          Application and transforms it into the standard EDI formats required
          for transmission to the Trading Partner. It also takes incoming EDI
          data, that has been received from a Trading Partner by the Communi-
          cations Component, and converts it into the format that is suitable
          for the Mapper to decode and pass to the Application Client.

          The Translation Component provides the following features:

          o  Support for multiple versions of messages (transactions) and EDI
             standards

          o  Supports the transmission of 8-bit national character sets

          o  Compliance checking at Trading Partner level

          o  Trading Partner specific Code Translation

          o  User-selectable control number generation

          o  Test transmissions

          o  Event and Error logging

          DEC/EDI for OpenVMS VAX, Version 2.1A                 SPD 31.70.06


          An editor is provided to enable users to customise the messages de-
          livered with the product to create new messages for industry specific
          and Trading Partner specific messages as well as create new messages
          based on ANSI X12, TDCC, EDIFACT, ODETTE, and TRADACOMS[TM] syntax rules
          supported by this version of the product. The editor also allows for
          the creation of new versions of EDI Standard dictionaries.

          Trading Partner agreement details, including the message formats be-
          ing used, are recorded in the Trading Partner Profiles. The Transla-
          tion Component uses the information in the Trading Partner Profiles
          and the Message Database to perform compliance checking and to check
          the validity of the transaction.

          The Translation Component provides support for the following EDI stan-
          dards:

          o  EDIFACT

             -  Implements ISO 9735

          These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
          sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
          system environment, configuration, and software options.

          Additional disk space is required depending on the number of Mapping
          tables, performance needs, message size and software options.

          Memory Requirements

          The minimum memory supported is 64MB. However, the use of this soft-
          ware in conjunction with increased memory and multiple disks improves
          performance. The memory size suggested for most typical hardware con-
          figurations is at least 128MB (especially when the X.25 and/or X.400
          products are installed on the same processor).

          this product may be different from the requirements for the current

          existing MAPs to re-compiled on a system which includes the FileBridge
          Development option, with new releases of DEC/EDI.
