           PRODUCT NAME:  DEC DB Integrator Gateway for PC Data   SPD 63.32.00
                          Version 3.1A

           DESCRIPTION

           DEC DB Integrator Gateway for PC Data (PC Data Gateway) provides ap-
           plications and tools with direct, read/write access to data sources
           which support a Microsoft[TM] Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) in-
           terface. The PC Data Gateway works with ODBC Data Drivers which meet
           the following standard conformance levels:

              ODBC API (Level 1)
              ODBC SQL Grammer (minimum)

           The PC Data Gateway includes the Microsoft ODBC Pack 2 files which in-
           cludes an ODBC administrator, ODBC Driver manager, and ODBC Drivers
           for the following data sources:

              Microsoft ACCESS
              Microsoft Excel
              Microsoft FoxPro
              Microsoft SQL Server
              Borland dBase[TM]
              Borland Paradox[R]
              Btrieve
              text files

           The PC Data Gateway is available on Digital UNIX and OpenVMS Alpha and
           VAX. The client software is installed on these platforms and the server
           software runs on Windows 3.1, Windows 95, and Windows NT platforms.

           The PC Data Gateway can be used to provide remote access to PC Data
           sources from Digital UNIX and OpenVMS platforms. Remote client access

           DEC DB Integrator Gateway for PC Data                 SPD 63.32.00
           Version 3.1A

           is also available through SQL/Services and ODBC drivers which are in-
           cluded as part of the DB Integrator Gateway. (See Desktop Client Soft-
           ware section for a complete list of remote clients supported by the
           PC Data Gateway.)

           DEC DB Integrator (DBI) extends the functionality of the PC Data Gate-
           way by providing a native integration of databases accessed by PC Data
           Gateways and other DB Integrator gateways. DBI clients may directly
           access and join views of tables existing on multiple databases. These
           views may be horizontally or vertically partitioned and be based on
           tables existing on any database accessible by these gateways. DBI views
           may be pre-defined or dynamically declared.

           DBI servers maintain a persistent catalog of metadata extracted from
           databases served by PC Data servers. DBI uses this metadata along with
           information on network and underlying database manager capabilities
           to optimize cross-database joins.

           Features

           Standard SQL Interfaces

           The PC Data Gateway provides direct, read/write access to PC Data data
           sources through standard DEC SQL interfaces. These interfaces include
           a dynamic SQL interface, an interactive SQL facility and the SQL/Services
           server.

           SQL data manipulation language (DML) is fully supported. SQL data def-
           inition language (DDL) is not supported.

           The dynamic SQL interface compiles and executes SQL requests passed
           through its call interface. This programming approach is highly ef-
           fective in applications such as ad-hoc query access where the exact
           parameters of requests are not known until runtime. It is compatible
           with any programming language that supports the operating system's call-
           ing standards. The dynamic memory handling capabilities of Ada, C and
           P/I enable these languages to take full advantage of the power and flex-
           ibility of this approach.

           Version 3.1A

           The interactive SQL facility supports the interactive query of databases
           accessed through PC Data servers. Required data format translations
           are automatically performed.


           Optional SQL Compiler Support

           Support for SQL 3GL application development is available with the op-
           tional purchase of a DEC SQL development licenses. DEC SQL develop-
           ment licenses provide precompiler support for embedded SQL applica-
           tions, a compiler for SQL module language programs and an application
           programming interface (API) to support the development of client/server
           applications.

           Embedded SQL programming places SQL language statements in line with
           host language statements. Precompilers replace these SQL statements
           with call statements and object modules. The modified host language
           program is compiled and linked with the object modules to form an ex-
           ecutable image. Precompilers for DEC C, DEC Ada, DEC COBOL, DEC For-
           tran, DEC Pascal and PL/I for OpenVMS are included.

           Table 1 describes the DEC SQL precomplier support by platform.

           Version 3.1A

           These precompilers support an optional Federal Information Process-
           ing Standards (FIPS) flagger that allows the user to identify any SQL
           statements which are not in the current ANSI/ISO SQL standard. An ex-
           ception flagger for the Multivendor Integration Architecture (MIA) stan-
           dard is also provided.

           The SQL module language processor allows SQL statements and multistate-
           ment procedures to be grouped into modules. When these modules are com-
           piled, the resulting object modules can be linked with objects cre-
           ated by any language compiler that complies with the OpenVMS calling
           standard. The SQL module language compiler also supports FIPS and MIA
           flagging.

           SQL/Services API programming libraries are used to interface client
           applications to the SQL/Services server. MS-DOS[R] or MS Windows client
           applications can be written in Microsoft C. Macintosh[R] client ap-
           plications can be written in MPW[TM] C or ThinkC.

           A DEC SQL development license also includes SQL/Services client pro-
           gramming libraries for Microsoft Windows[TM], Windows NT[TM], Digi-
           tal UNIX, MS-DOS, Sun[R], ULTRIX or OpenVMS platforms.

           The following table summarizes SQL/Services network support. Clients
           other than the DEC ODBC Driver for MS Windows are based on the SQL/Services
           API.

           CONFORMANCE TO STANDARDS

           DB Integrator and all DB Integrator Gateways compile with the Inter-
           national Standard,ISO/IEC 9075:1992 and the American National Stan-
           dard, ANSI X3.135-1992, Database Language SQL, Entry-Level specifi-
           cation, and the Federal Information Processing Standard for Database
           Language SQL (FIPS SQL) as defined in FIPS PUB 127-2.

           The DEC ODBC Driver for MS Windows complies with the Microsoft Open
           Database Connectivity specification V2.0.

           Disk Space Requirements

           Table 3 lists the disk space required to install and operate DBI soft-
           ware by hardware/operating system platform (Platform). The common re-
           quirement represents the space required to store software objects that
           are common to DBI and the DB Integrator family of gateways. If one of
           these products is not already installed on the system or cluster, the
           disk space requirement will be increased by this amount.
