 PRODUCT NAME:  KAP[TM] for DEC Fortran for OpenVMS     SPD 38.50.03

 DESCRIPTION

 This document describes the following two products:

 o  KAP[TM] for DEC Fortran Version 2.0 for OpenVMS AXP

 o  KAP for DEC Fortran Version 1.1 for OpenVMS VAX

 The KAP preprocessors for Fortran are developed by Kuck and Associates,
 Incorporated and are distributed under Digital Equipment Corporation's
 Standard Terms and Conditions. KAP for DEC Fortran is intended to work
 with DEC Fortran on OpenVMS VAX and AXP systems.

 The KAP for DEC Fortran programs are Fortran-language source-to-source
 preprocessors that restructure code for improved performance. Some of
 the transformations provided include function inlining, loop unrolling,
 loop peeling, loop fusion, and BLAS recognition. KAP also optimizes
 the use of registers and cache memory.

 KAP provides a set of default transformations that are effective for
 a wide range of programs. While the default settings make KAP easy to
 use, KAP also provides a large set of command qualifiers and in-source
 directives and assertions that allow the advanced user to customize
 KAP transformations for a particular application program.

 Parallel Decomposition Support

 The OpenVMS VAX version supports the vector and parallel capabilities
 of the VAX Vector Architecture. The OpenVMS AXP version supports the
 parallel capabilities of Alpha AXP SMP systems. KAP provides both au-
 tomatic and directed decomposition of programs.
