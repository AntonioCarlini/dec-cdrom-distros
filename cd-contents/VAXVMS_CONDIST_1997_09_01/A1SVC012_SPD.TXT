 PRODUCT NAME:  ALL-IN-1 DESKtop Server for OpenVMS, Version 1.2 SPD
 31.71.02

 DESCRIPTION

 ALL-IN-1 DESKtop Server for OpenVMS (formerly ALL-IN-1 PC Server for
 VMS) is an ALL-IN-1 layered application that runs on a suitably con-
 figured OpenVMS host computer. It controls the exchange of inbound and
 outbound mailbags between ALL-IN-1 DESKtop users and ALL-IN-1. A mail-
 bag is a single file comprised of one or more electronic mail messages
 and, optionally, their attachments as well as the associated envelope
 header information. The product also recognizes and executes Message
 Based Applications (MBAs) and File Transfer requests. The Server con-
 verts different document types using ALL-IN-1's conversion mechanism,
 the CDA Converter Library, or a third-party product called KEYpak® (if
 installed).

 ALL-IN-1 DESKtop Server for OpenVMS supports ALL-IN-1 DESKtop for DOS,
 Version 1.0 and Version 1.1 and ALL-IN-1 DESKtop for Macintosh®, Ver-
 sion 1.0.

 Note: For the purpose of this Software Product Description, IBM®-compatible
 personal computers and Macintosh computers will be referred to as DESK-
 top.

 The ALL-IN-1 DESKtop product family includes:

 o  ALL-IN-1 DESKtop for DOS (SPD 50.20.xx) - Software supporting DOS
    microcomputers that integrates PC/AT® class desktop computers with
    the services provided by ALL-IN-1.

 o  ALL-IN-1 DESKtop for Macintosh (SPD 55.25.xx) - Software support-
    ing Macintosh computers that integrates Macintosh V6.0 class desk-
    top computers with the services provided by ALL-IN-1.

 Features

 Mail Sorting and Routing

 ALL-IN-1 DESKtop Server for OpenVMS monitors the DESKtop user's in-
 bound mail area for the appearance of new mail and alerts the DESK-
 top user of the availability of the mailbag (if the mailbag watch is
 active). The DESKtop user activates the server, by means of a menu se-
 lection on the DESKtop computer, to carry out a mail exchange (send
 /receive). This mail exchange is accomplished using the appropriate
 transfer protocols available for connecting the PC, Macintosh, and VAX.

 Note: KERMIT is included in this product.

 During mail exchange, proper safeguards are maintained to avoid col-
 lisions with the mail reading/writing process. The server can keep a
 log of all mailbag exchanges.

 The minimum required connection time for a mail exchange is the amount
 of time required to move the available mailbags to and from the PC or
 Macintosh computer.

 Reading/Writing Mail

 All mail is stored and forwarded through ALL-IN-1. For each registered
 user, the ALL-IN-1 DESKtop Server for OpenVMS reads inbound mail from
 the ALL-IN-1 INBOX and writes outbound mail to the ALL-IN-1 OUTBOX.

 The write process of outbound mail starts with an unbagging and sort-
 ing operation. Messages can be ALL-IN-1 mail messages or messages des-
 tined for Message Based Applications. The write process also inter-
 prets all mailbag information pertaining to priority, read receipt,
 addressees, subject, and so forth, and creates an appropriate ALL-IN-1
 message. Addressees are checked for acceptability; any addressee not
 acceptable is not used and a rejection message is returned to the per-
 sonal computer.

 During the read process, the body file and attachments are inspected
 to determine their ability to be converted. Conversion of an attach-
 ment's format is determined by the DESKtop recipient's preferred for-
 mat. Document conversions make use of ALL-IN-1's conversion mechanism,
 the CDA Converter Library, or KEYpak (if installed). Read messages are
 collected with messages from other sources (such as Message Based Ap-
 plications) into a new or existing mailbag and held until the next mail-
 bag exchange is initiated.

 Scheduling

 The Scheduler is a detached process which manages an in-memory, queued
 list of activities for the user. It continuously cycles through its
 queued list of users, searching for new requests to dispatch to one
 of the following servers:

 o  ALL-IN-1 Message Server - a detached process which continuously runs
    an ALL-IN-1 session from within a privileged account. An inbound
    mail request causes the Scheduler to dispatch a "bagging" request
    to the Message Server. Similarly, an outbound mail request causes
    the Scheduler to dispatch an "unbagging" request to the Message Server.

 o  MBA Server - a detached process which processes a given Message Based
    Application upon signal from the Scheduler.

 o  File Transfer Server - a detached process which completes a file
    transfer request dispatched by the Scheduler.

 System Management

 System management is accomplished by means of a menu-driven interface
 for the creation and maintenance of user profile lists, network, and
 printer validation lists. The system manager can broadcast messages
 to the DESKtop user base, start up and shut down the scheduler and the
 three task servers, and do installation testing. This management func-
 tion runs from either the OpenVMS system manager's or the ALL-IN-1 man-
 ager's account.
