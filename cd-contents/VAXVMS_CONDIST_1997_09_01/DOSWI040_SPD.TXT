 PRODUCT NAME:  DIGITAL Office Server Web Interface V4.0
 SPD: 61.55.00

 DESCRIPTION

 The DIGITAL[TM] Office Server Web Interface V4.0 (the "Web Interface")
 enables users of the Internet anywhere in the world to access docu-
 ments and folders in their own personal Office Server drawers and shared
 drawers. From a standard Web browser, the user logs on with user name
 and password authorization to access their personal files on the server.
 In addition, any document placed in a WORLD READ drawer or drawer iden-
 tified as accessible from the Internet can then be accessed from In-
 ternet clients utilizing software such as Netscape Navigator[R] or Mi-
 crosoft[R] Internet Explorer.

 The Web Interface media is installed on the customer's local Web server,
 on the internal side of the Internet firewall, communicating over IP
 with any DIGITAL Office Server or ALL-IN-1[TM] V3.2 system.

 Documents and objects of any type may be placed in the Office Server
 File Cabinet for immediate access from the Internet, thereby elimi-
 nating the need to produce documents in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML),
 saving on the cost of HTML authoring tools and the training of staff
 in their use.

 Users can access any drawer in their Office Server File Cabinet, and
 any folder including the Inbox. Documents and messages can be down-
 loaded to the client with automatic conversion of WPS-PLUS[TM] (V4.2
 and later) and WordPerfect[R] (V4.1 and later) to HTML (or text for
 OpenVMS).

                                                           July 1997

 

 The system manager, on a system-wide basis, has the ability to pre-
 vent the downloading of messages classed as Company Confidential, Pri-
 vate or Personal, ensuring that such messages are not inadvertently
 left on a computer outside the domain of the organization. Note that
 after user sign-off, downloaded messages and documents may remain in
 cache memory on the computer, and so could be accessed by subsequent
 users of that computer. (Users may clear this cache using features pro-
 vided in their Web browser).

 Additionally, from the Web browser, users may search across folders
 for documents and messages from a choice of selection criteria, and
 list available drawers on Office Server and ALL-IN-1 systems.

 The Web Interface uses standard Web server functionality, dynamically
 producing HTML page representations of the File Cabinet.
