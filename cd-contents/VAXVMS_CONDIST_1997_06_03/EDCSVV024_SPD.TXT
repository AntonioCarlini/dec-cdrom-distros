          PRODUCT NAME:  EDCS II, Version 2.4A                   SPD 26.39.06

          DESCRIPTION

	  EDCS II (Electronic Data Control System II) is an integration
          tool that provides tracking, access control, change
	  notification, and archiving of data across a network
	  regardless of the application that was used to
	  generate the data. EDCS II manages important information about the
	  documents it is controlling. EDCS II manages nonelectronic
	  data such as design drawings stored on microfilm or hard copy.
	  In addition, it manages the same files electronically. It
	  provides revision tracking of work in progress, work in
	  review, and released documents. EDCS II provides an automatic
	  notification capability that maintains lists of persons
	  affected by changes and informs them of the current status.

          EDCS II is a management tool that enables users to efficiently
          share data. It frees users from concerns over the existence of
          multiple originals, latest revisions, and change
          notification issues. EDCS II uses a Client/Server Architecture
          where the client provides the user interface and connects to
          the server, which performs all data management tasks.

          EDCS II supports several interfaces for integration. For the
	  end-user, EDCS II provides a terminal command line interface.
	  For system integrators, EDCS II provides a full function
	  callable interface providing a mechanism to integrate EDCS II
	  into any application suite.

          EDCS command line and callable interface are supported on the Open-
          VMS VAX Client, OpenVMS Alpha Client and PC clients. The callable in-
          terface on the PC is a DDL library for the development of custom ap-
          plications, e.g., MS[R]-Windows[TM] based applications.

          The Sun[R] and RISC/Ultrix clients are no longer supported on EDCS II
          Version 2.4A.

          EDCS II, Version 2.4A                                 SPD 26.39.06


          File Management

          EDCS II manages the creation, use, modification, and storage
          of files. The user can also track the hierarchical
          relationships these files have to one another. The simplest
          entity EDCS II tracks is called an element. A collection of
          elements is a group. Users can define data relationships to
          represent part assemblies and sub-assemblies of a product or
          other collections of data. EDCS II also allows users to create
          dependencies for the purpose of notification, which are
          file relationships that are not hierarchical.

          When using EDCS II to track files, the user will know who created the
          files, when they were created, what changes have been made, and where
          the file is stored. The user can also track information about their
          files by defining attributes. For example, an attribute might
          indicate the language in the file or the material in the file.

          EDCS II can also manage paper documents or aperture cards by
          storing pointers to offline data. In this way, the user can
          monitor the project development electronically and manage
          hardcopy data.

          Version Control

          Every time an entity is changed in EDCS II, a new generation
          is created. EDCS II keeps copies of each successive
          generation and gives each new entity a generation number.
          Users are able to find out what the latest generation is and
          can view the latest version. EDCS II provides the latest
          version automatically, unless the user specifies otherwise.
          EDCS II records all operations on entities and keeps a
          detailed history of transactions.

          Access Control

          With EDCS II, the user can maintain a double security system.
          Access control is assigned to the entity and specifies whether
          a user can read, make changes on, or delete an entity. When a
          change is being made, EDCS II prevents other users from
          updating the same file; however, the file can still be viewed.

          Privileges are assigned to each account. There are six
          privilege levels associated with user type (these
          privileges are cumulative). The privilege level assigned to
          each user determines whether the user is allowed to view,
          create, change, or delete data.

          Automatic Notification of Changes

          The user can set up automatic notification through the use of mail-
          ing lists. This ensures that project members in different departments
          or locations learn about important changes as soon as they occur.

          Configurable Review Manager

          The Review Manager in EDCS II enables users to review completed work
          and approve or disapprove it. This allows project members to be cer-
          tain that all the appropriate team members have reviewed the data. A
          review leader plans the review and creates the review process by as-
          signing review teams and a review path. Team members review the en-
          tity and register their opinion. The review can be configured as teams
          on serial paths, or levels, or several teams may conduct the review
          in parallel.

          History

          EDCS II tracks information about entities and maintains an
          audit trail on the entities it manages. The user can obtain
          all the information kept in the Oracle Rdb[TM] database and
          sort it in different ways, such as how many entities a user
          has created or how many entities have the same attribute.

          Archive and Retrieve

          EDCS II features a new "FETCH from archive" command that
          allows users to retrieve an entity's associated file without
          having to go through the formal EDCS procedure for bringing an
          ARCHIVED file back online, for example, the EDCS RETRIEVE
          utility. This feature benefits EDCS customers who archive
          data to magnetic disk.

          Query and Database Access

          Powerful and comprehensive SHOW commands allow the user to
          display formatted information on entities and their
          characteristics, as well as access and mailing lists, user
          account information, or the reviews in progress. EDCS II has a
          callable interface for added reporting capabilities used to
          return user-customized information. Information can also be
          accessed directly from the database using SQL or other query
          languages and 4th generation query applications.

          Distributed Architecture

          EDCS II consists of server software and client software. A user may
          issue commands from any node in a particular network that has the EDCS
          II client software installed. The server processes all of the commands
          and communicates back to the users. The information about the files
          (metadata) is managed in the Oracle Rdb database. The electronic files
          are stored in RMS. Non-resident files are tracked by use of pointers.

          Ability to Manage Heterogeneous Data

          EDCS II is an application-independent file manager. The system
          is capable of managing electronically formatted data or
          hardcopy data such as paper documents or fiche cards.

          EDCS II Interfaces

          EDCS II provides a command line terminal interface and a
          programmable callable interface for tailoring for specific
          application enviornments. The callable interface adheres to
          the OpenVMS operating system calling standards. The EDCS
          supported language is C. For the more advanced user, EDCS II
          commands can be executed using DCL.

          EDCS II Clients

          EDCS II provides three client platforms: OpenVMS VAX, OpenVMS Alpha,
          and 486/Pentium PCs. Full EDCS II functionality (with the exception
          of EMU) is available through the command line and callable interfaces
          on these clients.
