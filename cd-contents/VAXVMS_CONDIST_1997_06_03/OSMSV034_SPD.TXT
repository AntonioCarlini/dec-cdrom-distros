        1 DESCRIPTION

              The Digital[TM] Optical Storage Management Software
              (Digital OSMS) for OpenVMS[TM] product provides OpenVMS
              applications and users the functionality necessary to
              access an optical disk library (or jukebox) using the
              conventional device, file, and record access services
              provided by the OpenVMS Operating System. In most cases,
              no changes will be required to existing applications that
              use magnetic disk storage.

              The OpenVMS VAX[TM] and OpenVMS Alpha version of Digital
              OSMS provides local or VMScluster[TM] access to rewritable
              or WORM (Write Once, Read Many) media containing FILES-
              11 on-disk structure by way of the RW5xx series of
              optical libraries. Digital OSMS for OpenVMS Alpha does
              not support any configuration using WORM media containing
              the WORMS-11[R] on-disk structure.

              Pseudo-Device Representation

              Digital OSMS allows the OpenVMS host to view the optical
              library as a virtual set of disk devices. This translates
              to one virtual disk device for each optical disk surface in
              the library. For example, the Digital RW531 optical library
              has two single-headed optical disk drives and 32 optical
              disk cartridge storage slots. Each storage slot holds one
              optical disk cartridge, so the library has the capacity of
              64 optical disk surfaces. The optical library, therefore,
              appears to applications as 64 virtual disk devices, named
              JBA0: through JBA63:. The JB devices are not physical
              devices; they are called pseudo-devices. Excluding those
              functions that are unique to the optical technology, these
              pseudo-devices emulate the operation of a conventional
              OpenVMS magnetic disk.

              Volume Access


                                                                        1

 







              Volumes in an optical library used with Digital OSMS are
              accessed using the same techniques that are used to access
              conventional OpenVMS disks. The standard OpenVMS INITIALIZE
              command is used to prepare each side of an optical disk
              cartridge for use and the standard OpenVMS MOUNT command
              is used to make the volume known to OpenVMS. WORM volumes
              can only be "initialized" once, whereas rewritable volumes,
              like magnetic disks, can be "initialized" multiple times.
              Once a volume has been mounted, Digital OSMS manages the
              use of the physical optical disk drives to allow volumes to
              remain logically mounted regardless of where the volume is
              in the optical library.

              File Access

              Files on volumes under control of Digital OSMS are
              accessed using the same techniques that are used to access
              conventional OpenVMS files. Once a volume has been mounted,
              files may be opened, read, written, and closed using the
              conventional OpenVMS system services and run-time library
              functions. WORM volumes use the WORMS-11 file system.
              Rewritable volumes use the FILES-11 file system.

              Digital OSMS provides essentially transparent access
              using standard OpenVMS commands and I/O statements from
              application programs. Digital OSMS supports all OpenVMS
              commands and their library routine equivalents, such as,
              but not limited to:

              ALLOCATE         DEALLOCATE    MOUNT
              APPEND           DELETE[2]     OPEN
              BACKUP[1]        DIFFERENCE    PURGE
              CLOSE            DIRECTORY     READ
              COPY             DISMOUNT      RENAME
              CREATE           EDIT          WRITE
              CREATE           INITIALIZE[3]
              /DIRECTORY
    
              [1] Not all backup options are supported using WORM media.

              [2] This command can be used with WORM media but will not
                  free up additional disk space as with rewritable media.
    
              [3] This command can be used only once with WORM media.

        2 SYSTEM MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS

              The management utility tool, JBUTIL, lets the system
              manager control the parameters affecting the operation
              of the optical library. The utility also allows cartridges
              to be loaded into and removed from the optical library.
              Once a cartridge has been placed in a storage slot inside
              the optical library, it will remain associated with the
              corresponding JBxx: device destination until the cartridge
              is removed from the optical library using JBUTIL.

              The ODUTIL utility is provided for analyzing and recovering
              lost files on WORM media - for VAX systems only. The ODUTIL
              utility lets the user:

              o  Recover files that have been "lost" on a WORMS-11
                 optical disk; that is, files that still exist on the
                 disk but are not entered into any directory.

              o  Display the number of allocated blocks in all files
                 currently visible (not deleted) on the disk volume.

              o  Analyze and repair the file structure of a WORMS-11
                 optical disk by correcting the pointer that describes
                 the next free block to use on the optical disk.

              o  Recreate corrupted directories and restore the required
                 files into the directory.

              Some of these functions were provided by the ODRECOVER and
              ODANALYZE utilities in previous releases.

        3 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

              The person planning a system configuration must understand
              the hardware requirements of the complete system. Due to
              the variety of processors that support OpenVMS and the
              length of time that some OpenVMS systems have been in
              service, there exist a huge combination of processor, SCSI
              adapter/controller, and optical subsystem combinations.
              Some combinations are not supported. For example, the
              VAX 6000, 7000, 8000, and 10000 series processors are only
              supported when the optical library is connected to an HSD
              or HSJ controller.

              [2] Digital OSMS uses one cache file per optical storage
                  volume. As a result, volume caching options selected at
                  installation can result in disk requirements ranging from
                  4 additional blocks to cache one optical disk volume to
                  15,597,092 additional blocks - the maximum allowable cache
                  for 476 optical disk volumes.

              These counts refer to the disk space required on the system
              disk. Additional disk space can be required based on the
              user's system environment and configuration, as well as the
              user options selected at installation time.

              The minimum memory supported is 16 Mbytes for VAX systems
              and 32 Mbytes for Alpha systems. The use of this software
              in conjunction with increased memory capability improves
              performance. The memory size suggested for most typical VAX
              hardware configurations is at least 32 Mbytes.

              License Management Facility Support

              Digital OSMS for OpenVMS supports the OpenVMS License
              Management Facility.

              License units for Digital OSMS for OpenVMS VAX and Alpha
              are allocated to a single 5.25-inch optical library based
              on the size and slot capacity of the optical library. The
              license is based on unlimited system use.

              Upgrade license units for Digital OSMS for OpenVMS VAX
              and Alpha are used in conjunction with a hardware upgrade
              of the applicable optical libraries and are added to the
              original license to provide a total equal to the combined
              units of the original license plus the upgrade license.

              For more information on the License Management Facility,
              refer to the OpenVMS VAX Operating System Software Product
