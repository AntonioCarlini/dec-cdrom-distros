           PRODUCT NAME: VMS/Hanzi Operation System, Version 5.5  SPD 25.G6.10



           DESCRIPTION

           VMS/Hanzi V5.5 is the simplified Chinese (Hanzi) version of the stan-
           dard VMS V5.5. VMS/Hanzi extends the standard VMS to provide an op-
           erating system environment to support Hanzi and ASCII on VAX and Mi-
           cro/VAX series computers. On top of the basic functions of VMS, VMS
           /Hanzi extends and enhances the system utilities and environment to
           process Hanzi data. Utilities are provided to facilitate the design
           and maintenance of user-defined characters. Output of user-defined 
           characters is supported on DEC Hanzi terminals and printers via 
           On-Demand Loading, a dynamic font loading feature.

           VMS/Hanzi supports simplified Chinese data representation that con-
           forms to the Primary Set of National Standard Code of Chinese Graphic
           Character Set for Information Interchange (GB2312-80) of the People's
           Republic of China. In addition, VMS/Hanzi supports an extension area
           of 8,836 character positions in the form of user-defined characters.

           This SPD describes only the Hanzi specific features of VMS/Hanzi 
           which are extensions or additions to standard VMS. For a description 
           of the base functionality and supported environment of VMS, please 
           refer to the standard VMS V5.5 SPD (SPD 25.01.xx).

           FEATURES

           VMS/Hanzi provides the following Hanzi processing features in addi-
           tion to the base functionality of VMS.
           

           INPUT/OUTPUT

           Input/Output of Hanzi and ASCII characters are supported on Hanzi 
           terminals/printers. The Hanzi terminal driver provides advanced
           line editing support for both Hanzi and ASCII. 

          
           USER-DEFINED CHARACTERS SUPPORT

           VMS/Hanzi provides the following font utilities to facilitate the in-
           put/output of user-defined characters on Hanzi terminals and print-
           ers which support the On-Demand Loading and Preloading of 
           user-defined character fonts. Refer to the System Support Addendum 
           for the supported Hanzi terminals and printers.

           FONTHANDLER - A background process to dynamically perform font load-
           ing of user-defined characters onto supported Hanzi terminals and 
           Hanzi printers with On-Demand Loading mechanism.

           HANZIGEN - A utility to set the characteristics of supported Hanzi
           terminals and Hanzi printers.
