 PRODUCT NAME:  DEComni for OpenVMS VAX, Version 2.1A   SPD 32.32.04
                (Digital's Intelligent Manufacturing and
                Utility Application Programming Inter-
                face)

 DESCRIPTION

 DEComni is a network communication product that provides an Applic-
 ation Programming Interface (API) for connection and management of
 manufacturing/utility control devices and systems. DEComni implem-
 ents the Manufacturing Message Specification (MMS), ISO/IEC 9506-1 
 and ISO/IEC 9506-2. When combined with prerequisite hardware and 
 software, DEComni interoperates with other systems supporting the 
 Manufacturing Message Specification ISO/IEC9506-1 and ISO/IEC 
 9506-2 specifications.

 The DEComni API is also used by DECosap for OpenVMS and provides 
 for both open (OSI/MMS) and proprietary device connections. For 
 more information about DECosap, please see that product's Soft-
 ware Product Description (SPD 32.75.xx).

 Features

 DEComni is an implementation of the Manufacturing Message Specif-
 ication (MMS), ISO/IEC 9506, consisting of a callable interface on
 OpenVMS that takes the proper arguments and transforms them into 
 the proper MMS protocol.

 DEComni provides, as a minimal set, the Client Conformance req-
 uirements for the services specified in MAP Implementation Class 
 MAP3.

 The product may interoperate with those device vendors that have 
 implemented to ISO/IEC 9506 (MMS).

                               DIGITAL                     July 1995

                                                         AE-PBRCG-TE

 

 DEComni provides a high level applications programming interface 
 (API) with a high degree of functionality built in. The interface 
 is easy to use and requires very little support code.

 Components

 Omni API

 Omni API contains a callable run-time library that is an implement-
 ation of MMS. The actual support for services is listed in the Pro-
 tocol Implementation Conformance Statement (PICS) found in Appen-
 dix A: Conformance to Standards. Service classes supported are in 
 the following categories: Environment, VMD Support, Domains, Prog-
 ram Invocations, and Variables.

 Object Definition Facility (ODF)

 ODF is used to define the objects and attribute values that are ex-
 pected to be found at a remote Virtual Manufacturing Device (VMD). 
 This facility is also used to define aspects of a local VMD if sup-
 ported by the application.

 ODF is used to define the mapping of MMS variable types to and from
 OpenVMS data type definitions.

 OmniView

 OmniView is a demonstration application written using the callable 
 interface that operates in a DECwindows Motif[R] environment. It 
 provides a limited user interface to the following MMS client serv-
 ices from a VAXstation running the prerequisite software:

 o  Initiate

 o  Conclude

 o  Status

 o  Abort

 o  GetNameList

 o  Identify

                                  2

 

 o  GetCapabilityList

 o  Read

 o  Write

 o  Start

 o  Stop

 o  Reset

 o  GetVariableAccessAttributes

 o  GetDomainAttributes

 o  GetProgramInvocationAttributes























                                  3

 

 DEComni Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)

 The DEComni IVP performs a series of tests to verify proper instal-
 lation.

 CONFORMANCE TO STANDARDS

 The conformance of DEComni software to OSI standards is specified 
 in Appendix A of this SPD.

 INSTALLATION

 Only experienced customers should install DEComni for OpenVMS soft-
 ware. Digital recommends that all other customers purchase Digi-
 tal's Installation Services. These services provide for install-
 ation of the software product by an experienced Digital Software 
 Specialist. Installation for DEComni consists of the following:

 o  Verification that all components of DEComni have been received

 o  Verification that the necessary versions of the prerequisite 
    software and documentation are available

 o  Verification of the appropriate system parameters

 o  Verification that the system meets the minimum hardware and 
    software requirements as specified this SPD

 o  Customer making available for a reasonable period of time, as 
    mutually agreed upon by Digital and the customer, all hardware 
    communication facilities and terminals that are to be used dur-
    ing installation

 o  Installation of the DEComni software by creating the necessary 
    directories and by copying the software from the distribution 
    media

 o  Verification that DEComni has been installed correctly by using 
    the IVP

 Note: Should a customer attempt the installation and require the 
 services of a software specialist to modify the previously instal-
 led operating system parameters, or aid in the installation, a 
 time and materials charge will apply.

                                  4

 

 Connectivity to all other nodes within the network is the resp-
 onsibility of the customer.

 Note 1

 VAX F floating point is supported. The range is 1.17545*10**-38 
 through 1.17545*10**38. An exponent width of 8 bits is supported. 
 A format width of 32 bits is supported.

 Note 2

 The effective length for strings is limited by the maximum PDU 
 size. See Note 8.

 Note 3

 Date and Time are supported. Support for Time Sequence Ident-
 ifier is N/A.

 Note 4

                                 19

 

 ReadrandeWrite indications are delivered to user written code and 
 thus uninterruptible access is application dependent.

 Note 5

 The syntax and semantics for file name are specified by the Open-
 VMS operating system. This is documented in the VMS documentation 
 under "Full File Specification." Wildcard specifiers are not perm-
 itted.

 The file name must be specified in the first graphic string of the 
 Filename production. Any information in additional graphic strings 
 will be ignored.

 Note 6

 The range is 1-infinity. Acceptance of indications is under prog-
 ramming control. The actual number of outstanding requests 
 allowable is dependent upon process memory limits which is set by 
 either the programmer or system manager.

 Note 7

 This implementation does not specify additional code nor addit-
 ional detail in error type.

 Note 8

 The following semantics are defined for the use of the local 
 detail calling/called fields. As a result, a limit is set for a 
 maximum MMS PDU size, which limits specific functions.

 The semantics of this field are contained in the implementation 
 agreements of the NIST (National Institute for Standards and 
 Technology - OSE Implementor's Workshop) Special Publication 
 500-214 titled Stable Implementation Agreements for Open Systems 
 Interconnection Protocols, Version 7, Edition 1, December 1993, 
 Part 20 (MMS) Sections 8.2.0.3 and 8.2.0.4.

 Note 9

 The optional parameter of Event Actions on an Event Enrollment is 
 not supported.
