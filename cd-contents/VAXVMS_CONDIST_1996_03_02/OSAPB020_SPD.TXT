PRODUCT NAME:  DECosap for OpenVMS VAX, Version 2.0B   SPD 32.75.03
               (Digital's Omni Services for SINEC[R]-
               AP)

DESCRIPTION

DECosap for OpenVMS VAX Version 2.0B is a network communication prod-
uct. It provides a solution to connect Digital OpenVMS applications
with Shop Floor devices based on Siemens SINEC[R] Application Proto-
col and SINEC H1 communication protocols. SINEC H1 services are also
identified as PG communication services within Siemens literature. Al-
though mainly oriented to the manufacturing environment, SINEC H1 and
SINEC AP address generic applications and are intended to provide a
common communication method between different Siemens automation de-
vices - Programmable Logic Controllers, Numeric Control Machines, Robots,
Personal and Minicomputers.

Siemens SINEC H1 has been recommended for connecting PLCs and host com-
puters on large configurations. It has been specified on top of the
ISO/OSI Transport Layer and it is based on Ethernet to improve effec-
tiveness and efficiency: effectiveness through higher performance; and
efficiency through lower costs per connection.

Siemens SINEC AP is layered on top of SINEC H1 and it provides pro-
prietary Session, Presentation and Application layers. The result of-
fers an integrated Siemens Level 1 solution with an associated value
of a consistent and uniform view to the Plant Floor applications.

DECosap for OpenVMS VAXVersion 2.0B fully supports both communication
protocols - SINEC H1 and SINEC AP - as detailed in Appendix A.

DECosap for OpenVMS VAXVersion 2.0B provides the support for both SINEC
H1 and SINEC AP Application,Presentation and Session layers. As both
communication protocols are defined on top of the ISO OSI Transport
Layer, DECosap for OpenVMS VAX Version 2.0B relies upon DECnet/OSI to
complete the communication stack. For more information, refer to the
DECnet/OSI Software Product Description (SPD 29.03.xx).

Because of the functional compatibility between Siemens SINEC AP and
MMS - Manufacturing Messaging Services - ISO International Standard
9506 - Part 1 and 2, DECosap for OpenVMS VAXVersion 2.0B is integrated
within the software architecture of the DEComni product to supply the
Application Programming Interface (API). For more information, refer
to the DEComni for OpenVMS Software Product Description (SPD 32.32.xx).

Installation

Only experienced customers should attempt installation of this prod-
uct. Digital Equipment Corporation recommends that all other customers
purchase Digital's Installation Services. These services provide the
installation of the software by an experienced Digital Software Spe-
cialist. The installation of DECosap for OpenVMS VAX Version 2.0B con-
sists of the following:

o  Verification that all components of product have been received.

o  Verification that the necessary versions of the prerequisite soft-
   ware and documentation are available.

o  Verification of the appropriate system parameters. [NOTE: Should
   a software specialist be required to modify the previously installed
   operating system parameters, a prevailing rate time and materials
   charge will apply].

o  Verification that the system meets the minimum hardware and soft-
   ware requirements.

o  Provision for a reasonable period of time, as mutually agreed upon
   by Digital and the customer, all hardware communication facilities
   and terminals that are to be used during installation.

o  Installation of the software by creating the necessary directories
   and copying the software from the distribution media.

o  Verification of the proper installation of the product by running
   the IVP.

Connectivity to all other nodes within the network is the responsi-
bility of the customer. Delays caused by any failure to meet these re-
sponsibilities will be charged at the prevailing rate for time and ma-
terials.

       APPENDIX B - SINEC H1 Functionality Cross Reference Tables

     The following tables list the Conformance Building Block
     (CBB) services and parameters that are supported by DECosap
     for OpenVMS VAX V2.0B. They are compared to the services
     provided within the first version. The level of support de-
     pends upon the level of functionality provided by the target
     Siemens communication processors.
