     PRODUCT NAME:  VAX DECgraph, Version 1.6            SPD 26.07.11

     DESCRIPTION

     VAX DECgraph is a general purpose graphics plotting package that
     runs under the VMS Operating System. VAX DECgraph allows users
     to create, change, display, and print graphs. Individuals can
     use VAX DECgraph for decision support and making presentations.

     User Interface Features

     o  An interactive keyboard interface to create, change, and
        display charts.

     o  Menu and submenus use symbols to display user options. Arrow
        keys are used to move to the different options. Once posi-
        tioned on the desired option, the ACCEPT or RETURN key is
        used to select it. A message area at the bottom of the screen
        displays user information.

     o  A sample set of data files is supplied with the installation
        kit.

     o  Color palettes can be used to select colors for the chart.

     o  On-line help facilities and task-oriented documentation.

     o  Ability to display an output file on any supported terminal
        device (refer to the HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS section) without
        running VAX DECgraph.

     o  Completed charts can be output from both interactive and non-
        interactive (VMS DCL) modes in either color ReGIS, black and
        white ReGIS, or printer protocol formats.

     o  A VMS printer queue can be set up with a supported graphics
        printer (see Optional Hardware section) to output printer
        protocol files.

     Data Manipulation Features

     o  Application programmers can call VAX DECgraph from any VAX
        higher level language supporting the VMS calling standard.
        Programs can:

        -  Turn control over to VAX DECgraph for use with the key-
           board

        -  Create and display charts without using the keyboard
           interface

        -  Include VAX DECgraph as part of a larger software system

     VAX DECgraph can be used with VAX DATATRIEVE to manipulate data,
     then load and plot the values from the current collection.

     Multiple data files can use the same graph description file to
     create a series of charts with similar format. A single data
     file can be plotted in different formats with multiple graph
     description files.

     Data is supplied to VAX DECgraph in one of the following ways:

     o  With the forms oriented keyboard interface that allows the
        user to input titles, labels, legends, multipliers, data
        types and values in the appropriate locations on the screen.
        Changes and updates are also made via the keyboard interface.

     o  With properly formatted ASCII data files (described in the
        documentation) that can be used to create valid data files
        from sources such as VAX languages or a text editor. These
        files can then be loaded into VAX DECgraph through the key-
        board interface.

     o  With VAX DATATRIEVE by establishing the current collection,
        loading the records of the collection into VAX DECgraph by
        typing in the desired field names (using the keyboard inter-
        face), and plotting the selected information. VAX DATATRIEVE
        can be used to access VAX DBMS records as well as those in
        DATATRIEVE domains.

     Graphics Features

     In defining graphs, users can specify:

     o  Plot type

        -  Bar (cluster, stack or histogram; with or without drop
           shadows)

        -  Line (simple or filled)

        -  Pie (whole or with an isolated section)

        -  Scatter (with or without trend line)

        -  Grid type (vertical, horizontal, full or none)

        -  Scaling (linear, logarithmic)

        -  Range of values

        -  Legends (automatic or no legend)

        -  Color, background patterns, line types, and markers

     o  Charts are printed with an outside border

     Special function keys include:

     o  Call on-line help

     o  Display the current chart

     o  Print the current chart

     o  Reset VAX DECgraph and return the user to the main menu
