PRODUCT NAME:  DECnet/OSI Version 7.0 for OpenVMS VAX  SPD 25.03.39

DESCRIPTION

DECnet/OSI Version 7.0 for OpenVMS VAX is an implementation of Phase
V of the Digital Network Architecture (DNA) for the OpenVMS operating
system for VAX hardware. DECnet/OSI integrates DECnet and Open Systems
Interconnection (OSI) network protocols, allowing both stacks to
share integrated network functions up to the Transport layer. Upper
layers have been implemented as separate "towers," allowing existing
DECnet and OSI applications to share the integrated Transport layer.
Existing DECnet Phase IV and new DECnet and OSI applications are 
supported by DECnet/OSI. In combination with TCP/IP protocol stacks, 
OpenVMS systems can participate in multivendor, multiprotocol networks
adhering to open networking standards.

DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS features include:

o  Continued support for 32-bit network applications.

o  X.25 network management interface, providing more efficient wide
   area network (WAN) management.

o  The ability to configure all members of a cluster from any 
   cluster member.

o  The ability to generate an OpenVMS audit event when a connection
   is established.

o  OSI application programming interfaces, formerly offered as a 
   separate product.

o  A new OSI Session layer programming interface (SPI).

                                                       January 1996

                                                        AE-NJ32Q-TE

 

o  The ability to run DECnet and OSI applications over TCP/IP 
   transports.

o  Expanded naming options, allowing the use of a new and larger 
   local namespace, DECdns, and/or DNS/BIND as naming services.

o  The Graphical Network Management user interface for improved 
   network management.

o  Routing segregated mode to allow the Routing layer to choose a Phase
   IV router for those packets having a Phase IV compatible address.
   (Packets having a Phase V extended address are sent to a Phase V
   router by default.) This is a configurable option.

o  Reverse path caching to capture path information for later use in
   reaching remote systems.

o  Increased network size, supported through the use of ISO OSI 
   addressing.

o  Simplified installation and configuration process.

o  The Network Control Language (NCL). Network management is based on
   DNA CMIP, Digital's implementation of the OSI international 
   standard Common Management Information Protocol.

o  An NCP emulator to facilitate installation of layered products
   written for DECnet Phase IV.

o  Installation using the POLYCENTER Software Installation utility.

o  Network naming, allowing the use of either local naming or fully
   distributed name services.

o  Support for topologies using multicircuit and multihomed end nodes.

o  Dynamic connections over X.25 networks.

o  OSI implementation in accordance with current U.S. and U.K. GOSIP

         and FDDI LANs, and DDCMP for backwards compatibility. HDLC
         support includes the LAPB protocol for X.25 communications.

      .  Physical layer, with CSMA/CD, HDLC, and FDDI devices supported.

DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS is available in two forms: End System and 
Extended Function. Extended Function provides all the features of End
System plus the OSI application gateways (FTAM - DAP gateway, VT-Telnet,
VT-LAT), the DECdns Server, the OSI application programming interfaces
and cluster alias. See the Software Licensing section for more details.

DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS offers task-to-task communications, file 
management, downline system and task loading, network command terminals,
and network resource sharing capabilities using DNA, ISO and TCP/IP
protocols. DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS communicates with adjacent and non-
adjacent DECnet Phase IV, PATHWORKS, DECnet/OSI implementations on other
OpenVMS, ULTRIX, and Digital UNIX systems, as well as OpenVMS systems
running TCP/IP transports.

OpenVMS programs written in native mode programming languages can use
DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS capabilities.

                                 3

 

Depending on the system configuration, networks combining DECnet/OSI
for OpenVMS systems with other DECnet, OSI and TCP/IP products may limit
the functions available if all products do not support equal features.

Data Link Layer

DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS uses asynchronous, Ethernet, and FDDI commu-
nications controllers to interface with other network nodes.

LAN connectivity is provided by the CSMA/CD and FDDI controllers and
drivers supporting ISO 8802-2 Logical Link Control (LLC) type 1 
connectionless service and ISO 8802-3 LLC Type 2. DECnet/OSI also 
supports Ethernet V2 packets on CSMA/CD devices.

Use of FDDI packets larger than 1500 bytes requires a Phase V router
on the FDDI LAN. As with cluster alias support, you may configure the
Phase V router to run the Phase IV distance vector routing protocol
or the Phase V link state routing protocol.

WAN connectivity is provided by optional X.25 software supporting host-
based synchronous communications interfaces.

Supported synchronous devices allow for the use of DDCMP, DEC-HDLC,
LAPB/E and SDLC protocols. BISYNC and GENBYTE protocols are also 
supported on some options. WAN device drivers are required by X.25 to 
establish host-based wide area connections.

Synchronous controllers use DDCMP or HDLC, either when directly 
connected or when connected via modems, to provide full- or half-duplex
communications over point-to-point lines. Synchronous DDCMP multipoint
tributary connections are also supported. Asynchronous controllers use
DDCMP, either when directly connected or when connected via modems,
to provide only full duplex communications over point-to-point lines.
Error correcting and data suppression modems are not supported.

Asynchronous lines are supported only to other
systems running DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS VAX,
DECnet-VAX, DECnet-RSX, and DECnet-DOS.


                                 4

 

DDCMP operation is not supported in cases where an asynchronous 
physical communications line is emulated by lower-level protocols or
communications subsystems. Examples of this include X.29 virtual 
terminals, asynchronous connections as emulated by terminal servers, and
connections via data switches.

DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS allows up to four circuits to be defined and
operational on an end system. This capability allows a single end 
system to be connected to up to four separate LANs or WANs. Digital 
recommends that the circuits be equal in capacity and connectivity.

X.25

The DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS VAX license includes the right to use X.25
Access software, formerly known as VAX P.S.I. Access. The right to use
X.25 Native mode software, formerly known as VAX P.S.I., requires an
additional license. See the Optional Software section of this SPD for
ordering information. The X.25 software in DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS is
backwards compatible with systems running the older VAX P.S.I. 
products. Applications written to the older P.S.I. interfaces will 
continue to run, unchanged, with the X.25 software supported on DECnet/OSI.

The X.25 native software allows suitably configured DECnet/OSI 
systems to connect to Packet Switching Data Networks (PSDNs) conforming
to CCITT recommendation X.25 (1980 or 1984) and/or to International
Standards (ISO) 7776 and 8208. This allows a DECnet/OSI system to
function as data terminal equipment (DTE) or be addressed as data circuit
terminating equipment (DCE) as follows:

o  A packet mode DTE connected to a supported PSDN (supported PSDNs
   are listed in Table 4) conforming to CCITT Recommendation X.25 (1980,
   1984)

o  A packet-mode DTE connected to a CSMA/CD LAN conforming to ISO 8802-3
   using ISO Logical Link Control Type 2 (LLC2) as specified in ISO 8881




                                 5

 

o  A packet-mode DTE/DCE connected to a DCE/DTE conforming to ISO 7776
   and 8208

X.25 can be configured for native operation to support direct connec-
tions from a VAX system to one or more PSDNs, each of which may have
one or more DTEs. It also allows communication with any non-Digital
X.25 system on the same LAN that supports the ISO Logical Link 
Control Type 2 (LLC2) protocol.

X.25 Access Software

The X.25 access software uses a connector node to provide the phys-
ical connection to a PSDN. A connector node can be an X25router 100
/2000 (SPD 28.86.xx), a DEC X25gateway 100/500 (SPD 32.97.xx), 
DECnis router (SPD 36.95.xx), among others.

DECnet/OSI logical links are established by OpenVMS to connect the X.25
Access system to the X.25 Connector system. These links may use any
supported DECnet/OSI communications path between the X.25 Access 
system and the Connector system, provided they themselves do not use an
X.25 connection. X.25 Access uses these links to transmit X.25 or X.29
messages between the Connector system and the X.25 Access system.

Note that successful use of an X.29 connection, either for incoming
X.29 calls or by means of the host-based PAD utility supplied with X.25
Access, depends on the DECnet/OSI circuit between the Access and 
Connector system having a low response time. This requires high-speed 
DECnet/OSI connections and few intermediate routing systems.

A single X.25 Access system can connect to one or more Connector 
systems concurrently, and hence access all PSDN(s) accessible from those
Connector systems. When X.25 Access is used, one of these Connector
systems/PSDN combinations must be established as the default gateway
for outbound and inbound traffic.

Features

The X.25 software provides the Connection-Oriented Network Service (CONS)
to allow mapping between a destination NSAP address and a destination
DTE address according to ISO 8348.

                                 6

 

The X.25 software can be used in the following ways:

o  Process-to-process (X.25) communications

o  Process-to-terminal (X.29) communications

o  Terminal-to-process (X.29) communications

Process-to-Process (X.25) Communications

The X.25 software provides access for OpenVMS user programs written
in VAX MACRO and high-level languages such as VAX FORTRAN. The X.25
software does not support programs executing in PDP-11 compatibility
mode.

The X.25 programming interface allows application programs to access
the service interface to the packet level by means of the standard
OpenVMS QIO interface. Functions include setting up and breaking network
connections, data transmission and reception, sending and receiving
interrupt messages, and resetting virtual circuits. The interface 
allows splitting and recombining of messages that are longer than the
packet size selected for the circuit.

The X.25 programming interface enables an application program using
OpenVMS system services to communicate with complementary software on
other systems (Digital or non-Digital DTEs) accessible through the X.25
connection.

Process-to-Terminal and Terminal-to-Process (X.29) Communications

The X.25 software supports terminal communications according to CCITT
recommendations X.3, X.28, and X.29 for outgoing and incoming terminal
traffic

X.25 native users may make outgoing calls to other Digital or non-Digital
CPUs, or suitable network PADs accessible through a PSDN, using the
X.29 programming interface or by using the host-based packet 
assembly/disassembly (PAD). The PAD facility accepts DCL-style commands
or CCITT X.28 commands.

                                 7

 

The X.29 interactive terminal interface allows remote asynchronous 
terminals (character-mode DTEs) connected to the network to communicate
with the X.25 host in a manner similar to local terminals. Dissimi-
larities may appear as a result of delays caused by the PSDN(s) and
the various PAD parameter settings chosen by the user or peculiar to
the PSDN(s). In this case, the remote PAD must perform code conver-
sions between ASCII and the code the terminal uses. Note that there
may be some restrictions imposed by the PSDN(s).

Terminal parameters defined in the X.3 recommendation are supported
explicitly. Network-specific enhancements or extensions to the X.3 
parameters are available at both the X.29 programming interface and the
host-based PAD user interface. Terminal processes that depend on these
extensions may cause problems when used on other PSDNs or when accessing
one PSDN via another (for example, international access).

The X.29 terminal interface is compatible with the local terminal 
interface, except for those facilities where the PSDN does not provide
adequate support. The X.29 interface includes support for specific X.29
signaling.

The host-based PAD employs a DCL-style command syntax, offering the
ability to reference the CCITT PAD parameters symbolically, as well
as an interface that conforms to the standard CCITT command signals.
The host-based PAD also offers the capability of running multiple X.29
sessions using the OpenVMS SPAWN and ATTACH commands. The host-based
PAD supports reception of reselection messages to allow X.29 calls to
be redirected to another DTE.

The X.29 programming interface is similar to the X.25 one and allows
an OpenVMS process to control the virtual circuit (for example, to 
modify PAD parameters or clear a call). The X.29 programming interface
can also be used to make an outgoing call to a remote PAD. The 
programming interface allows generation of PAD reselection messages.

The maximum number of terminals supported (both local and remote X.29)
must not exceed the number supported by OpenVMS. The use of PVCs for
X.29 connections is not defined by the 1980, 1984 and 1988 CCITT 
Recommendations and is not supported.

                                 8

 

Static X.25 Circuits

X.25 allows the use of DECnet/OSI facilities over static X.25 circuits.
These circuits are called statically assigned circuits.

Virtual Circuits

X.25 native software supports both permanent virtual circuits (PVCs)
and switched virtual circuits (SVCs). One virtual circuit is used for
each:

o  Incoming or outgoing X.29 terminal connection

o  X.25 connection, using either a SVC or PVC

X.25 native supports a maximum of 4,096 virtual circuits per system.

X.25 Access supports a maximum of 900 virtual circuits per system.

Note that each virtual circuit requires a certain amount of memory so
the number of logical virtual circuits possible on any single system
is limited by the available memory.

Configuration

The X.25 software includes a configuration procedure to configure a
VAX system. This menu-based interface allows network managers to 
create an initialization script to configure entities and their attributes
after initial installation.

X.25 Accounting

The X.25 Accounting utility enables the system manager to obtain 
information PSDN usage. X.25 Accounting can extract the information
collected and display the information directly on a terminal or write the
information to a file. It can also extract information for selected
records, or produce a summary. The X.25 Accounting utility is compatible
with the OpenVMS Accounting utility.

In the case of incoming X.29 calls, no information about the process
/account on to which a user is logged can be stored. However this 
information may be obtained by correlation with OpenVMS accounting records.

                                 9

 

X.25 Security

X.25 security allows control of both remote DTE access to the X.25 
software, and access to the PSDN(s) by OpenVMS processes. X.25 security
allows for access control on the basis of:

o  The remote DTE numbers involved, either on the basis of individual
   DTE numbers or groups of DTE numbers with common leading digits.

o  The process making the outgoing call or the application handling
   the incoming call.

X.25 Mail

The X.25 Mail utility allows communications via electronic mail 
between two OpenVMS systems running the X.25 software in native or in
access mode. Refer to the OpenVMS Operating System SPD 25.01.xx for
more information about OpenVMS Mail.

Synchronous Communications Devices

The X.25 native software supports the synchronous communications
devices listed in Table 2. The devices are different in many respects,
particularly in the amount of CPU used. For optimum performance,
Digital recommends the use of a DMA device.

Line Interfaces

The electrical line interface used for PSDN communications depends on
the hardware device used. X.25 native provides only the electrical 
interface of a DTE rather than a DCE, and does not provide clock 
signals. Therefore, an external clock source (for example, a modem) is
required.

The range of supported synchronous communications devices covers V.24,
V.35 and V.10, RS232, RS422 and RS423 interfaces over point-to-point,
4-wire, synchronous, full-duplex lines at transmission rates up to 256K
bits per second.


                                10

 
Prerequisite Support

For new PSDNs, the customer and Digital must jointly prepare a 
Network Profile and Customer Support Plan covering all the intended 
network systems, their usage of SVCs, PVCs, and other network facilities,
and their support. Without this Network Profile and Customer Support
Plan, Digital cannot support the network connections.

Optional Facility Support

Support for any given CCITT X.25 facility depends on support for it
in the appropriate supported PSDN. Generally, the X.25 software is 
designed to disallow use of facilities that the PSDN will not support.
Table 1 shows what X.25 is capable doing, rather than what it will do
when used on any particular PSDN. The product documentation describes
specific facility availability for the supported public PSDNs.

Wide Area Network (WAN) Device Drivers

The WAN device drivers included in DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS VAX support
synchronous communications. The device drivers all offer a supported
user ($QIO) interface.

The device drivers all support full-duplex and half-duplex operation,
where appropriate to the protocol. DDCMP and SDLC device drivers all
support both point-to-point and multipoint tributary operation. `BISYNC'
refers to the IBM[R] implementation of bisynchronous protocol. The 
GENBYTE protocol is a general byte-oriented protocol for use with 
user-written framing routines on some of the device drivers.

The maximum permitted line speed depends on the line interface s
standard used and must not exceed 19.2 Kb/s for an RS232 /V.24 standard
interface. There may be additional line speed restrictions for other
line interface standards. Refer to the Software Product Descriptions
for the synchronous interfaces for more information. The Digital
communications layered products may not necessarily support operation of
the synchronous interface at the maximum speed supported by the 
device driver. Refer to the appropriate Software Product Description for
the Digital communications layered product for precise details of 
supported configurations.

In all cases, the data throughput over the synchronous lines is 
dependent on the user applications and system environment.

The device drivers all support modem control signal operation. Refer
to the product descriptions for the appropriate synchronous interface
for details of the modem signals supported by an individual device.

Supported controllers are listed in Table 2.

WAN device drivers include a pseudodriver (WANDRIVER) that provides
a programming interface to the Data Link level for the LAPB, DEC-HDLC,
and DDCMP protocols.

Network Layer

DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS supports both the Connectionless-Mode Network
Service (CLNS) and the Connection-Oriented Network Service (CONS). 
DECnet/OSI supports end-system routing only.

Exchange of routing information between end systems and routers uses
the ISO 9542 ES-IS routing protocol. This allows DECnet/OSI systems
to autoconfigure as end systems with ISO 9542-conformant routers.

Addresses conform to the ISO 8348 Addendum 2 specification, allowing
the support of large network topologies. As long as the system address
stays within the addressing range of Phase IV systems (up to 1,023 
systems per area and up to 63 areas per network), and uses the same 
initial domain part (IDP), Phase IV or Phase V routers may be used.

The Network layer supports the capability of an end system to be 
multicircuited and multihomed. Multicircuit support allows multiple 
circuits to be active simultaneously. This increases network reliability
and data throughput. Multihomed end-system support allows a system
to have up to three network entity titles.

Segregated routing mode is a settable attribute. It directs routing
to choose a Phase IV router for those packets having a destination 
address that can be translated to the Phase IV format. All other 
packets will be sent to a Phase V router, if available.

The Routing layer is able to cache information about the paths that
are used to reach remote nodes.

Transport Layer

DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS provides support for:

o  OSI Transport protocol as specified in ISO 8073

o  RFC 1006 and 1006 Extensions (Internet Draft) to allow DECnet and
   OSI applications to run over TCP/IP


                                16

 

o  Network Services Protocol (NSP)

NSP, RFC 1006 and OSI transports support communications between 
DECnet, TCP/IP and OSI systems. NSP provides backwards compatibility with
Phase IV DECnet systems.

RFC 1006 Extensions support for DECnet applications is provided via
a kernel interface that has been implemented on all TCP/IP stacks 
available for use on the OpenVMS operating system. The supported applica-
tions include all licensed DECnet applications as well as layered 
products, and user-written applications that conform to the documented
DECnet programming interfaces.

The IETF RFC 1006 is a specification for running OSI applications over
TCP/IP. Operation of the FTAM and Virtual Terminal applications over
a TCP/IP network is supported along with other layered OSI applications
such as X.400 and X.500.

A separate TCP/IP stack is required on the same system with DECnet/OSI.
See the Optional Software section of this SPD for information on 
supported TCP/IP products.

OSI Transport supports Transport Classes 0, 2, and 4 on connection-
oriented networks and Class 4 on connectionless networks.

OSI Transport uses two types of network service:

o  The Connectionless-Mode Network Service (CLNS) using the Internet
   protocol (ISO 8473) and ES-IS protocol (ISO 9542) to communicate
   across linked subnetworks. The inactive subset of ISO 8473 (null
   internet) is also supported for communications over a single ISO
   8802-3 local area network.

o  The Connection-Oriented Network Service (CONS).






                                17

 

Upper Layers

DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS software provides the OSI upper layer stack 
consisting of Session, Presentation and Application layers. The Appli-
cation layer provides Association Control Service Element (ACSE); File
Transfer, Management, and Access (FTAM); and Virtual Terminal (VT).

DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS also provides a range of DECnet applications
and services including file and record access, remote terminal access,
mail, and phone.

Applications

Transport Options for Applications

Applications written to the DECnet upper layers can now be run over
NSP, OSI or TCP/IP transports via RFC 1006. This includes the network
applications that are licensed with DECnet/OSI as well as user-written
applications that adhere to the documented DECnet programming 
interfaces. The use of TCP/IP transports via RFC 1006 does not require 
any modification to the existing application.

Applications written to the OSI upper layers can now be run over OSI
or TCP/IP transports.

Remote File Transfer

DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS supports two upper layer protocols for remote
file transfer: the OSI Protocol File Transfer, Access and Management
(FTAM) and the DECnet Data Access Protocol (DAP). FTAM

FTAM supports file transfer, access, and management between a DECnet/OSI
for OpenVMS system and other systems with software adhering to ISO 8571.
In addition, FTAM is conformant with NIST Phase II and Phase III 
agreements and is certified as being conformant to the released 
specifications of U.S. GOSIP, U.K. GOSIP and ENV41204.

In addition, FTAM:

o  Provides users the ability to create, delete, rename, view, and copy
   files using DCL commands.

                                18

 

o  Is implemented as an Application Service Element (ASE) of the OSI
   Application layer.

o  Acts as the initiator or as the responder in a connection.

o  Accesses and transfers files with both binary and character data.
   FTAM-1, FTAM-2, FTAM-3, and NBS-9 document types are supported.

DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS also supports gateway services between FTAM and
DAP.

A full description of the FTAM services in DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS is
provided in Appendix A of this document.

DAP

The DECnet Data Access Protocol (DAP) supports task-to-task communi-
cations, file and record access, and proxy access.

Task-to-Task Communications: For most applications, task-to-task 
communications can be programmed in a transparent manner where the
remote task is treated as a full-duplex, record-oriented device. 
Transparent operation is provided with the following interfaces: system 
Service Calls, RMS calls (OPEN, GET, PUT, and CLOSE), and high-level 
language I/O statements (which are mapped to RMS calls). A nontransparent
mode of task-to-task communications is offered by means of the system
service interface that extends the capabilities provided by the
transparent mode. These capabilities include support for interrupt 
messages and multiple inbound connect requests.

Using DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS, an OpenVMS program written in a native
mode programming language can exchange messages with other user programs.

File Access: File access is supported to and from remote DECnet/OSI
for OpenVMS systems, transparent to native mode high-level language
programs using RMS. User programs can sequentially read, create, and
delete files on a remote node.


                                19

 

Record Access: User programs can perform record level operations such
as GET, PUT, UPDATE, DELETE, FIND, and REWIND to access and modify files
residing on a remote OpenVMS node. In addition to sequential access
to a file, several other access methods are supported through RMS 
using DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS. These methods include random access by
relative record number, random access by key value, random access by record
file address (RFA), and block I/O access by virtual block number.

Proxy Access: Remote users can have access to up to 15 proxy accounts
on a specific remote system. One proxy account should be designated
as the default proxy account on the remote system.

Command Language File Management: Most OpenVMS Digital Command 
Language (DCL) commands can be used to perform remote file operations.
These commands include: ANALYZE, APPEND, BACKUP, CLOSE, CONVERT, COPY,
CREATE, DELETE, DIFFERENCES, DIRECTORY, DUMP, OPEN, PRINT, PURGE, READ,
SEARCH, SUBMIT, TYPE, and WRITE. The operation of these commands is
transparent except for commands that invoke processing on a specific
system (for example, SUBMIT/REMOTE and PRINT/REMOTE). Only a node name
added to a file specification is required to invoke the network 
capabilities via one of these commands.

Using the COPY command, a user can transfer sequential, relative, and
indexed-sequential (ISAM) files between DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS nodes
that support compatible file structures and record formats. Users can
transfer sequential or relative files with fixed length, variable length,
or variable length with fixed control field records between two 
DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS systems. Similarly, multikeyed indexed files with
variable or fixed length records are supported.

The SUBMIT/REMOTE command allows command files residing on a remote
node to be submitted for execution at the remote node. The command file
must be in the format expected by the node responsible for execution.
DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS allows OpenVMS command files to be received from
other systems and executed.





                                20

 

The DCL command, EXCHANGE/NETWORK, allows the transfer of files to or
from heterogeneous systems. This command gives users the option to 
transfer file types between MS-DOS[R], ULTRIX, and UNIX systems and 
OpenVMS systems regardless of record semantics. Unlike the COPY command,
which preserves file and record organization during a file transfer,
this command enables the user to modify file and record attributes 
during file transfer.

OSI Application Programming Interfaces

The OSI application programming interfaces enable users to write 
distributed applications that communicate over open networks and use the
OSI services provided by DECnet/OSI.

The interfaces are provided under the Extended Function license and
include:

o  An interface to FTAM (File Transfer, Access, and Management)

o  Interfaces to the ACSE (Association Control Service Element) and
   Presentation layers

o  An interface to ROSE (Remote Operations Service Element)

o  An interface to the OSI Session Layer

The interfaces permit application writers to use the services of the
OSI upper layers in their applications.

The APIs allow for the development of applications on DECnet/OSI 
systems. Source code must be compiled and linked with the APIs. The APIs
are required on the development system and the compile/link system.
The resulting application can be run on any DECnet/OSI system with the
appropriate operating system. The APIs are not required on these 
target systems. See Appendix C for details on the OSI APIs.

Network Virtual Terminal

DECnet/OSI supports two upper layer protocols for terminal access: the
OSI Virtual Terminal protocol and the DECnet Command Terminal protocol.

                                21

 

VT

Virtual Terminal (VT) supports the ISO Virtual Terminal Protocol (ISO
9041). This protocol allows remote logins and access to remote appli-
cations between DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS systems and any remote system,
including multivendor systems, that also run an ISO-compliant Virtual
Terminal implementation.

Virtual Terminal is implemented as an Application Service Element (ASE)
of the OSI Application layer.

Virtual Terminal may act as the terminal/initiator (for a local user)
or as the host/responder (for the remote user).

A full description of Virtual Terminal features is provided in Appendix
B of this SPD. SET HOST

The DCL command SET HOST allows a terminal user on one DECnet/OSI for
OpenVMS node to establish a logical connection to another DECnet/OSI
node that uses the Command Terminal (CTERM) protocol. This connection
makes the terminal appear to be physically connected to the remote 
system and the operator can use all the standard system and network 
utilities supported by that remote node. This capability is particularly
useful for doing remote program development and allows the terminal
users on smaller application-oriented systems to use the resources of
larger development-oriented systems.

Other interfaces are standard parts of DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS. Users
can develop programs and procedures based upon these interfaces for
such functions as file access and task-to-task communications on 
individual systems. Because the DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS interfaces stay
the same, the programs and procedures developed on an individual 
system can be used in a network environment without being modified.







                                22

 

Services

Downline Loading

DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS allows for the loading of an unattended 
system using the services provided by the Maintenance Operations Module
(MOM). MOM provides a set of maintenance operations over various types
of circuits by using the Maintenance Operations Protocol (MOP). A
loadable system is a system that has a load device enabled for MOP 
service functions and for which a properly formatted load file is
supplied. Downline loading involves transferring a copy of the load file
image to a remote target node. Load requests can come from the local
DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS operator or from the target node. Downline 
loading is supported for Digital server products. However, this facility
is not supported over asynchronous DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS VAX connections.

Downline Task Loading

Initial task images for loadable systems can be stored on OpenVMS file
system devices and loaded into remote nodes. Programs already executing
on loadable systems can be checkpointed to the host OpenVMS file
system and later restored to main memory in the node. These features
simplify the operation of network systems that do not have mass 
storage devices.

Downline task loading is not supported over asynchronous DECnet/OSI
for OpenVMS VAX connections.

Upline Dumping

Memory images of adjacent nodes connected by DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS
can be written or dumped into a file on an OpenVMS system. This 
facility provides assistance in troubleshooting in the event of a 
system crash. This facility is also supported for Digital server
products.

This facility is not supported over asynchronous DECnet/OSI for 
OpenVMS VAX connections.


                                23

 
Mail

The OpenVMS Mail utility allows transmission of text messages between
users on systems supporting MAIL-11. The DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS software
allows users to exchange mail with users of other DECnet/OSI systems.

Phone

The OpenVMS Phone utility allows users to send and receive data 
interactively from one user's terminal to another user's terminal.
DECnet/OSI allows users on different systems in the same DECnet/OSI 
network to exchange information.

VMScluster Alias

DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS supports the ability to access nodes in a 
VMScluster using a separate alias node address, while retaining the ability
ity to address each node in the cluster individually. Not all network
objects may be accessed using this mechanism. The maximum number of
nodes supported for a cluster alias is 94. Refer to the VMScluster 
Software Product Description (SPD 29.78.xx) for relevant restrictions.

DECnet/OSI no longer requires a cluster member to be configured as a
router. Clusters in a DECnet/OSI environment require a reachable 
IS-IS compliant router on the LAN.

Network Management

Network management is provided with the Network Control Language (NCL).
Network management implements the DECnet/OSI layered model, based on
the Digital hierarchical structure called Enterprise Management 
Architecture (EMA).

Users can access NCL through either a command line interface or a
graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI allows network managers to
view thestatus of network components and control those components from a 
Motif-based window interface.




                                24

 

The DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS network management software allows system
and network managers to:

o  Control and monitor the operation of a network and provide 
   information related to network traffic and performance

o  Configure network operating parameters

o  Start up and shut down network components as needed

o  Detect and isolate network problems, and return the network to 
   service once repaired.

In addition, network management can provide information, warning 
network managers of faulty or failing network components, both hardware
and software.

Network Command Language (NCL) is provided as a utility to the 
network manager to perform the operations described above.

Network managers can also use NCL to test specific components of the
network. NCL enables transmission and reception of test messages 
either between systems or through controller loopback arrangements. The
messages can then be compared for possible errors. NCL helps users
isolate network problems.

DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS provides network event logging to a terminal
device, disk file, or remote system. NCL users can enable and disable
the event logging facility as well as optionally filter specific events.

NCL uses the DNA Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP) which
permits entity management from a single location anywhere in the 
DECnet/OSI network.

The Common Trace Facility (CTF) allows the network manager to collect
and display information about specific protocol exchanges between 
systems.



                                25

 

DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS supports an ISO CMISE application programming
interface (API) conforming to the Service Definitions in ISO 9595. The
API allows for development of applications that can communicate with
other management applications conforming to ISO 9595 on remote nodes
in the network.

DECnet/OSI supports the DECnet Phase IV NCP for remote management of
Phase IV DECnet systems.

Name Service Options

DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS allows the use of one or more naming services.
The available services are DECdns, DNS/BIND and a new local namespace.
Node name and addressing information is stored in the native name 
service; TCP/IP information is maintained in DNS/BIND and DECnet and OSI
information is maintained in DECdns or the local namespace.

When more than one name service is being used, a configurable search
list defines the order in which the existing services are to be 
accessed.

Local Namespace

The local namespace replaces the Local Name Option (LNO). Using the
local namespace, up to 100,000 nodes can be defined in a local 
naming database. A migration tool is available to move Phase IV and/or
LNO databases to the new large local file format and/or DECdns 
format.

DNS/BIND

DECnet can now retrieve TCP/IP naming and addressing information from
the DNS/BIND name service.

DECdns

DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS provides a global naming service with the 
Digital Distributed Naming Service (DECdns).


                                26

 

The full DECdns service provides a consistent, network-wide set of names
for network resources called the namespace. This namespace is 
maintained by one or more DECdns server systems. Digital recommends that
DECdns servers be installed on at least two systems in every LAN. This
should provide adequate service and redundancy.

The features provided by DECdns include:

o  A networkwide name-to-attribute mapping service which allows 
   selected Digital applications to create, read, modify, and delete names
   in the namespace

o  A hierarchical structure permitting a large number of names to be
   stored and distributed across the network

o  Access control to each name in the namespace

o  Management and event logging

Distributed Time Service

DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS provides a network time service with DECdts,
the Digital Distributed Time Service. DECdts provides precise, fault-
tolerant clock synchronization for systems in a LAN or WAN. Time is
provided in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and may be used across
a global network. Several forms of time provider are supported, and
a callable interface for applications allows users to add their own
time providers. DECdts may be used by distributed applications to 
determine event sequencing, duration, and scheduling.

DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS Operation

DECnet/OSI is implemented under OpenVMS as an Ancillary Control 
Process (ACP) and a network device driver with Digital-supplied executive-
level components and user-level programs.

The normal OpenVMS protection has been incorporated in the operation
of DECnet/OSI. For example, incoming connects, including file access
and file transfer requests, are protected by the normal OpenVMS 
login and file protection mechanisms. Outgoing connects, including file

                                27

 

access and file transfer requests, can include user password infor-
mation that is implicitly specified via NCL, or explicitly specified
by the user for verification on the remote node.

DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS Configuration and Performance

DECnet/OSI can be configured using either the BASIC or ADVANCED 
configuration options. The BASIC option is the default. It uses 
existing system defaults and requires minimal information from the system
manager. The ADVANCED option should be used where specific customization
is required.

With DECnet Version 6.3 and later, cluster nodes are configurable from
any node within the cluster.

As with any network protocol, the performance of a given DECnet/OSI
for OpenVMS node is a function not only of the expected network 
traffic and resultant processing, but also of the amount of concurrent 
processing specific to that node. Thus, node performance depends on many
factors including:

o  CPU type

o  Number and type of devices attached to the particular CPU

o  Number of device interrupts per unit time

o  Communications line(s) characteristics

o  Number and size of buffers

o  Message size and frequency of transmission

o  Applications in use

It is important to note that the rate at which user data can be trans-
mitted (throughput) over a communications line can sometimes approach,
but will never exceed, the actual line speed. This is because the 
actual throughput is a function of many factors, including the line
quality, protocol overhead, topology, and network application(s), as well
as the factors cited in this section.

                                28

 

The performance of DECnet/OSI is comparable to the performance of 
DECnet Phase IV.

   X.25 Mail

New features are extensively documented in the Release Notes.

The documentation for DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS is shipped on the 
OpenVMS layered product CD-ROM. Hard copy of the documentation is
available as a separate order.

INSTALLATION

DECnet/OSI software is customer installable. Installation services are
available for customers who desire installation of the software 
product by an experienced Digital Software Specialist.

Digital requires that a customer's first use of X.25 include Digital
Installation Services. These services provide for installation of the
software product by an experienced Digital Software Specialist.

Customer Responsibilities

Before Digital Services can install the software, the customer must:

o  Ensure that the system meets the minimum hardware and software 
   requirements (as specified in the relevant SPDs)

o  Prior to installing Digital hardware or software, obtain, install,
   and demonstrate as operational any modems and other necessary 
   customer equipment or facilities to which Digital's communications 
   hardware or software will connect

                                30

 

o  Designate one adjacent node to verify installation/connectivity

o  Make available for a reasonable period of time, as mutually agreed
   upon by Digital and the customer, all hardware communications 
   facilities and terminals that are to be used during installation.

Delays caused by any failure to meet these responsibilities will be
charged at the then-prevailing rate for time and materials.

Installation of DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS consists of the following tasks:

o  Verify that all components of DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS have been 
   received.

o  Verify that the necessary versions of the OpenVMS software and 
   documentation are available.

o  Verify the appropriate SYSGEN parameters.
   Note: If a software specialist is required to modify the previously
   installed operating system parameters, a time and materials charge
   will apply.

o  Create any necessary DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS accounts and directories.

o  Enable software by registering the License Product Authorization
   Key (PAK) .

o  Install the DECnet/OSI software on the target system using the 
   POLUCENTER Software Installation (PCSI) utility .

o  Verify the proper installation of DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS by 
   running a series of tests to show connectivity to a designated node.

Connectivity to all other nodes within the network is the responsi-
bility of the customer. Digital recommends the use of NCL to help 
verify connectivity.

In some cases, the PSDN supplier (or PTT) may impose restrictions, 
limitations, or requirements on the proposed Digital network configuration.
The customer must understand and adhere to these controls for each and
every network.

                                31

 

For installation of the X.25 software, the customer must:

o  Demonstrate equivalence of operation for modems other than Bell 208A,
   208B, 209, 212A synchronous modems, or in Europe, PTT approved modems.

o  Subscribe to the Open User Group and to at least two Switched 
   Virtual Circuits (SVCs) to complete the product's installation
   checkout (this tests loops information from the X.25 native system to
   the PSDN and back to X.25 native system). Systems that use Permanent
   Virtual Circuits (PVCs) or Closed User Groups only, or where
   the PSDN does not support calls to the same DTE address, require
   specially negotiated arrangements for Digital installation of the
   product.

Processors Not Supported

MicroVAX I, VAXstation I, VAX-11/725, VAX-11/782, VAXstation 8000

Processor Restrictions

A TK50 tape drive is required for standalone MicroVAX 2000 and VAXs-
tation 2000 systems.

The RL02/R80 configuration of the VAX-11/730 is required.

Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1)

For OpenVMS VAX Systems

Disk space required for installation of base software: 65,000 blocks

Disk space required for installation of all optional software: 101,000
blocks


                                34

 
For WAN Device Drivers

Disk space required for installation: 5,000 blocks (2.5 MB)

The disk space required for use (permanent) depends on the number and
type of drivers installed, but should not exceed the space required
for installation.

For X.25 Software

Disk space required for installation: 8,000 blocks (4 MB)

Disk space required for use (permanent): 10,000 blocks (5 MB)

These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
system environment, configuration, and software options.

Cluster Environment

The WAN device drivers are fully supported when installed on any valid
and licensed VMScluster configuration. A device driver may only be 
accessed from the system, or node, containing the communications device.

On common disks, in order to configure some product-specific attributes
that must remain unique to each system, certain components of the 
product are stored in the system-specific environment (SYS$SPECIFIC: [SYSxxx])
of the VAX computer on which the installation is being performed. The
remaining components of the product, including some or all of the 
executable images, will be installed common to all accessing VAX 
systems.

Though some or all of the product's executable images will exist in
the common system directory (SYS$COMMON:[SYS$LDR]) and be executable
by all VAX computers sharing this directory, it is essential that the
product be installed separately on all VMScluster or Local Area 
VMScluster licensed VAX systems requiring access in order to uniquely
configure the product for each.

The same version of WAN device drivers must be used on all systems in
VMScluster systems accessing a common disk and in Local Area VMScluster
configurations.

Refer to Table 3 for detail of line speeds for supported protocols.

o  The DSH32 (dual sync line) and the DST32 (single sync line) are 
   multifunction devices for busless systems. The communications controllers
   support DMA transfers for bit-oriented protocols and perform 
   character transmission, reception, and framing in microcode.

o  The DSW21 and DSW41 (single line) and the DSW42 (dual line) are high-
   performance synchronous communications controllers for busless MicroVAX
   3100 and VAXstation 4000 systems. The communications controllers
   support DMA transfers for bit- and character-oriented protocols.
   The communications controller performs character transmission, 
   reception, and framing in microcode.

o  The DPV11-DA or the DPV11-S (Q-bus) and DUP11 (UNIBUS) are 
   character interrupt devices for data link handling. CPU cycles are
   required for data link level protocol processing and for each 
   character sent and received.

                                36

 

o  The DSV11 is a dual-line synchronous communications device for all
   Q-bus systems. The DSV11 supports DMA transfers for bit- and character-
   oriented protocols. The communications controller performs 
   character transmission, reception, and framing in microcode.

o  The DSF32 (MI-bus) is a multifunction device for VAXft fault tolerant
   systems. The DSF32 provides a dual-line synchronous capability
   and supports DMA transfers for bit- and character-oriented protocols.
   The communications controller performs character transmission,
   reception, and framing in microcode. The two line can be used
   independently to run different protocols or can be used to provide
   a failover capability between lines in the event of an application
   or system failure.

o  The DMB32 (BI-bus) and the DMF32 (UNIBUS) are multifunction devices
   that include a single DMA line. The communications controllers 
   perform character transmission, reception, and framing in microcode.

o  The DSB32 (BI-bus) is a dual-line synchronous communications 
   device for VAXBI systems. The DSB32 supports DMA transfers for bit-
   and character-oriented protocols. The communications controller
   performs character transmission, reception, and framing in microcode.

Notes:

   VAXstation 3100 systems.

o  The DSB32 is not supported for use on the VAX 7000 or VAX 10000
   systems.

o  The DSB32 is not supported for use on a VAX 6600 with extended
   addressing (>512MB of physical memory) enabled.

o  The DMB32, DMF32, and DSH32 are multifunction devices. Only the 
   device driver for the synchronous ports are included in the DECnet/OSI
   kit.

o  The DMB32 must be revision J or later for applications using 
   GENBYTE, HDLC or SDLC protocols.

                                37

 

o  The DMF32 must be revision J of later for applications using HDLC
   protocol and revision M is required for simultaneous operation of
   the printer port.

o  The DMB32 only supports a synchronous line speed of 19.2 Kb/s if
   any asynchronous lines are in use. The DMB32 is also supported on
   VAX 7000 and VAX 10000 systems configured with extended addressing,
   (32-bit physical addresses).

o  The DMF32 is supported on a VAXBI system fitted with a DWBUA UNIBUS
   adapter for DDCMP and GENBYTE protocol use only.

o  The DSH32 running the DDCMP protocol only supports a single line
   at 9.6 Kb/s on a MicroVAX 2000. Running the BISYNC protocol it only
   supports a single line at 4.8 Kb/s on a MicroVAX 2000.

o  The DSV11, DSW42, and the DSB32 support the use of different 
   protocols on each of the two lines of the device.

o  The DUP11 is supported on a VAXBI system fitted with a DWBUA UNIBUS
   adapter for VAX 8200, VAX 8250, VAX 8300, VAX 8300, VAX 8350, VAX
   8500, VAX 8530, VAX 8550, VAX 8700, and VAX 8800 systems only.

___________________________________________________________________

Note: Where two line speeds are shown, for example 256/64, the higher
speed refers to single line operation of the device while the lower
speed refers to dual line operation of the device.

The WAN device drivers included with DECnet/OSI also provide a pseu-
dodriver (WANDRIVER) that provides a programming interface to the data
link level for the LAPB, DEC-HDLC, and DDCMP protocols.

The device drivers all support full-duplex and half-duplex operation,
where appropriate to the protocol. DDCMP and SDLC device drivers all
support both point-to-point and Multipoint tributary operation. "BISYNC"
refers to the IBM implementation of bisynchronous protocol. The 
GENBYTE protocol is a general byte-oriented protocol for use with user-
written framing routines, is supported by the DMB32 and the DMF32
device drivers.

                                39

 

The maximum permitted line speed depends on the line interface 
standard used and must not exceed 19.2 Kb/s for and RS232/V.24 interface.
There may be additional line speed restrictions for other line 
interface standards, refer to the Software Product Descriptions for the 
synchronous interfaces for more information. Other Digital communications
layered products may not necessarily support operation of the synchronous
interface at the maximum line speed supported by the device driver.
Refer to the appropriate Software Product Description for the 
Digital communications layered product for precise details of supported
configurations.

In all cases, throughput over synchronous lines is dependent on the
user application and system environment.

The WAN device drivers all support modem control signal operation. 
Refer to the Software Product Descriptions for the appropriate synchronous
interface for details of the modem signals supported by an individual
interface.

Optional Hardware

Additional communications device(s) subject to the limitations described
in Table 3 of this SPD are required.

X.25 Software Configuration Guidelines

Table 5 describes the physical hardware configurations supported by
X.25 in terms of CPU type and communication interface. It is assumed
that there are 128 bytes of user data per packet in an X.25 native mode
configuration where data is being sent and received at maximum speeds
in both directions. This table indicates the maximum load for certain
VAX processors supported at the time of publication.

The numbers given in the table are load costs. Load costs indicate the
overhead of full-duplex packet transfer at the indicated speed. The
load units are calculated for an application that does no work with
transmitted/received data, and indicate a maximum packet rate for that
configuration. An idle device incurs negligible load. Systems should
be configured to sustain peak load rates.

Factors to Consider

Other factors to consider when configuring hardware devices for use
with X.25 on a given processor are:

o  Hardware configuration limits, such as power supply, backplane space,
   bus throughput and mapping registers available, and any other 
   restrictions on the number of devices per CPU or per bus must be 
   observed.

o  Actual/average packet size in bytes - Generally, doubling the 
   actual packet size will halve the load units consumed for direct
   memory access (DMA) devices, but increase the load units for character-
   interrupt devices by approximately 30 percent.

o  Table 5 assumes that data is sent and received in each direction
   of a full-duplex line in equal ratio. If the number of X.25 packets
   per second is predominantly one-way, the load units per line
   can be reduced proportionately up to a factor of 50 percent.

                                46

 

The maximum system configuration with a mix of device types is 
computed by adding the load costs (in load units) for each device up to
the limit for a given processor type. Table 6 lists the load units for
devices at various speeds.

Notes:

o  * For more than one character interrupt device, multiply the load
   units by 50 percent to allow for interaction between devices.

o  N/S The use of the device at this speed is not supported by X.25.

Example 1:

A VAX 8500 computer is being used to process X.25 native mode commu-
nications. If the system uses one line of a DSB32 at 192 Kb/s and a
DMB32 at 19.2 Kb/s, the load unit total is 156. Assuming these devices
are fully active, they will consume 156/360 = 43% of the CPU for 
communications processing. It is inadvisable to add more devices to this
CPU, unless it is dedicated to the task of communications processing.

Example 2:

When one line of a DSV11 is fully used on a MicroVAX 3800 at 64 Kb/s,
it consumes 120/390 = 31% of the processor in processing X.25 commu-
nications.

APPENDIX A: FILE TRANSFER, ACCESS, AND MANAGEMENT (FTAM)

FTAM software provides communications for performing file operations
between open systems. These operations are:

o  Copying files between local and remote systems.

o  Appending, deleting, or renaming files on open systems.

o  Displaying information about files on open systems.

An open system is a computer system that implements the standards for
each of the seven layers of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) 
Reference Model for communications as defined by the International 
Organization for Standardization. An FTAM system is any open system 
containing an FTAM implementation that conforms to the FTAM standard and
includes the implementations of the necessary underlying OSI services.



                                52

 

FTAM implements several standards that define the following components
of these layers of the OSI Basic Reference Model: the File Transfer,
Access, and Management (FTAM) service element and the Association 
Control Service Element (ACSE) of the Application layer, the Presentation
layer, and the Session layer.

Supported Standards

FTAM conforms to the following OSI standards:

o  ISO 8571 - File Transfer, Access and Management service and 
   protocol

o  ISO 8650 - ACSE protocol

o  ISO 8823 - Presentation protocol

o  ISO 8327 - Session protocol

The following table provides a comparison of the supported implemen-
tation profiles for different standards bodies and their relationship
to each other.

FTAM Component Software

The component software includes the user facilities (initiators), 
responders, management tools, and problem determination tools.


                                54

 

FTAM User Facilities

Users access the FTAM user facilities with the following OpenVMS 
operating system commands: APPEND, COPY, DIRECTORY, RENAME, and DELETE.
These commands operate on files stored on any FTAM system whose 
implementations are compatible with FTAM. These commands cannot be used
for manipulating files on your local system.

Support for Any File Naming Convention

A file designation is system-specific information that identifies a
file to its storage system. FTAM software lets users specify files 
using the naming conventions of the systems where the files reside. FTAM
supports the OpenVMS operating system RMS format for file specifications
and a comparable style of file-specification format that accommodate
non-RMS file designations.

Support for Several File Types

FTAM software can access and transfer files containing both binary and
ASCII data. FTAM-1, FTAM-2, FTAM-3, and NBS-9 document types are 
supported.

FTAM-1 files are unstructured text files, FTAM-2 files are sequential
text files, and FTAM-3 files are unstructured binary files. The FTAM-1,
FTAM-2, and FTAM-3 document types support the following parameters.

          Fixed                      Presence of parameter
___________________________________________________________________

NBS-9 files are NBS file directories.

Flexible and Transparent Access for Local Files

FTAM software treats local files the same way that the OpenVMS 
operating system file system treats them.

File Transfers

The FTAM COPY command transfers files between compatible FTAM systems
without modifying the source file. The facility can transfer files in
either direction between the local system and a remote FTAM system.
The COPY command can also transfer files between two remote FTAM 
systems for a local FTAM user.

This command also allows you to append one or more files to a single
output file within or between FTAM systems.

FTAM-DAP Gateway

The FTAM-DAP Gateway lets you perform file operations from a non-OSI
system that supports the DAP protocol to an OSI system supporting FTAM.
Remote users of the gateway do not have to establish accounts on the
gateway system to use its capabilities. The gateway does not support
the APPEND functionality.

                                56

 

File Deletion

The FTAM DELETE command can delete one or more files on any combination
of FTAM systems provided that the user has delete access to those
files on the specific FTAM system.

Renaming Requests

The FTAM RENAME command allows you to rename files. The command works
on files stored on remote FTAM systems (remote files). The command 
enables you to change the path name or file name of an existing file.
For remote files, you must specify whatever type of information the
remote FTAM system requires for specifying files.

Directory Requests

The FTAM DIRECTORY command displays the complete set of FTAM file 
attributes. Specific options allow users to vary the display of attributes
that are meaningful in an OpenVMS operating system environment, for
example, date/time of last modification of file name.

FTAM File Error Recovery

FTAM provides file error recovery functionality, both in the COPY 
initiator command and in the FTAM responder. File error recovery is
provided for Class 1, Class 2, and Class 3 type errors as detailed in ISO
8571-4.

Class 1 file error recovery provides only the restart functionality,
while Classes 2 and 3 file error recovery provide both the restart and
recovery functionality as follows:

o  If an internal error is detected in the data transfer regime, Class
   1 recovery restarts the data transfer regime by retransmitting the
   file data beginning at the negotiated checkpoint within the data
   transfer regime.

o  Class 2 error recovery provides for the re-establishment of the 
   select and open regimes, and also allows for the retransmission of
   file data beginning at a negotiated checkpoint within the data 
   transfer regime.

                                57

 

o  Class 3 error recovery provides full recovery by re-establishing
   a lost FTAM association and its select and open regimes. Class 3
   recovery will then restart the data transfer regime by retransmit-
   ting the file data beginning at the negotiated checkpoint within
   the data transfer regime.

All restart and recovery operations and procedures are completely 
transparent to the user.

Management and Problem Determination Tools

FTAM software supplies a number of management tools, including an 
installation verification procedure (IVP), a tracing utility, event
logging, and informational and error messages.

FTAM Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)

The FTAM IVP sets up outbound and inbound application associations.
A connection is made to your local system (as a loopback test). The
FTAM IVP checks that your installation is able to set up and release
presentation and session connections. It tests the FTAM software by
starting a responder and reading the attributes of a file with the 
DIRECTORY command.

FTAM Tracing Utility

The FTAM tracing utility (OSITRACE) is a tool for identifying problems
in protocol exchanges between your local system and any remote FTAM
system. The tracing utility captures protocol exchanges and transcribes
them into easily read text; OSITRACE data is written to SYS$OUTPUT.

The FTAM tracing utility monitors data exchanges for individual 
associations. The tracing utility can trace data originating from the
following components: FTAM (DATA, PROTOCOL, and STRUCTURING), ACSE,
Presentation, and Session.

OSI Address Lookup using X.500

The FTAM software is capable of retrieving network addresses from the
X.500 directory. You may use this functionality in conjunction with
or instead of retrieving addresses from a local repository.

                                58

 

FTAM Event Logging

For event logging, the FTAM responder writes records to OSIF$RESPONDER.LOG.

Requirements for Compatibility with FTAM

FTAM lets an open system perform a specific set of file transfer, access
and management activities with any open system having a compatible FTAM 
implementation.

The Protocol Implementation Conformance Statement (PICS) provides more
information about Digital's FTAM implementation.

APPENDIX B: VIRTUAL TERMINAL

DECnet/OSI Virtual Terminal is Digital Equipment Corporation's imple-
mentation of the ISO Virtual Terminal Basic Class standard, which is
comprised of the service definition (ISO 9040) and the protocol (ISO
9041). The DECnet/OSI Virtual Terminal software adheres to these 
standards, thereby providing interactive access between DECnet/OSI 
systems and other multivendor terminal systems and host systems that also
adhere to the ISO Virtual Terminal Basic Class standard.

Virtual Terminal is implemented as an Application Service Element (ASE)
of the OSI Application layer.

DECnet/OSI Virtual Terminal can run over Transport Layer Classes 0,
2 or 4 over CONS, and TP4 over CLNS. DECnet/OSI Virtual Terminal can
also run over TCP/IP networks using RFC 1006.

Virtual Terminal provides terminal/initiator (for a local user) and
host/responder (for the remote user) capabilities. Terminal/responder
and host/initiator are not supported.

Supported Standards

Virtual Terminal conforms to the following OSI standards:

o  ISO 9041 - Virtual Terminal Protocol - Basic Class

o  ISO 8650 - ACSE protocol

                                59

The implementation of the Session layer supports the following OSI 
standards:

o  ISO 8327-Information Processing Systems-Open Systems Interconnection-
   Basic Connection Oriented Session Protocol Specification

o  ISO 8326-Information Processing Systems-Open Systems Interconnection-
   Basic Connection Oriented Session Service Definition.

The Session layer supports ISO Session version 1 and version 2. 
Session version 1 allows up to 512 octets of user data on a service. 
Session version 2 supports the restrictions imposed by the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology allowing up to 10,240 octets of
data on a service.

The Session API provides the interface to the Connect and Release 
services as follows:

o  Connect

o  Release

o  Abort

o  Redirect

The Redirect service is not a Session service. It allows applications
to redirect an incoming connection to another process on the local 
system.

                                64

 

The Session API also provides the following services

o  Data

o  Capability-Data

o  Expedited-Data

o  Typed-Data

o  Token-Please

o  Token-Give

o  Control-Give

o  Sync-Major

o  Sync-Minor

o  Resynchronize

o  Exception-Report

o  Activity-Start

o  Activity-Interrupt

o  Activity-Resume

o  Activity-Discard

o  Activity-End

ROSE API

The Remote Operations Service Element (ROSE) supports the following
OSI standard:

o  ISO 9072 - Information Processing Systems - Text Communication -
   Remote Operations

ROSE supports interactive applications in a distributed open systems
environment. It is a service for multivendor distributed processing.

                                65

 

The ROSE functionality provides a mechanism that allows for the encoding
and decoding of the Remote Operations Protocol Control Inforation,
as defined in ISO 9072, for the following services:

o  Invoke

o  Result

o  Error

o  Reject
