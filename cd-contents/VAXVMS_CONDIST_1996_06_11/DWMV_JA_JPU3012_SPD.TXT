           This Software Product Description describes the following two 
           products:

           o  DECwindows Motif/Japanese Version 1.2-3 for OpenVMS VAX

           o  DECwindows Motif/Japanese Version 1.2-3 for OpenVMS Alpha

           The general description section describes features common to both 
           products. Any differences in product functionality are indicated in
           separate sections that follow.

           In this document, Japanese OpenVMS is referred to as OpenVMS, and 
           DECwindows Motif/Japanese for OpenVMS is referred to as DECwindows 
           Motif or DECwindows.

           DESCRIPTION

           The DECwindows desktop environment provides a graphical user 
           interface to the OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha operating systems. 
           DECwindows incorporates the OSF/Motif[R] user interface as the 
	   design center for DECwindows applications. OSF/Motif[R] is a 
	   graphical user interface widely acknowledged as the industry 
	   standard. This interface allows users to interact with the OpenVMS 
	   VAX and OpenVMS Alpha operating systems using a point-and-click 
	   technique. DECwindows includes a set of integrated desktop 
	   applications that demonstrate the ease-of-use of this user 
	   interface and provides OpenVMS Alpha users with a base set of 
	   desktop tools.

           DECwindows Motif Version 1.2-3 for OpenVMS supports both the 
           DECwindows XUI and the Motif Window Manager. Although the Motif 
           Window Manager is the default window manager, users can switch 
           easily to the XUI Window Manager. The DECwindows desktop productivity
           applications have been converted to use Motif, but they also work 
           with the XUI Window Manager. The DECwindows Motif Version 1.2-3 for 
           OpenVMS layered products also contain run-time support for the XUI, 
           OSF/Motif Release 1.1.3, and OSF/Motif Release 1.2.2 and Release 
           1.2-3 Toolkits. This means that users can run XUI and Motif 
           applications, including native applications and, on OpenVMS Alpha 
           systems, translated applications. (See the Translated Image 
           Environment section of this SPD for more information about running 
           translated applications.)

           DECwindows Motif Version 1.2-3 for OpenVMS is based on the 
           X Consortium's specification for the X Window System[TM], 
           Version 11, Release 5 (X11R5) and OSF/Motif Release 1.2.2. [*] 
           X Window System standards

           ____________________
           [*] Software supplied by the OSF[R] may not be upward compatible 
	       with future DECwindows releases.

           PRODUCT: DECwindows Motif[R]/Japanese Version 1.2-3 for OpenVMS  
	   SPD 28.A8.02


           supported as part of DECwindows Motif include the X11 network proto-
           col, a base set of workstation fonts, the C language binding for the
           Xlib programming library, and the C language binding for the 
	   X Toolkit library.

           Support of the X11 network protocol in the client library and display
           server components provides the OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha operat-
           ing systems with the ability to interoperate with other X11-compliant
           systems in a distributed fashion.

           DECwindows supports the client/server distribution inherent in the 
	   X Window System. This client/server model provides for running 
	   X Window clients on one node and displaying output to another node, 
	   using a transport to communicate between the nodes. The DECwindows 
	   Motif Version 1.2-3 for OpenVMS product provides four transport 
	   interfaces: local shared memory, DECnet, TCP/IP (using Digital's 
	   TCP/IP Services for VMS [UCX] or other third-party products such as
	   Multinet[R] and Wollongong), and LAT. Users can also provide their 
	   own transport subsystems and transport interfaces.

           To determine whether a separately orderable DECwindows Motif based 
	   layered product or X application runs on or can communicate with 
	   DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS VAX or OpenVMS Alpha systems, consult 
	   the application's Software Product Description.

           Internationalization Features

           Locale Switching

           DECwindows Motif/Japanese V1.2-3 for OpenVMS provides a platform for
           developing locale-independent windowing applications. Applications 
	   developed using the technologies of the X11R5 and OSF/Motif R1.2.3 
	   toolkit can exhibit different local language behaviors according to
	   the locale setting.

           DECwindows Motif/Japanese for OpenVMS V1.2-3 is based on the XPG lo-
           cale model. Users can switch the language of an application by 
	   specifying the locale at startup time. This locale switching 
	   mechanism is also designed to be interoperable with other 
	   DECwindows Motif products, such as DEC OSF/1 and ULTRIX Worksystem 
	   Software.

           DECwindows Motif/Japanese for OpenVMS V1.2-3 supports a coexistence
           of different language variants on the same computing system, with the
           possibility of changing easily from one language to another.

           Language Variants Coexistence

           On the same system with DECwindows Motif/Japanese for OpenVMS V1.2-3
	   it is possible to install the following DECwindows Motif V1.2-3 for
           OpenVMS language variants:

           DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS User Environment

           The DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS user environment consists of four 
	   basic components:

           1. Session Manager

           Session Manager provides the top-level user interface to a DECwindows
           workstation. From Session Manager, users can start applications, cus-
           tomize their session, and perform security management. Session 
	   Manager also lets users specify the language user interface for sup-
	   ported DECwindows applications if they have ordered, installed, and 
	   are licensed to use the appropriate DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS 
	   language variant kit(s). For the supported language variants, refer 
	   to the DECwindows Motif OpenVMS User Interface Product SPD.

           For more information about which DECwindows Motif desktop 
	   applications have translated user interfaces, refer to the Software 
	   Product Description (SPD) for that language variant. The DECwindows
	   Motif language variant SPDs also contain information on specific 
	   local hardware and software support provided in the language variant
	   kits.

           2. Window Manager
           
           The Window Manager lets users control the size and placement of win-
           dows. The OSF/Motif Window Manager is provided as the default window
           manager; users can choose instead to work with the DECwindows XUI 
	   Window Manager. The window manager can be chosen by an individual 
	   user or by a system manager for an entire system.

           3. FileView

           FileView, a graphical interface to the OpenVMS file system, allows 
	   users to navigate the file system and to perform operations on files.

           4. DECterm Terminal Emulator

           The DECterm terminal emulator provides workstation users with a tra-
           ditional character-cell interface for existing OpenVMS features and
           applications. It is a VT320 terminal emulator. It supports ReGIS and
           sixel, but is not fully VT340 compatible. Programs written for 
	   VT52-, VT100-, VT220-, or VT320-class terminals and using OpenVMS 
	   terminal driver features operate without modification in this 
	   workstation window. DECterm also provides workstation-oriented 
	   features, such as mouse-based cursor positioning, variable screen 
	   sizes, and cutting and pasting of text between DECterm and other 
	   DECwindows applications. Many programs can also use these features 
	   without modification.

           Desktop Productivity Applications

           DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS provides a set of integrated desktop ap-
           plications that employ a common look and feel to help users easily 
	   master their computing environment.

           Components from each of these areas can be used in any combination to
           address the needs of applications. These components can also use the
           tools from a variety of different programming languages.

           Motif language bindings are provided for the following programming 
	   languages:

           o  DEC Fortran for OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha

           o  DEC Pascal for OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha

           o  DEC C for OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha

           In addition, C header files supplied by the OSF have been modified to
           work with DEC C++. Pascal and Fortran bindings are included in the 
	   DECwindows Motif kit; OSF/Motif "strongly typed" language bindings 
	   for Ada are available in the DEC Ada for OpenVMS (VAX and Alpha) 
	   layered product.

           For additional programming support, the DECW$EXAMPLES directory 
	   includes the following programming examples:

           o  OSF/Motif Release 1.2.2 examples (Motif widget set examples)

           o  X11R4 and X11R5 programming examples (Xlib examples)

           o  Digital-supplied examples

           
	   Programming Support Libraries

           The following sections describe the programming support libraries.

           X Window System (X) Programming Support

           The X Window System compatible X programming library (Xlib) provided
           by DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS supplies basic resource management 
	   (windows, color maps, input devices) and bitmap graphics services. 
	   It defines a mapping of the X network protocol to a procedure 
	   library.

           X Window System Intrinsics Support

           The X Window System Intrinsics library support contains the X Consor-
           tium Release 5 (R5) Intrinsics (X Toolkit). The X Toolkit provides 
	   low-level routines allowing the creation of user interface objects 
	   called widgets.

           OSF/Motif User Interface Programming Support

           OSF/Motif is the user interface for Digital and third-party software
           tailored for the DECwindows environment. It establishes the conven-
           tions and styles for graphical applications. Applications use Motif
           components to build user interfaces that look and feel alike.

           The OSF/Motif Style Guide describes the principles, philosophy, and
           components used to build consistent and well-integrated OSF/Motif 
	   applications. In addition, the DECwindows Companion to the 
	   OSF/Motif Style Guide provides additional information concerning 
	   the style of OSF/Motif user interfaces. This style guide companion 
	   also provides guidelines concerning additional features that Digital
	   provides in the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS offering, and includes
	   a Digital preferred terminology list for a number of supported 
	   languages for developers producing OSF/Motif applications in these 
	   languages.

           The OSF/Motif style concepts are implemented by the OSF/Motif 
	   Toolkit. DECwindows Motif contains both the OSF/Motif and XUI 
	   Toolkits; application run-time support is provided for the OSF/Motif
	   Release 1.2.3, 1.2.2 and 1.1.3 (as well as for the XUI) Toolkits. 
	   The OSF/Motif Toolkit is based on the X Toolkit Intrinsics and 
	   contains three components:

           o  OSF/Motif widgets and gadgets for implementing common user inter-
              face objects, such as scroll bars, menus, and push buttons

           o  Utility routines that provide applications with functions for per-
              forming common tasks, such as cut and paste

           o  Resource manager routines for loading user interface definition 
	      files and creating widgets and gadgets based on the contents of 
	      the definition files

           The OSF/Motif Toolkit is used in conjunction with the OSF/Motif User
           Interface Language (UIL) compiler. The user interface definition 
	   files produced by this compiler contain the data that describes the
	   form of DECwindows applications. These UIL files also allow 
	   OSF/Motif Toolkit widget and gadget information, such as menu item 
	   labels, to be stored

           separately from the toolkit and application run-time code. This 
	   capability allows application developers to prototype and easily 
	   modify user interface designs, to separate form from function in 
	   applications, and to support translatable products that do not 
	   require recompilation of source files.

           Digital's Extensions to OSF/Motif

           The DECwindows Motif product adds value to the standard OSF/Motif 
	   Toolkit by including a library that contains a set of Digital-
	   developed widgets and run-time routines not available from OSF. The
	   following widgets provide a common DECwindows interface for some 
	   commonly used DECwindows functions:

           o  A Color Mix widget that enables users to select and mix colors 
              using a variety of color models.

           o  A Help widget that allows applications to display appropriate Help
              text in a consistent manner. This widget is provided for backward
              compatibility with OpenVMS DECwindows Motif Version 1.0 and has 
	      been superseded by the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS Help system 
	      (hyperhelp).

           o  A Print widget that allows applications to print files in a con-
              sistent manner.

           o  A Structured Visual Navigation (SVN) widget used by applications
              to display hierarchical information.

           The run-time routines include:

           o  Three DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS Help system calls that enable
              users to display online help files using Bookreader.

           o  LinkWorks Services that allow applications to easily participate
              in the LinkWorks Environment. These services provide generic user
              interface and information object manipulation capabilities for 
	      managing LinkWorks Objects.

           o  DECimage run-time support for applications developed using 
	      DECimage Application Services. This support includes the Image 
	      Services Library, Image Display Services, and X Image Extensions.

           Translated Image Environment for DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS Alpha

           DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS Alpha provides an array of services to
           allow the operation of programs that have undergone binary transla-
           tion from DECwindows Motif Version 1.1 or XUI VAX images. These 
	   programs can perform virtually all user-mode functions on DECwindows
	   Motif for OpenVMS Alpha systems. However, DECwindows Motif for 
	   OpenVMS Alpha shareable images that are used with translated images
	   are different from and incompatible with the shareable images used 
	   for native images. Native and translated images that use DECwindows 
	   Motif for OpenVMS Alpha software cannot be used together in a 
	   process.

           SPD 28.A8.02


           Without requiring special source code, the Translated Image Environ-
           ment automatically resolves differences between the VAX and Alpha 
	   architectures, including floating-point registers, condition codes, 
	   exception handling, ASTs, and others.

           The Translated Image Environment included with DECwindows Motif for
           OpenVMS Alpha is sufficient to run images that have been translated
           elsewhere. The DECmigrate layered product can be used to translate 
	   images linked with the OSF/Motif Release 1.1.3 Toolkit (shipped in 
	   DECwindows Motif Version 1.1 for OpenVMS VAX) for running on an 
	   OpenVMS Alpha system. For additional information on the precise 
	   characteristics of programs suitable for binary translation, refer 
	   to the DECmigrate Software Product Description (SPD 39.44.xx).

           XUI to Motif Porting Tools

           Digital provides porting tools to aid programmers in porting appli-
           cations to Motif. These tools replace occurrences of XUI names in the
           input source file with the correct Motif names.

           CDA Programming Support

           The CDA Toolkit provides access routines that applications can use to
           create, read, and write files containing compound text, graphics, and
           imaging data. These files provide a vehicle for recording this 
	   information on disk, a medium for interchange of this data between 
	   applications, and an intermediate form from which high-resolution 
	   printable graphics data can be generated.

           Enhanced X Windows Display PostScript (XDPS)

           The Display PostScript System provided with DECwindows Motif for 
	   OpenVMS extends the native X graphical programming environment for 
	   DECwindows users displaying text or images on workstations that 
	   support the XDPS extension.

           X Display PostScript adds the following capabilities to the basic X11
           environment:

           o  Most DECwindows fonts can be displayed at any size and rotation 
	      angle.

           o  XDPS graphics are specified in a user-defined coordinate system 
	      independent of monitor density.

           o  Color or gray-scale rendition is automatically modified to take 
	      advantage of the monitor type through either direct display, 
	      color dithering, or half toning.

           o  DPS Display routines can be downloaded to the server and executed
              on command.

           o  Sophisticated graphics primitives, such as precisely controlled 
	      Bezier curves, can be displayed.

           o  Any display can be scaled and rotated arbitrarily.

           Programming access to XDPS is through the Adobe[R] Client Library. 
	   In addition, a converter called pswrap allows users to convert 
	   PostScript code into C programs that can be called from other 
	   languages.

           DECwindows X11 Display Server for OpenVMS Extension Support

           The X11 server protocol is implemented on both the OpenVMS VAX and 
	   the OpenVMS Alpha operating systems. As of OpenVMS VAX Version 6.0, 
	   the DECwindows X11 display server on OpenVMS VAX supports the full 
	   X11 protocol and contains significant portions of the Release 4 (R4)
	   and Release 5 (R5) code base, plus some optional extensions. By 
	   contrast, the DECwindows X11 display server for OpenVMS Alpha is a 
	   direct port of the X Window System Version 11, Release 5 (X11R5) 
	   display server, plus some optional extensions.

           The DECwindows X11 display server is an optional part of the OpenVMS
           VAX and OpenVMS Alpha kits. The DECwindows X11 display server, 
	   including device drivers and fonts, can be selected for installation
	   during the OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha installation procedures.

           The DECwindows X11 display server for OpenVMS supports the following
           extensions. Client libraries for these extensions are included in the
           DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS VAX and DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS 
	   Alpha layered products.
