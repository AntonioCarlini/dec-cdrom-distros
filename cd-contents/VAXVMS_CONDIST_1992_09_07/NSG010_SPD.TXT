           PRODUCT NAME:  DEC SecurityGate for VMS,     SPD 36.20.00
                          Version 1.0

           DESCRIPTION

           DEC SecurityGate software is a VMS software product that,
           when installed on a DECnet Phase IV routing node, provides
           an additional level of access control to that part of the
           network served by the routing node. A system or security man-
           ager can use the DEC SecurityGate software to create a se-
           curity domain consisting of a group of nodes serviced by the
           router.

           A system or security manager defines a set of access rules
           that apply to the security domain. Access to nodes in the
           security domain can be specified and controlled based on source
           and destination nodes, inbound and outbound communication
           lines, network object or task, and the day of week and hour
           of day.

           The DEC SecurityGate software consists of a VMS pseudo driver
           that provides the network access control, a user interface
           program that creates and maintains rules databases and con-
           trols the loading of network access control rules, and an
           Ancillary Control Process (ACP) that provides event logging
           and loads rules into the pseudo driver.

           DEC SecurityGate software pseudo driver software becomes part
           of the DECnet-VAX routing layer and examines each network
           packet passing through. Each packet is examined to deter-
           mine if it is a Connect Request or a Reconnect Request. Only
           Connect and Reconnect Requests are further examined; all oth-
           ers are passed back to the router for forwarding.

           The DEC SecurityGate forwards Connect Requests if permit-
           ted by the access rules but rejects Connect Requests if pro-
           hibited by the rules. Since only Connect Request packets and
           Reconnect Request packets are examined, the effect on net-
           work routing performance is small.

           The ACP maintains an audit event file that automatically records
           all failed network connections and changes to the access rules.
           The User Interface will display the entire audit file or cre-
           ate a report from selected portions which, in turn, can be
           either displayed or printed as a separate file.

           The User Interface also provides a test function. A secu-
           rity manager can determine if the rules that are defined will
           behave as expected by simulating Connect Requests and ver-
           ifying that the rules either permit or deny access.

           HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

           VAX, MicroVAX, VAXstation, or VAXserver configuration as spec-
           ified in the System Support Addendum (SSA 36.20.00-x).

           A TK50 tape drive is required for standalone MicroVAX 2000
           and VAXstation 2000 systems.

           SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

           For Systems Using Terminals (No DECwindows Interface):
