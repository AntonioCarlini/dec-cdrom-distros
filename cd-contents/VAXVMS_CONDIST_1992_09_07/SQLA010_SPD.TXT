 PRODUCT NAME:  SQL Access Server for Rdb/VMS,          SPD 40.89.00
                Version 1.0

 DESCRIPTION

 SQL Access Server for Rdb/VMS is Digital's first product offering based
 on specifications for remote database access that have been developed
 by The SQL Access Group, a consortium of more than forty software de-
 velopment companies.
 The SQL Access model, developed by the SQL Access Group, is an open
 architecture providing application programs read/write access to data
 in multiple relational database management systems. The SQL Access model
 is based on client/server architecture. The SQL Access Server for Rdb/VMS
 enables SQL Access client applications on any platform to perform read
 and write access to data in any Rdb/VMS database on the network. In-
 formation passed between the client and the server implements the Re-
 mote Database Access (RDA) protocol published by ISO (ISO DIS 9579-
 1 and ISO DIS 9579-2). This RDA protocol includes a means to encode
 both database requests and results. The SQL Access Server for Rdb/VMS
 maps database requests to VAX SQL statements which executes them. Sta-
 tus information and results are returned to the client application that
 originated the request in accordance with the RDA protocol.

 Components

 The SQL Access Server consists of a multi-threaded communications server
 and a pool of execution servers. The execution servers are detached
 processes which perform the actual database work on behalf of the client
 applications.

 The communication server manages association (connection) requests from
 clients and directs association requests to execution server processes
 for processing. The execution server process responds to the associ-
 ation requests from clients on the Rdb/VMS database and processes clients'
 requests for database operations and returns results to clients.

 A single system-wide log file is used to help the system manager un-
 derstand the system load for correct set-up and tuning by means of a
 configuration file. The configuration file is used to specify the ini-
 tial and maximum number of execution servers, and the maximum number
 of reusable (permanent) execution servers. The configuration file spec-
 ifies classes of events to be logged and the location of the log file.
 The server shutdown time is also specified in the configuration file.
