     PRODUCT NAME:  DEC Commserver for VMS, Version 1.0  SPD 33.21.00

     DESCRIPTION

     DEC Commserver for VMS is a layered software product that al-
     lows VMS host systems to communicate with suitably configured
     server systems over the Ethernet. The DEC Commserver for VMS
     software package is composed of both host and server functional
     components. The host components include an Application Inter-
     face Driver that implements the Simpact Associates' application
     programming interface (API); a host transport driver which in-
     terfaces to the system's Ethernet Driver; and configuration and
     management drivers. The server components within DEC Commserver
     for VMS include:

     o  Commserver transport driver

     o  Transfer application

     o  Management and device processes

     o  VAXELN Operating System

     o  Communication protocols

     Features

     Transparency

     The DEC Commserver's application interface driver permits users
     to utilize their existing Simpact applications as if the Simpact
     hardware (ICP1622) were installed in the host. Application pro-
     grams are able to perform $QIO requests to the DEC Commserver's
     host transport driver - all transparent to the host application.

     DEC Commserver for VMS, Version 1.0                 SPD 33.21.00



     DEC Commserver for VMS can be configured to interface with
     multiple servers and conversely, servers can be configured
     to interface with multiple hosts. Any combination of host and
     server connections can be made up of a maximum configuration of
     31 hosts and/or 31 servers on a single LAN. Users must follow
     configuration and performance guidelines, since the total number
     of communications lines supported is a function of line speeds
     and line utilization.

     Supportability

     Simpact Associates software protocols for the DEC Commserver are
     supported by Digital when purchased with the DEC Commserver for
     VMS software.

     Multiplicity

     A wide variety of Simpact protocols are available with DEC Comm-
     server for VMS. These protocols are included on the DEC Comm-
     server media, and can only be used by ordering the appropriate
     software license. Refer to Software Licenses in the ORDERING
     INFORMATION section.

     interface provides multi-point communications allowing a primary
     station to communicate with multiple secondary stations. Line
     speed, utilizing four simultaneous lines, is 19.2K bits per
     second.

     Commserver ADCCP ABM

     Complying with ANSI X.366-1979 and FED-STD-1003A standards, the
     interface provides high-speed, point-to-point communications
     and is well-suited to satellite communications. Line speed,
     utilizing four simultaneous lines, is 19.2K bits per second.

     Commserver BSC 2780/3780 and BSC 3270

     These interfaces connect non-IBM[R] systems to traditional IBM
     computing environments, performing point-to-point file transfer
     or connecting systems to IBM 3270 display devices within a
     multi-drop network. Line speed, utilizing four simultaneous
     lines, is 19.2K bits per second.

     Commserver FMP

     This interface connects computers to nearly all systems that
     broadcast stock, bond, and commodity information including SIAC,
     NASDAQ, OPRA, and NYSE. Line speed, utilizing four simultaneous
     lines, is 19.2K bits per second.

     Commserver AUTODIN

     Certified per DCA circular 370-D195-1, the interface connects
     systems to message centers within the store-and-forward AUTODIN
     network. Asynchronous line speed, utilizing four simultane-
     ous lines, is 19.2K bits per second; synchronous line speed,
     utilizing four simultaneous lines, is 4.8K bits per second.

     This interface is configurable for a variety of parameters.
     These parameters include data rate, protocol type, and QIO
     access.

     Performance

     DEC Commserver for VMS performance is measured in terms of
     the performance of the individual components. In particular,
     customers must be aware of the performance restrictions of the
     communications devices being used. Simpact's ICP1622 and EXC1612
     modules are capable of supporting line speeds up to 64K bits per
     second. However, the anticipated performance of any individual
     communication line must consider data throughput needs, the
     protocol(s) used, the number of communication lines per DEC
     Commserver system, and the density of traffic on the Ethernet.
