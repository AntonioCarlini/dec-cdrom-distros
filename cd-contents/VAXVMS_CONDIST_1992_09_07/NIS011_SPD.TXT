 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC Network Integration Server Software, Version 1.1 SPD
 36.05.02

 DESCRIPTION

 The DEC Network Integration Server (DECNIS) software runs on any DEC
 Network Integration Server 500 or 600 series hardware unit. It pro-
 vides routing, bridging and X.25 gateway services to network systems
 located on a Local Area Network (LAN) or connected directly to the hard-
 ware unit over synchronous line connections.

 Overview

 The DECNIS software provides a multi-protocol routing service for:

 o  TCP/IP hosts

 o  OSI-compatible systems

 o  DECnet/OSI Phase V nodes

 o  DECnet Phase IV nodes

 These end systems may be located on the same LAN or directly connected
 to the synchronous communications ports of the DECNIS hardware unit.
 Multiprotocol routing is implemented using the ISO Intermediate Sys-
 tem to Intermediate System (IS-IS) Routing Exchange Protocol extended
 to handle both TCP/IP and DECnet network traffic. Routing of TCP/IP
 traffic is also supported using RIP in DECnet areas without the need
 for IS-IS routing in the area.

 The DECNIS software provides a bridging service for any end-system lo-
 cated on any LAN connected to the DECNIS hardware unit which gener-
 ates LAN traffic which is not routable by the DECNIS routing service.
 This traffic can be bridged to another LAN connected locally to the
 DECNIS hardware unit or remotely to a LAN connected to another DEC-
 NIS hardware unit across a wide area link.

                               DIGITAL                     June 1992

                                                         AE-PQBSC-TE

 

 The DECNIS can also provide an X.25 gateway service to relay X.25 level
 3 packets to and from Digital and non-Digital systems on a LAN, X.25
 Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) connected directly to the unit or con-
 nected over an X.25 Packet Switched Data Network (PSDN).

 The DECNIS software image is installed and configured on a VMS, VAX/ULTRIX
 or RISC/ULTRIX system (termed a load host). The load host may be:

 o  Located on the same LAN or extended LAN as the DECNIS hardware unit

 o  Accessible from another DECNIS connected directly to the target hard-
    ware unit over one or more synchronous links

 Once configured, the software image is downline loaded to the hard-
 ware unit from the load host.

 The DECNIS software can be managed from any VMS or ULTRIX end system
 using either the DECnet Network Command Language (NCL) or the DEC Man-
 agement Control Center (DECmcc). Monitoring of the Internet functions
 of the software can be performed from any system supporting the Sim-
 ple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). A separate data tracing util-
 ity available on VMS systems assists problem solving by tracing con-
 trol messages received or sent by the DECNIS software.

 DECnet Routing

 The DECNIS software implements both the DECnet Phase IV routing al-
 gorithm (routing vector) and the DECnet/OSI Phase V routing algorithm
 (link-state routing). The DECNIS software supports both intra-area rout-
 ing (Level 1) and inter-area routing (Level 2). The DECNIS software
 can run either the Phase IV or Phase V routing algorithm in either com-
 bination at each level. When running the Phase V algorithms at either
 level 1 or level 2, the routing software is still able to handle traf-
 fic generated by DECnet Phase IV end systems and performs any neces-
 sary address and header conversions.

 Communication with other DECnet end or intermediate systems over the
 synchronous connections can use either HDLC or X.25 data link circuits.


                                  2

 

 The DECNIS software supports path splitting over up to four routing
 circuits. If the cost between the router and the destination node is
 the same on multiple synchronous circuits, then the DECNIS software
 splits the traffic across the circuits.

 Internet Routing

 The DECNIS software provides support for the following IP routing pro-
 tocols:

 o  RIP (RFC 1058)

 o  Integrated IS-IS (RFC 1195)

 o  EGP (RFCs 827, 888 and 904)

 Integrated IS-IS is OSI IS-IS Intra-Domain routing, with additions to
 support IP routing as defined in RFC 1195. An IS-IS routing circuit
 is required in order to handle IP traffic either within a level one
 area or between areas over a level 2 link. It is also possible to route
 IP traffic using RIP within a DECnet Phase IV only network by running
 RIP over the DECnet Phase IV level 1 or level 2 links.

 In addition to IP routing protocols, the software also supports IP reach-
 able addresses (static routes) over any circuit.

 When using Integrated IS-IS, the software supports equal-cost path split-
 ting of IP data over up to four equal-cost paths. Variable, but con-
 tiguous, IP subnet masks are also supported.

 The DECNIS software can communicate directly with IP hosts or gate-
 ways over CSMA/CD or dynamically assigned X.25 circuits. It interop-
 erates with other IP gateways using RIP or EGP on these circuits. For-
 ward of IP traffic over X.25 circuits is in accordance with RFC 877.

 When operating over HDLC and X.25 static circuits, the software only
 communicates directly with other Digital routers. When operating over
 X.25 dynamic circuits, the software can communicate with other routers
 which support the OSI connectionless network service over X.25 data
 links.

                                  3

 

 The DECNIS software communicates with IP hosts and gateways using the
 ARP protocol on CSMA/CD circuits (RFC 826). Proxy ARP (RFC 1027) is
 also supported.

 OSI Routing

 The DECNIS software fully implements the requirements of an OSI In-
 termediate System. The DECNIS software exchanges information about reach-
 ability of end systems using the OSI Intermediate System to Interme-
 diate System (IS-IS) Intra-Domain Routing Exchange Protocol as spec-
 ified in ISO/IEC 10589. OSI-compatible end systems on the same Local
 Area Network can exchange information with the DECNIS software and use
 the OSI End System to Intermediate System (ES-IS) Routing Exchange Pro-
 tocol as specified in ISO 9542.

 The DECNIS software uses the OSI Connectionless Network Protocol (CLNP),
 as specified in ISO 8473, to communicate with OSI-compatible systems
 over an ISO 8802/3 or IEEE 802.3 Local Area Network. Communication over
 the synchronous links uses either the HDLC or the X.25 packet-level
 protocols.

 X.25 Routing Circuits

 The DECNIS software supports the use of statically and dynamically as-
 signed X.25 routing circuits. Static circuits are established when the
 routing circuit is enabled and remain set up until the routing cir-
 cuit is disabled. Dynamically assigned circuits are established only
 when there is information to send over the routing circuit. They are
 disconnected when there is no further information to send.

 The DECNIS software supports more than one connection to one or more
 X.25 PSDNs. The software can share outgoing calls between all the DTEs
 connected to a PSDN. The DECNIS software supports routing over either
 Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVCs) or Switched Virtual Circuits (SVCs).

 Each X.25 virtual circuit can run only one routing protocol. However,
 different routing protocols can be run over separate virtual circuits
 on the same X.25 DTE connection.

 Bridging

                                  4

 

 The DECNIS software supports both local and remote bridging of any data
 traffic which cannot be routed e.g. Digital's LAT, PC LAN protocols
 such as Novell Netware, Xerox XNS, Apple Corporation Appletalk.

 Bridging of IP, DECnet or OSI datagrams is not supported. These pro-
 tocols are always routed by the software.

 The DECNIS software implements the IEEE 802.1D Spanning Tree Proto-
 col and will inter-operate with other Digital or IEEE 802.1D compli-
 ant bridges in the same extended LAN.

 When used as a local bridge, the DECNIS software forwards data pack-
 ets from one LAN interface to another LAN interface. When used as a
 remote bridge, the DECNIS software forwards data packets from one LAN
 interface, through the DEC WANcontroller 622 interface card to a sim-
 ilar card on another DECNIS hardware unit. Remote bridging between LANs
 is supported only over a single hop; multiple hops are not supported.
 Remote bridging is only supported on the high speed DEC WANcontroller
 622 network interface card; it is not supported on the DEC WANcontroller
 618 network interface card.

 Bridge traffic, both local and remote, may be filtered based on a com-
 bination of source or destination address and protocol type on a port
 by port basis.

 X.25 Gateway

 When operating as an X.25 Gateway, the DECNIS software transmits and
 receives X.25 packets to and from any of the following systems:

 o  Any Digital systems which support the DNA Gateway Access Protocol
    (GAP).

 o  Any systems located on the same LAN which support the ISO Logical
    Link Control 2 (LLC2) protocol (as described in ISO 8881).

 o  Any X.25 DTE accessible over an X.25 Public Switched Data Network
    (PSDN) connected to the DECNIS.

 o  Any X.25 DTE connected directly to a synchronous port of the DEC-
    NIS operating in X.25 DCE mode (ISO 8208 point-to-point mode).

                                  5

 

 o  Any X.25 DTE connected to any other Digital X.25 Gateway server ac-
    cessible to the DECNIS over the DECnet/OSI routing network.

 When providing wide area access to an X.25 PSDN for end systems on the
 LAN which use LLC2, the DECNIS software fully implements the recom-
 mendations in ISO Technical Report 10029 as a CONS LAN/WAN relay.

 X.25 packets can be relayed locally between any X.25 DTE attached to
 the DECNIS hardware unit and any other similarly attached X.25 DTE or
 any X.25 system connected to the same LAN. Additionally, X.25 pack-
 ets can be relayed to remote X.25 DTEs accessible to other DEC X.25
 Gateway servers over a DECnet/OSI routing network. The software does
 not support the relaying of X.25 packets generated from an X.25 DTE
 connected to an X.25 PSDN to an X.25 DTE connected to another X.25 PSDN.

 The DECNIS software supports both Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVC) and
 Switched Virtual Circuits (SVC) and allows multiple connections to one
 or more PSDNs. Most major international public X.25 PSDNs are supported.
 For a current list of public X.25 PSDNs and X.25(1984) optional fa-
 cilities supported by the DECNIS, refer to the System Support Adden-
 dum (SSA 36.05.02-x).

 The following accounting information is provided by the DECNIS X.25
 Gateway software:

 o  Logging of virtual circuit accounting when calls are cleared

 o  Logging of accounting records to a designated Event Logging sink

 o  Logging to multiple sinks for reliability

 The following security mechanisms are supported in the DECNIS X.25 Gate-
 way software:

 o  Inbound and outbound calls can be controlled on the basis of the
    remote DTE, the application, and, if applicable, the X.25 Access
    node

 o  Access to accounting sink management is restricted to authorized
    users

                                  6

 

 o  Access to accounting source management is restricted to authorized
    users

 Installation and Configuration

 The minimum requirement is for one host to load the DECNIS hardware
 unit. However, the DECNIS software can be installed on a number of load
 hosts. This helps to protect against loss of service if a single load
 host is unavailable, or unable to load the system for any other rea-
 son.

 Installation is performed using VMSINSTAL (on VMS) or setld (on UL-
 TRIX). The software must be configured using two configuration pro-
 grams supplied with the product. These configuration programs allow
 the network manager to set up the downline load database and to de-
 fine the required DECNIS management entities.

 The DECNIS hardware unit must be located on the same LAN as the load
 host or connected by a synchronous circuit to another operating DEC-
 NIS system. When loading over synchronous links, the DECNIS system per-
 forming the loading operation is configured to copy the required files
 from any load host by establishing a DECnet connection to that load
 host. Loading of DECNIS units may also be daisy-chained over a sequence
 of synchronous links. The only restriction here is the first DECNIS
 in the chain must be on the same LAN as the load host and each mem-
 ber of the chain must be another DECNIS unit. The DECNIS unit can also
 be used to load any other Digital device which supports Digital's Main-
 tenance Operation Protocol (MOP) over synchronous links.

 Management

 The DECNIS software conforms to both the Digital Enterprise Manage-
 ment Architecture (EMA) and the Internet Structure of Management In-
 formation. Access to the manageable entities is supported using ei-
 ther the OSI Control Management Information Protocol (CMIP) or the Sim-
 ple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).




                                  7

 

 Permanent changes to the configuration of the DECNIS software can be
 made by using the configuration utilities to create a script file and
 then rebooting the hardware unit. Temporary changes to the configu-
 ration of the DECNIS software can be made by using any EMA-compliant
 Director such as NCL or DECmcc from any available system.

 Other management tasks can also be performed from Network Management
 directors allowing the network manager to:

 o  Manage specific connections, for example, set up the data links,
    enable and disable circuits.

 o  Monitor network traffic, for example, enable event logging, dis-
    play counters.

 o  Resolve problems, for example, test circuit availability, perform
    loopback tests.

 An additional utility called Common Tracing Facility (CTF) is avail-
 able on VMS systems to assist with problem solving by tracing control
 messages as they are processed by the DECNIS software.

 Information about Internet variables held on the DECNIS software can
 also be accessed by Network Management systems using the Simple Net-
 work Management Protocol (SNMP). The DECNIS software implements the
 Management Information Base-II (MIB-II) variables which can be read
 by any SNMP management station. Note that support is not provided for
 modifying these variables from an SNMP management station.

 Physical Line Support

 The DECNIS hardware units are modular, expandable, hardware platforms.
 The DECNIS 500 is a four-slot enclosure; the DECNIS 600 is a nine-slot
 enclosure. The first two slots are reserved for Management Processor
 and Pool Memory cards; the remaining slots are available for Network
 Interface Cards. The DECNIS software operates on all DECNIS 500 and
 DECNIS 600 configurations.



                                  8

 

 The following Network Interface Cards are supported by the DECNIS 500
 /600 series hardware units. The DECNIS 500 can contain up to two Net-
 work Interface Cards; the DECNIS 600 can contain up to seven Network
 Interface Cards.

 o  DEC LANcontroller 601 - Single-port Ethernet/IEEE 802.3 interface

 o  DEC WANcontroller 618 - Eight-port, low-speed synchronous inter-
    face support line speeds from 1.2
    Kbits/s to 64 Kbits/s

 o  DEC WANcontroller 622 - Dual-port, high-speed synchronous inter-
    face support line speeds from 56
    Kbits/s to 2 Mbits/s

 Communication over the synchronous lines is full-duplex with full mo-
 dem control on all synchronous line(s). The synchronous port(s) can
 operate as HDLC point-to-point links or X.25 LAPB/LAPBE links.

 Both the DEC WANcontroller 618 and 622 synchronous interfaces support
 V.24 interchange circuits with the following electrical interfaces:

 o  DEC WANcontroller 618:

    -  V.28 (EIA-RS232-D/EIA-RS232-C)

    -  V.36/V.11 (RS449/RS422)

    -  V.35

 o  DEC WANcontroller 622:

    -  V.36/V.11 (RS449/RS422)

    -  V.35

    -  CCITT X.21 (Leased line services)

    -  British Telecom Kilostream

 The number of lines supported depends on the synchronous interface and
 the number of these interfaces installed in the hardware unit.

                                  9

 

 For the DEC WANcontroller 618, separate distribution panels are re-
 quired for support of RS232/V.28, RS422/V.11, and V.35 interfaces. For
 use with British Telecom Kilostream services, an extra adapter cable
 is used in conjunction with the RS422/V.11 distribution panel. Refer
 to the System Support Addendum (SSA 36.05.02-x) for further informa-
 tion on the required adapter cable.

 For the DEC WANcontroller 622, separate adapter cables provide the nec-
 essary interchange circuits for each synchronous line. Refer to the
 System Support Addendum (SSA 36.05.02-x) for further information on
 the required adapter cables.

 When used with T1 or G.703 lines, the additional requirements for op-
 eration of the DEC WANcontroller 622 are as follows:

 o  The DEC WANcontroller 622 supports only clear channel interfaces.
    Connection to a T1 or G.703 line requires a V.35/RS422 to T1/G.703
    DSU/CSU converter to provide framing to meet CCITT G.704. The DEC
    WANcontroller 622 does not provide either T1 framing pulses or sep-
    arate channels for 64 Kbits/s control data for G.703.

 o  The DEC WANcontroller 622 does not guarantee line density. T1 links
    can offer only 1.536 Mbits/s or 1.344 Mbits/s rates. 1.536 Mbits
    /s rates require the DSU/CSU converter to offer B8ZS and the line
    to accept bipolar violations. 1.334 Mbits/s rates require the DSU
    /CSU converter to offer B7.

 o  Transmit clocking should be provided by the DCE, CCITT 114. The DEC
    WANcontroller 622 uses CCITT 114 to clock data out of the DTE and
    will source a CCITT 113 transmit clock. CCITT 113 should be used
    by the DCE to receive the transmit data. The DEC WANcontroller 622
    implements CCITT 113 as a buffered version of CCITT 114. This clock-
    ing scheme ensures both network synchronization and minimized skew
    between the clock and data for a range of cable lengths and param-
    eters.





                                 10

 

 If the above transmit clocking mechanism is not provided by the DCE,
 this DCE must provide a method of adjusting the phase of the clock used
 to sample the data with respect to that supplied to the DTE. This re-
 quires that the DCE provides test points to allow analysis of the clock
 and data waveforms and that this adjustment is performed on instal-
 lation and after any subsequent alteration of the connection cable.
 This alternative method is also required for DCEs utilizing the X.21
 interface.

 For more information about CSU/DSU converters supported by the DEC WAN-
 controller 622, please refer to the System Support Addendum (SSA 36.05.02-
 x).

 Network Size and Supported Circuits

 DECnet Phase IV networks are hierarchical networks that can be seg-
 mented into up to 63 areas, each containing up to 1023 nodes. Note these
 are maximum values permitted by the Digital Network Architecture and
 satisfactory operation in large networks requires proper network plan-
 ning.

 DECnet/OSI Phase V domains can be virtually unlimited. However, the
 actual size of a domain is limited by the product's memory size and
 processor power. Table 1 lists the values of the parameters used to
 determine the size of the supported network for DECNIS 500 and 600 se-
 ries hardware units.

 Note these figures are given as a rough guide only. Actual sizes ex-
 perienced will depend on a number of factors including the topolog-
 ical characteristics of the network, the mix of protocols and data link
 interfaces, and the amount of routing control traffic generated by the
 network. Please consult your local Digital office for more details and
 for assistance with network sizing and planning.

 Processor Restriction

 A TK50 tape drive is required for standalone MicroVAX
 2000 and VAXstation 2000 systems.

 Every load host on which the DECNIS software is installed must con-
 tain:

 o  A valid system configuration for the relevant operating system and
    for the appropriate DECnet product (refer to the DECnet and appro-
    priate operating system SPDs).

 o  A supported direct LAN or WAN connection to the DEC Network Inte-
    gration Server hardware unit.

    or

 o  A network connection to a DEC Network Integration Server hardware
    unit connected directly over a synchronous link to the unit to be
    loaded.

 o  An appropriate device available to read the software during instal-
    lation:

    -  Magnetic tape drive

    -  TK50 tape drive

 Block Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1):

 For both VMS and ULTRIX operating systems are as follows:
 

 Disk space required for    30,000 blocks
 installation:

                            (15 Mbytes)

 Disk space required for    15,000 blocks
 permanent use:

                            (7.5 Mbytes)

                                  7

 

 These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
 sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
 system environment, configuration, and software options. The space in-
 dicated for permanent occupancy does not include the space required
 to receive an upline dump if that facility is enabled. The amount of
 space required for dumps depends on the exact hardware configuration.
 This could be from 20,000 to 60,000 blocks (10 to 30 Mbytes) for each
 dump depending on the DECNIS configuration.

 The DECNIS software requires either a DECNIS 500 or DECNIS 600 series
 hardware unit.

 One or more of the following Network Interface Cards are required for
 establishing local or remote connections with other intermediate or
 end systems:

 o  DEC LANcontroller 601 - single port Ethernet/IEEE 802.3 interface

 o  DEC WANcontroller 618 - eight-port low-speed synchronous interface
    supporting line speeds from 1.2 Kbits/s to 64 Kbits/s

 o  DEC WANcontroller 622 - two-port high-speed synchronous interface
    supporting line speeds from 56 Kbits/s to 2 Mbits/s

 Note that remote bridging is only supported when using the DEC WAN-
 controller 622 network interface card; it is not supported when us-
 ing the DEC WANcontroller 618 network interface card.

 Adapter Cables

 The DEC WANcontroller 622 requires adapter cables to provide the nec-
 essary interchange circuits at the appropriate electrical interfaces
 and ISO standard connections for each synchronous line. One of these
 cables is needed for each line used.

 When connecting to the British Telecom Kilostream service, the DEC WAN-
 controller 618 requires a special adapter cable to connect to the V.36
 /RS422 distribution panel. For all other services, only a modem con-
 nection cable is required to connect the appropriate DEC WANcontroller
 618 distribution panel. When connecting the the BT Kilostream service

                                  8

 

 using the DEC WANcontroller 622, the CCITT X.21 adapter cable should
 be used.

 Table 1 shows the cable numbers for each of the electrical interface
 types.

 fice for a list of compatible CSU/DSU converters available in your coun-
 try.

 Notes:

 1. This is not applicable to a DTE. This product does not support the
    reception of a level 3 Reject packet, and will not generate one.

                                 14

 

 2. Each DTE must be assigned a unique address independent of the hunt
    group address. The DECNIS software can then ignore the hunt group.
    Alternatively, each line can be configured as if it were connected
    to a separate PSDN with each line having the same DTE address. In
    either case, all the lines must be connected to the same DECNIS soft-
    ware.

 3. This product does not generate these statistics. However, an X.25
    Client system can obtain statistics supplied by the PSDN through
    the programming interface.

 4. The information contained in these fields is passed transparently
    and only has end-to-end significance.

 The DECNIS software does not support the following items of the CCITT
 X.25 recommendation:

 -  Multi-link protocol

 -  Use of the D-bit in outgoing packets

 Unless otherwise acknowledged within the product's documentation, the
 trademarks under which services are offered are proprietary to the re-
 spective national PTT, the owning or operating companies, or equiv-
 alent organization.

 CLUSTER ENVIRONMENT

 This layered product is fully supported when installed on any valid
 and licensed VAXcluster* configuration without restrictions. The HARD-
 WARE REQUIREMENTS sections of this product's Software Product Descrip-
 tion and System Support Addendum detail any special hardware required
 by this product.

 *  V5.x VAXcluster configurations are fully described in the VAXclus-
    ter Software Product Description (29.78.xx) and include CI, Eth-
    ernet and Mixed Interconnect configurations.

 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

                                 15

 

 The DECNIS software requires at least one system to act as a load host.
 That system needs to be a VAX-based system running the VMS or ULTRIX
 operating system, or a RISC-based system running the ULTRIX Operat-
 ing System.

 Each VMS system acting as a load host or dump receiver requires:

 o  VMS Operating System V5.4 - V5.5

 o  DECnet-VAX V5.4 - V5.5 (DECnet-VAX Extension V5.4 kit must be in-
    stalled)

 Each VAX/ULTRIX system acting as a load host or dump receiver requires:

 o  ULTRIX Operating System V4.2 or
    ULTRIX Worksystem Software V4.2

 o  DECnet/OSI for ULTRIX V5.0 - V5.1

 Each RISC/ULTRIX system acting as a load host or dump receiver requires
 the following:

 o  ULTRIX Operating System V4.2 - V4.2A or

    ULTRIX Worksystem Software V4.2 - V4.2A

 o  DECnet/OSI for ULTRIX V5.0 - V5.1
