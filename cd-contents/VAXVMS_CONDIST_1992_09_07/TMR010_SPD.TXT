 PRODUCT NAME:  TeamRoute for VMS, Version 1.0          SPD 41.96.00

 DESCRIPTION

 TeamRoute for VMS is an electronic document initiation, routing, ap-
 proval, and tracking system. It works between members of an organi-
 zation distributed across wide-area and/or local-area networks. It is
 designed to accommodate the primary attributes of paper-based docu-
 ment processing systems with the added flexibility, security, and ef-
 ficiency common to electronic processing systems. The design consid-
 ers the diverse and ever-changing needs of an organization's admin-
 istrative systems.

 TeamRoute uses the master routing package as the model for gathering,
 disseminating, processing, and presenting information. It allows an
 end user to select a template from a library of templates, create a
 new routing package from that template, specify the routing list, en-
 ter information into applicable fields, attach any relevant informa-
 tion, and route the master routing package and any attachments to users
 or other applications for processing and/or approval/disapproval.

 TeamRoute for VMS uses a Client/Server model. This model supports in-
 teraction among a heterogeneous group of Clients and among multiple
 Server domains. TeamRoute for VMS supports MS®-Windows[TM] and VMS Video
 Terminal Clients. TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1 supports the TeamRoute ALL-IN-1
 Client. Refer to the Software Product Description (SPD 33.75.xx) for
 TeamRoute for ALL-IN-1.

 TeamRoute functionality on the Microsoft® Windows platform is only avail-
 able as part of the TeamLinks product set. Refer to the Software Prod-
 uct Description (SPD 37.36.xx) for TeamLinks Information Manager for
 Microsoft Windows.

 TeamRoute routing packages are received as mail messages, which al-
 lows mail to serve as the notification mechanism for incoming corre-
 spondence and allows users to file and organize the TeamRoute rout-
 ing packages in the ALL-IN-1 MAIL File Cabinet. TeamRoute for VMS shares
 nicknames with ALL-IN-1 MAIL.

 Transport between TeamRoute Servers and TeamRoute Clients is performed
 by the VAX Message Router. As a result, TeamRoute allows routing of
 documents across wide-area, store-and-forward networks as well as within
 departmental local-area networks.

 Features

 Client/Server Model

 Users interact with the TeamRoute Client to create routing package mas-
 ters and respond to routing copies. The Server completes the process-
 ing by routing the document, updating the master, and sending track-
 ing copies.

 Run-Time Library

 The TeamRoute Run-Time Library allows users to develop applications
 which access the data in a routing package. These applications are in-
 voked by the TeamRoute Client when a user reads a routing package. Ap-
 plications can be written to exchange data between a routing package
 and a database, or to extract data from a routing package and display
 it to the user as form field data via a callable forms package.

 Templates

 Master routing packages are produced from modifiable templates. Tem-
 plates include assignable roles which allow users to stipulate rout-
 ing policies and receipt actions for a master routing package.

 Sample Applications

 TeamRoute provides several sample applications in the form of pre-defined
 templates. These sample applications demonstrate the capabilities of
 TeamRoute and can be used by users with or without modifications. These
 sample applications include: Action Item Tracking, Document Review and

                                  2

 

 Signoff, Read and Acknowledge, Telephone Slip, Account Request Form,
 Meeting Notice, Answer a Question, and Travel Authorization. Routing
 Packages

 A routing package is the object that is created by the initiator and
 routed to recipients. It is created by selecting a template and fill-
 ing out the routing list, adding attachments, signing it, and send-
 ing it. The routing package at this point becomes the "Master" and is
 stored in the initiator's File Cabinet. Routing copies are sent to re-
 cipients who can add attachments, modify the routing list of the mas-
 ter copy, and/or add an electronic signature. Recipients can save their
 copies in their own personal File Cabinets. The master copy gets up-
 dated throughout the lifecycle of the routing package.

 User Roles and Policies

 During the lifecycle of a routing package, all participants play one
 or more specified roles. For example, a user may be an approver at one
 step and a carbon copy (cc:) recipient at another step. Roles are as-
 signed by the routing package initiator or template designer. Roles
 are defined by a set of rights (what a user can do), requests (what
 a user should do), and optionally, the name of an application to in-
 voke.

 Routing Package Tracking

 Tracking can be requested for any routing package stored in a user's
 File Cabinet. When tracking is requested, the Server sends a new car-
 bon copy of the master in its current state.

 A routing package's history is used to monitor its progress. The events
 logged in the routing package history include: when signatures are ap-
 plied, if the application was run, when routing copies were sent, and
 when updates were applied.

 Routing




                                  3

 

 Routing is defined by a routing list. The Server sends routing pack-
 ages according to the position of the recipients on the routing list.
 It updates the master when it receives a revised copy from a recip-
 ient, and then sends a new copy to the next recipient on the list.

 The routing list is created by the routing package initiator or the
 template designer. However, the path a routing package takes during
 its lifecycle may differ from the one specified in the original rout-
 ing list because someone along the way may modify it. Serial and carbon-
 copy parallel routing are both available.

 Attachments

 An attachment is any additional file or document that is routed with
 the master routing package. When a file or document is attached, the
 Server marks that attachment with the name of the user adding the at-
 tachment, an attachment ID, the date and time of addition, a user-provided
 subject label, and attachment data type. The date and time of addi-
 tion is the local date and time. Signatures

 Signatures is a password-protected function that indicates approval,
 disapproval, or acknowledgment of a routing package. If an attachment
 is subsequently removed or a key field value altered, the signature
 becomes invalid.

 When users sign a routing package, TeamRoute adds their name, the date
 and time, any added remarks, and the approval action. Recipients view-
 ing signatures are shown whether the signature remains valid.

 Help

 Users can get help for TeamRoute by using the Help facility. Help pro-
 vides basic information on how to perform the function in question with-
 out the user having to reference the documentation.

 Printing

 TeamRoute takes advantage of the printing facilities provided by ALL-IN-1
 MAIL. The user can specify the printer destination and options.

 Editing

                                  4

 

 TeamRoute allows users to specify their editor of choice supported by
 ALL-IN-1 MAIL.

 System Management

 TeamRoute for VMS provides a separate management utility. Invoking these
 utilities allows cluster-wide system management operations to be man-
 aged centrally.

 There are no special utilities to run for File Cabinet maintenance.
 User areas can be backed up or restored using standard VMS utilities.

 Documentation

 Documentation of the installation, system management, programming, and
 user procedures is included with the individual kits.
