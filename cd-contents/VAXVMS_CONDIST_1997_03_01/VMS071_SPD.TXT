PRODUCT NAME:  OpenVMS Operating System for Alpha and VAX, Version 7.1
SPD's 25.01.49

Note:

This SPD describes OpenVMS operating system software for the Alpha and
VAX computer family. Except where explicitly noted, the features de-
scribed in this SPD apply equally to Alpha and VAX systems. OpenVMS
Alpha and OpenVMS VAX operating system licenses and part numbers are
architecture specific. Please refer to the Ordering Information sec-
tion of this SPD for further details.

DESCRIPTION

OpenVMS is a general-purpose, multiuser operating system that runs in
both production and development environments. OpenVMS Alpha supports
Digital Equipment Corporation's Alpha series computers, while OpenVMS
VAX supports VAX, MicroVAX, VAXstation, and VAXserver series comput-
ers. OpenVMS software supports industry standards, facilitating ap-
plication portability and interoperability. OpenVMS provides symmet-
ric multiprocessing (SMP) support for multiprocessing Alpha and VAX
systems.

The OpenVMS operating system can be tuned to perform well in a wide
variety of environments. This includes combinations of compute-intensive,
I/O-intensive, client/server, real-time, and other environments. Ac-
tual system performance depends on the type of computer, available phys-
ical memory, and the number and type of active disk and tape drives.

The OpenVMS operating system has well-integrated networking, distributed
computing, client/server, multiprocessing, and windowing capabilities.
It contains extensive features that promote ease-of-use, improve the
productivity of programmers, and facilitate system management.

OpenVMS Alpha Version 7.1 and OpenVMS VAX Version 7.1 are functional
releases of the OpenVMS operating system for Digital's Alpha and VAX
systems respectively. OpenVMS Version 7.1 builds on the major tech-
nological enhancements made in OpenVMS Version 7.0 where OpenVMS Al-
pha was extended to support 64-bit virtual addressing.

OpenVMS Version 7.1 provides new features specifically designed to im-
prove performance and expand OpenVMS Cluster configuration flexibil-
ity. In addition, OpenVMS Alpha and VAX Version 7.1 provide numerous
enhancements and new features focused on connecting OpenVMS with the
Internet, extending the Very Large Memory (VLM) capabilities intro-
duced in OpenVMS Alpha Version 7.0, and making system management of
OpenVMS systems easier.

OpenVMS is an open software environment that supports key standards
such as OSF/Motif, POSIX, XPG4, and the OSF Distributed Computing En-
vironment (DCE). The right to use POSIX for OpenVMS and the DCE Run-
time Services for OpenVMS is bundled with the OpenVMS operating sys-
tem base license. DECwindows Motif is available exclusively as a sep-
arate layered product.

Refer to the OpenVMS Version 7.1 New Features Manual for further de-
tails on the new enhancements, features, and functions.

USER ENVIRONMENT

Users can access the OpenVMS software by using the English-like DIG-
ITAL Command Language (DCL), the command language for OpenVMS that is
supplied with the system. DCL commands provide information about the
system and initiate system utilities and user programs. DCL commands
take the form of a command name followed by parameters and qualifiers.
With the Digital DCL command PIPE, individual DCL operations can be
connected using a UNIX like command syntax. OpenVMS prompts users to
enter required DCL parameters, making it easy for novice users.

Users can enter DCL commands at a terminal or include them in command
procedures. These command procedures can be run interactively or sub-
mitted to a batch queue for later processing.


                                 2

 

Information on DCL and OpenVMS utilities is available on line through
the OpenVMS Help system. Online help includes summary information on
all aspects of system operation.

The following tools and utilities are integrated into the OpenVMS op-
erating system.

Text Processing

The Extensible Versatile Editor (EVE), one of several text editors sup-
plied by Digital, is the default editor for OpenVMS. EVE allows users
to insert, change, and delete text quickly. Written in the Digital Text
Processing Utility (DECTPU) language, EVE is a full-screen editor that
allows users to scroll through text on a terminal screen. EVE provides
an EDT style keypad, allowing EDT users to move easily to EVE. EDT is
also supported on OpenVMS Alpha Version 7.1 and OpenVMS VAX Version
7.1.

Mail Utility

The Mail utility allows users to send messages to any other user on
the system. Multinode operation is available if a DECnet or TCP/IP prod-
uct is installed and licensed on each participating node on the net-
work.

Command-Level Programming

Command-level programming allows users to create special files, called
command procedures, that contain a series of DCL commands. When users
execute a command procedure, the system processes the commands in the
command procedure consecutively. Users can also use special DCL com-
mands to:

o  Assign symbolic names

o  Evaluate numerical and logical expressions

o  Accept parameters

o  Communicate interactively with the user invoking the command pro-
   cedure

                                 3

 

o  Perform conditional (IF-THEN-ELSE) and branching (GOTO) logic

o  Handle error conditions

User Environment Tailoring

Users can customize the computing environment with login command pro-
cedures, shorthand commands, binding of commands to function keys, and
command recall and editing.

Terminal Fallback Facility (TFF)

This facility allows Digital 7-bit terminals to input and output the
Digital Multinational character set (MCS). Specific tables allow con-
version for a number of different 7-bit National Replacement Charac-
ter sets to MCS, such as French, German, Spanish, and Swedish. TFF also
allows character composition on terminals that do not have the com-
pose key.

National Character Set (NCS) Utility

This utility allows users to define non-ASCII string collating sequences
and to define conversion functions. Conversion functions use conver-
sion algorithms to change an input string; for example, to change low-
ercase characters to uppercase. NCS also allows OpenVMS Record Man-
agement Services (RMS) indexed files to be collated using user-specified
collating
sequences.

PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT

OpenVMS includes a comprehensive set of tools for developing programs,
including: run-time libraries (RTLs), a linker, a librarian, and a sym-
bolic debugger. The assembly-level VAX MACRO-32 language is supplied
with OpenVMS VAX. The following tools are available to the OpenVMS pro-
grammer.

Language and Run-Time Library Support


                                 4

 

OpenVMS includes several RTLs that provide:

o  String manipulation

o  Parallel processing support

o  I/O routines

o  I/O conversion

o  Terminal-independent screen handling

o  Date and time formatting routines

o  Highly accurate mathematical functions

o  Signaling and condition handling

o  Other general-purpose functions

With OpenVMS VAX, these routines can be called from programs written
in such languages as VAX MACRO-32, VAX Ada, VAX BASIC, VAX BLISS-32
Implementation Language, VAX C, DEC C, DEC C++, VAX COBOL, VAX DIBOL,
DEC Fortran, VAX Pascal, and VAX PL/I.

With OpenVMS Alpha, these routines can be called from programs writ-
ten in such languages as MACRO-64, DEC Ada, DEC BASIC, DEC C, DEC C++,
DEC COBOL, DEC Fortran, DEC Pascal, and DEC PL/I.

Also included in OpenVMS Alpha are language-support libraries. While
each language is different, all provide support for sequential file
I/O, and most support direct and indexed file I/O. Language RTLs also
provide support for I/O formatting, error handling, and in DEC For-
tran, the ability to read unformatted files that contain data from other
vendors.

RTLs are provided to support translated images created from user-mode
images built on OpenVMS VAX Version 4.0 through Version 5.5-2. Depend-
ing on the method used to create the VAX image, these RTLs can be use-
ful for images built on later versions of OpenVMS VAX, which do not
use features that were developed since OpenVMS VAX Version 5.5-2.

                                 5

 

Translated image RTLs are used to support a few architectural features
that differ between VAX and Alpha systems, such as VAX D-float and H-
float. They also support programs converted to run on Alpha systems
before native Alpha compilers were available for particular program-
ming languages.

Many Digital languages adhere to the common calling standard. This means
that routines written in any of these languages can directly call rou-
tines written in any other language. Development of applications us-
ing multiple languages is simple and straightforward.

All user accessible routines in the RTLs follow the OpenVMS Alpha or
OpenVMS VAX calling standard and condition-handling conventions, and
most are contained within shareable images.

At a lower level, programs can call system services directly for se-
curity, event flag, asynchronous system trap, logical name, record and
file I/O, process control, timer, time conversion, condition handling,
lock management, and memory management. Again, system services use the
OpenVMS VAX or OpenVMS Alpha calling standard and condition-handling
conventions.

OpenVMS supports the execution of user-mode images created on earlier
versions of OpenVMS. Typically, recompiling and relinking are not re-
quired.

MACRO Compiler (Alpha Only)

For migration purposes, the MACRO compiler is supplied with the Open-
VMS Alpha software.

DECthreads

OpenVMS includes a user-mode, multithreading capability called DEC-
threads. DECthreads provides a POSIX 1003.1C-1995 standard style in-
terface. Additionally, DECthreads provides an interface that is the
OpenVMS implementation of Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) threads
as defined by the Open Software Foundation (OSF).


                                 6

 

DECthreads is a library of run-time routines that allows the user to
create multiple threads of execution within a single address space.
With DECthreads Kernel Threads features enabled, Threads provide for
concurrent processing over all CPUs in a multiprocessor system by al-
lowing a multithreaded application to have a thread executing on ev-
ery CPU. Multithreading allows computation activity to overlap I/O ac-
tivity. Synchronization elements, such as mutexes and condition vari-
ables, are provided to help ensure that shared resources are accessed
correctly. For scheduling and prioritizing threads, DECthreads pro-
vides multiple scheduling policies. For debugging multithreaded ap-
plications, DECthreads is supported by the OpenVMS Debugger. DECthreads
also provides Thread Independent Services (TIS), which assist in the
development of thread-safe APIs.

Librarian Utility

The Librarian utility permits storage of object modules, image files,
macros, help text, or any general record-oriented information in cen-
tral, easily accessible files. Object module and image file libraries
are searched by the linker when the linker finds a reference it can-
not resolve in one of its input files. Alpha macro libraries are searched
by the MACRO-32 compiler and MACRO-64 assembler when either finds a
macro name that is not defined in the input file. VAX macro libraries
are searched by the assembler when the assembler finds a macro that
is not defined in the input file.

Hypersort

Hypersort is a portable library of user-callable routines that pro-
vide a high-performance sorting capability for Alpha systems

Traceback Facility

When an application is compiled and linked with traceback information,
the Traceback facility translates memory addresses into routine names
and line numbers and displays a symbolic traceback whenever a runtime
error occurs in that application.

Debugger

                                 7

 

The OpenVMS Debugger allows users to trace program execution, as well
as display and modify register contents using the same symbols that
are present in the source code.

The debugger contains a Heap Analyzer feature that allows you to graph-
ically view memory allocations and deallocations in real time.

Alpha System-Code Debugger

The OpenVMS Alpha System-Code Debugger is a kernel code debugger. It
allows a system code developer to trace the execution of nonpageable
system code at any Interrupt Priority Level (IPL). Based on the OpenVMS
Alpha Debugger, the system-code debugger uses the same interface and
most of the same command set.

System Dump Analyzer (SDA) Utility

In the event of a system failure, OpenVMS writes the contents of mem-
ory to a preallocated dump file. This dump file can later be analyzed
using SDA. System dumps can either be full memory dumps, where all mem-
ory is written, or selective memory dumps, where only memory in use
at the time of the system failure is written. Full memory dumps re-
quire a dump file big enough to hold all memory. Selective memory dumps
write as much of the memory in use at the time of the system failure
that will fit into the dump file. Therefore, this file is often much
smaller in size. The dump file can be located on any locally connected
disk. Dump compression allows both full and selective dumps to be writ-
ten to smaller files than required for uncompressed dumps.

RMS File Utilities

RMS file utilities allow users to analyze the internal structure of
an RMS file and to determine the most appropriate set of parameters
for the file. The RMS file utilities can also be used to create, load,
and reclaim space in an RMS file. Refer to the Operating System En-
vironment section of this SPD for more information on RMS.

File Differences Utility

This utility compares the contents of two files and lists those records
that do not match.

                                 8

 

Translated Image Environment (TIE) (Alpha Only)

OpenVMS Alpha provides an array of services that allow the operation
of programs which have undergone binary translation from OpenVMS VAX
images. These programs perform virtually all user-mode functions on
OpenVMS Alpha and operate in combination with other programs (images)
that have been translated from OpenVMS VAX or have been built using
native compilers on OpenVMS Alpha. Without requiring special source
code, the TIE resolves differences between the VAX and Alpha archi-
tectures, including floating-point registers, condition codes, excep-
tion handling, and ASTs.

The TIE included with OpenVMS Alpha can run images that have been trans-
lated elsewhere. The DECmigrate for OpenVMS Alpha layered product can
be used to translate user-mode images from OpenVMS VAX. For additional
information on the characteristics of programs suitable for binary trans-
lation, refer to the DECmigrate for OpenVMS AXP Systems Software Prod-
uct Description (SPD 39.44.xx)).

SYSTEM MANAGEMENT ENVIRONMENT

OpenVMS provides a variety of features that aid the system manager in
configuring and maintaining an optimal system. The following features
are available to system managers.

OpenVMS Management Station Version 2.1

The OpenVMS Management Station is a Windows PC-based tool that allows
management of one or more OpenVMS Cluster systems from a single point
of control. For user account management, the Management Station sup-
ports account creation, modification, and deletion, as well as renam-
ing accounts and displaying account attributes. The OpenVMS Manage-
ment Station makes it possible to easily modify many accounts in a sin-
gle operation. It provides a comprehensive interface to the user ac-
count management features.





                                 9

 

Version 2.1 adds functionality for printer and queue management. Sys-
tem managers can now manage all the printers, print queues, and jobs
in their environment via a centralized Windows GUI. This includes per-
forming such tasks as monitoring one or more printers, adding and re-
moving printers and their associated queues, examining and modifying
queue and printer attributes, and requeuing or deleting jobs. In ad-
dition, printer configuration information can be stored in a perma-
nent database to ensure that the printer configuration is recreated
easily and accurately at reboot.

With this release, the system manager can perform OpenVMS user account
and printer management from any MS-Windows based client (including Win-
dows NT and Windows 95), using a single set of Windows 95 style property-
tab dialogs. Both DECnet and/or TCP/IP transports are supported on client
and server. In addition, the PATHWORKS client is no longer required.

Restrictions:

o  Managing OpenVMS Cluster members as individual nodes is not sup-
   ported. OpenVMS Cluster systems are treated as indivisible enti-
   ties; an operation cannot be performed on specific cluster members.

o  OpenVMS Cluster systems with multiple UAFs are not supported.

o  PCs currently support TCP/IP and DECnet Phase IV only.

o  OpenVMS VAX Version 6.1 requires a remedial kit (VAXCXXL01 061) to
   operate correctly.

o  Additional TCP/IP stacks for OpenVMS have not been tested. However,
   TCP/IP stacks that are 100% compliant with the QIO interface for
   Digital TCP/IP Servers for OpenVMS should also work. Contact your
   TCP/IP vendor for additional information and support issues.

DECamds

DECamds Version 7.1 is available on the OpenVMS distribution kit. DE-
Camds is a separately installable, real-time, high-performance, mul-
tisystem monitoring utility. It is supported on any system running Open-
VMS Version 7.1. With OpenVMS Version 7.1, the right to use DECamds
is included under the terms and conditions of the OpenVMS operating
system base license (both Alpha and VAX).

                                11

 

DECamds provides system resource monitoring, investigation aid, and
correction capability. This enables system managers to proactively and
effectively manage multiple systems from a centralized DECwindows dis-
play.

The DECamds software includes an OpenVMS device driver, which runs on
every node that is monitored. It also includes console software, which
runs on the centralized X Window monitoring station.

Batch and Print Queuing System

OpenVMS provides an extensive batch and print capability that allows
the creation of queues and the setup of spooled devices to process non-
interactive workloads in parallel with timesharing or real-time jobs.

The OpenVMS batch and print operations support two types of queues:
generic queues and execution queues. A generic queue is an interme-
diate queue that holds a job until an appropriate execution queue be-
comes available to initiate the job. An execution queue is a queue through
which the job (either print or batch) is actually processed.

The system queues batch jobs for execution. The system manager can reg-
ulate the number of queues and the number of streams per queue (the
number of batch jobs in the queue that can execute concurrently).

Both generic and execution batch queues can have different attributes,
such as the maximum CPU time permitted, working set size, and prior-
ity. Facilities are provided for starting and stopping queues and for
starting and stopping jobs in a queue. Because multiple execution queues
can be associated with a generic queue, OpenVMS VAX enables load bal-
ancing across available CPUs in an OpenVMS Cluster system, increas-
ing overall system throughput.

Print queues, both generic and execution, together with queue manage-
ment facilities, provide versatile print capabilities, including sup-
port of ANSI and PostScript file printing.

The maximum number of process identifiers for queuing requests is 1024.

Accounting Utility

                                12

 

For accounting purposes, OpenVMS keeps records of system resource us-
age. These statistics include processor and memory utilization, I/O
counts, print symbiont line counts, image activation counts, and pro-
cess termination records. The OpenVMS Accounting utility allows you
to generate various reports using this data.

Audit Analysis Utility

For security auditing purposes, OpenVMS selectively records critical,
security-relevant events in the system security audit log file. These
records contain the date and time the event occurred, the identity of
the associated user process, and information specific to each event
type. This information helps the system manager maintain system se-
curity and deter possible intruders. The OpenVMS Audit Analysis util-
ity allows you to generate various reports from this data.

Autoconfigure/AUTOGEN Utilities

The Autoconfigure and AUTOGEN utilities automatically configure the
available devices in the system tables and set system parameters based
on the peripheral and memory architecture. This eliminates the need
for a traditional system generation process when the hardware config-
uration is expanded or otherwise modified.

The OpenVMS AUTOGEN command procedure sets several system parameters
automatically by detecting the devices installed in a configuration.
A feedback option allows you to generate a report of recommended pa-
rameter settings based on previous usage patterns.

Backup Utility

The Backup utility provides full-volume and incremental file backups
for file-structured, mounted volumes and volume sets. Individual files,
selected directory structures, or all files on a volume set can be backed
up and restored. Files can be selected by various dates (such as cre-
ation or modification) and can be backed up to magnetic tape, magnetic
disk, or Write Once Read Many (WORM) optical disk. The Backup util-
ity can also be used to restore a save set or list the contents of a
save set.

                                13

 

A BACKUP API has been added for invoking backup routines from an ex-
ecutable procedure.

The Backup Manager for OpenVMS provides a screen-oriented interface
to the Backup utility that assists users in performing routine backup
operations. The Backup Manager is menu driven and provides:

o  Access to the save, restore, and list operations without having to
   understand Backup command syntax

o  The ability to create, modify, recall, and delete Backup Manager
   templates that describe the Backup save operations

The Backup Manager works on all supported OpenVMS configurations with
a video terminal. It uses the Screen Management (SMG) RTL routines to
provide a window-like user interface. The software does not assume any
privilege on the part of its user beyond access to the files and de-
vices being operated upon.

Standalone BACKUP Utility (VAX Only)

Standalone BACKUP provides a mechanism for system managers to back up
and restore system disks. This utility can also be used during the in-
stallation of the OpenVMS VAX operating system.

Analyze Disk Structure Utility

The Analyze Disk Structure utility compares the structure information
on a disk volume with the contents of the disk, prints the structure
information, and permits changes to that information. It also can be
used to repair errors that are detected in the file structure of disks.

Monitor Utility

The Monitor utility enables the system manager to monitor different
classes of systemwide performance data including: process activity,
I/O activity, memory management activity, vector processing activity
(VAX only), and two-phase commit transaction activity at specified in-
tervals. The data can be displayed as it is gathered or saved in a file
for later use.

                                14

 

License Management Facility (LMF)

The License Management facility allows the system manager to enable
software licenses and to determine which software products are licensed
on an OpenVMS system.

System Management Utility (SYSMAN)

The System Management utility allows system managers to define a man-
agement environment in which operations performed from the local Open-
VMS system can be executed on all other OpenVMS systems in the envi-
ronment. The environment can include OpenVMS Alpha and VAX systems con-
figured in an OpenVMS Cluster or multiple systems networked through
DECnet or DECnet-Plus.

Operations

OpenVMS allows for varying levels of privilege to be assigned to dif-
ferent operators. Operators can use the OpenVMS Help Message utility
to receive online descriptions of error messages. In addition, system-
generated messages can be routed to different terminals based on their
interest to the console operators, tape librarians, security admin-
istrators, and system managers.

Security

External Authentication

External authentication is an optional feature introduced in OpenVMS
Version 7.1 that enables OpenVMS systems to authenticate designated
users within a LAN Manager domain using their LAN Manager user name
and password.

Users who are externally authenticated by their LAN Manager need only
remember a single user name/password combination to gain access to their
OpenVMS and LAN Manager accounts. In addition, the OpenVMS DCL com-
mand SET PASSWORD has been enhanced to update the user's password in
the LAN Manager domain database (as well as optionally synchronize the
SYSUAF password).

                                15

 

For externally authenticated users, the normal system authorization
database (SYSUAF.DAT) is used to construct the OpenVMS process pro-
file (UIC, privileges, quotas, and so on) and to apply specific lo-
gin restrictions. However, there are two key differences between ex-
ternally authenticated users and normal OpenVMS users. For externally
authenticated users:

o  The password stored in the SYSUAF is not the password used to ver-
   ify the user at login time.

o  The SYSUAF user name selected to be used for OpenVMS process iden-
   tification may not be the same as the LAN Manager user name that
   was used to authenticate the user at login. The system manager spec-
   ifies the LAN Manager to OpenVMS user name mapping for each user.

Minimum requirements:

o  PATHWORKS Version 5.0E for OpenVMS, operating as a LAN Manager do-
   main member, backup domain controller, or primary domain controller

o  DECwindows Version 1.2-4

Security APIs

With OpenVMS Version 6.2, security APIs for intrusion detection, proxy
access, and impersonation services were added on both the Alpha and
VAX platforms to provide better security in client/server applications.

OpenVMS provides a rich set of tools to control user access to system-
controlled data structures and devices that store information. Open-
VMS employs a reference monitor concept that mediates all access at-
tempts between subjects (such as user processes) and security-relevant
system objects (such as files). OpenVMS also provides a system secu-
rity audit log file that records the results of all object access at-
tempts. The audit log can also be used to capture information regard-
ing a wide variety of other security-relevant events.

The system manager maintains user account information in the system
user authorization file (SYSUAF). When creating user accounts with the
Authorize utility, the system manager assigns the privileges and quo-
tas associated with each user account. The system manager also assigns
a user name, password, and unique user identification code (UIC) to
each account. Additional identifiers can be assigned to each account,
allowing users to belong to multiple overlapping groups or projects.
The system manager can limit account use by the time of day, day of
week, and type of access, such as local, remote, network, or batch.

                                17

 

To log in and gain access to the system, the user must supply a valid
user name and password. The password is encoded and does not appear
on terminal displays. Users can change their password voluntarily, or
the system manager can specify how frequently passwords change, along
with minimum password length, and the use of randomly generated pass-
words.

OpenVMS provides a password dictionary filter that screens password
choices for common words, and a user password history filter that pre-
vents users from reusing passwords that they have used within the past
year. In addition to these built-in filters, a site can design and in-
stall its own filter to screen passwords according to a site-specific
password policy.

The system password hash algorithm can also be replaced with a pri-
vate algorithm for those sites that have contractual obligations to
use specific public or private password encryption algorithms. The sys-
tem manager can enable this feature on a per-user, per-password ba-
sis.

Login security includes break-in detection, which disables terminals
when password guessing is detected. Users retain a secure login path,
which can thwart Trojan horse attacks against local terminals. Addi-
tionally, the system manager can associate a system password with dial-
in terminal lines to prevent the display of any operating system-specific
identification that might yield clues to possible attack methods. When
a user logs in, the system displays a message stating when the last
login for the account occurred and the number of failed attempts since
the last successful login.

Every security-relevant system object is labeled with the UIC of its
owner along with a simple protection mask. The owner UIC consists of
two fields, the user field and a group field. System objects also have
a protection mask that allows read, write, execute, and delete access
to the object's owner, group, privileged system users, and to all other
users. The system manager can protect system objects with access con-
trol lists (ACLs) that allow access to be granted or denied to a list
of individual users, groups, or identifiers. ACLs can also be used to
audit access attempts to critical system objects.

                                18

 

OpenVMS applies full protection to the following system objects:

o  Capabilities (VAX only)

o  Common event flag clusters

o  Devices

o  Files

o  Group global sections

o  Logical name tables

o  Batch/print queues

o  Resource domains

o  Security classes

o  System global sections

o  Volumes (ODS-2)

o  Spiralog volumes

OpenVMS provides security attribute defaults in the form of security
profile templates. These templates are referenced whenever a new ob-
ject is created and provide a means of associating default security
information with each system object class, except for files. Protec-
tion information for files is inherited from the previous version of
an existing file, the parent directory, or the default protection of
the creating process.

Data scavenging protection can be enabled in the form of high-water
marking and erase-on-delete attributes. These attributes ensure that
the contents of a file cannot be read after the file has been deleted.
The system manager can enforce file erasure on a per-volume basis. The
system manager can also replace the disk erasure pattern with a pri-
vate pattern for those sites that have contractual obligations to use
a specific pattern.

                                19

 

Security auditing is provided for the selective recording of security-
related events. This auditing information can be directed to security
operator terminals (alarms) or to the system security audit log file
(audits). Each audit record contains the date and time of the event,
the identity of the associated user process, and additional informa-
tion specific to each event.

OpenVMS provides security auditing for the following events:

o  Login and logout

o  Login failures and break-in attempts

o  Object creation, access, deaccess, and deletion; selectable by use
   of privilege, type of access, and on individual objects

o  Authorization database changes

o  Network logical link connections for DECnet for OpenVMS, DECnet-
   Plus, DECwindows, IPC, and SYSMAN

o  Use of identifiers as privileges

o  Installed image additions, deletions, and replacements

o  Volume mounts and dismounts

o  Use of the Network Control Program (NCP) utility

o  Use or failed use of individual privileges

o  Use of individual process control system services

o  System parameter changes

o  System time changes and recalibrations

Note: Because no system can provide complete security, Digital cannot
guarantee complete system security. However, Digital continually strives
to enhance the security capabilities of its products. Customers are
strongly advised to follow all industry-recognized security practices.

OPERATING SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT

OpenVMS VAX Processes and Scheduling

The basic unit of execution in OpenVMS is the process. A process con-
sists of individual address space and registers known as context, and
code called an executable image. The context identifies the process
and describes its current state. Executable images consist of system
programs and user programs that have been compiled and linked.

The maximum number of concurrent processes is 8,192 per OpenVMS VAX
system.

Processes receive time to execute their images based on the priority.
Thirty-two priorities are recognized on OpenVMS VAX, and 64 priori-
ties are recognized on OpenVMS Alpha. Priorities 0 to 15 are for time-
sharing processes and applications that are not time critical (four
is the typical default for timesharing processes). Priorities 16 to
32 on VAX and 16 to 63 on Alpha are for real-time processes.

Each time an event such as an I/O interrupt occurs, the system ser-
vices the event first and then passes control to the highest prior-
ity process ready to execute. The system automatically adjusts the pri-
orities of processes in the range of 0 to 15 to favor I/O-bound and
interactive processes. However, the system does not adjust the pri-
ority of a process in the range of 16 to 31 for VAX or 16 to 63 for
Alpha.

Real-time processes can be assigned higher priorities to ensure that
they receive processor time whenever they are ready to execute. Real-
time processes are scheduled preemptively; that is, if a real-time pro-
cess is ready to execute, it is given to the processor immediately,
unless a process with a higher priority is ready to execute.

OpenVMS uses paging and swapping to provide sufficient virtual mem-
ory for concurrently executing processes. Also, paging and swapping
are provided for processes whose memory requirements exceed available
physical memory. The maximum working set size is 512 MB of memory for
VAX and 4 GB for Alpha.

                                21

 

Programmers can control memory management from within an image. An im-
age executing in a real-time process, for example, can inhibit pag-
ing or swapping of critical code and data.

Peripheral devices can be managed by the system or allocated by in-
dividual processes. At least one disk must be a system disk. Other disks
can be designated as data disks for the general use of all users log-
ging in to the system or for a specific group of users. The system con-
trols interactive terminals and one or more printers.

OpenVMS Alpha Processes and Scheduling

The basic unit of execution in OpenVMS Alpha is the kernel thread. A
kernel thread consists of individual address space and registers known
as context, and code called an executable image. The context identi-
fies the kernel thread and describes its current state. Each process
can have up to 16 kernel threads. Executable images consist of sys-
tem programs and user programs that have been compiled and linked.

The maximum number of concurrent processes is 16,384 per OpenVMS Al-
pha system.

Kernel threads receive processor time to execute their images based
on the priority of the process. Thirty-two priorities are recognized
on OpenVMS VAX, and 64 priorities are recognized on OpenVMS Alpha. Pri-
orities 0 to 15 are for time-sharing processes and applications that
are not time critical (four is the typical default for timesharing pro-
cesses). Priorities 16 to 32 on VAX and 16 to 63 on Alpha are for real-
time processes.

Each time an event such as an I/O interrupt occurs, the system first
services the event and then passes control to the highest priority ker-
nel thread ready to execute. The system adjusts the priorities of ker-
nel threads whose base priority is in the range of 0 to 15 to favor
I/O-bound and interactive processes. However, the system does not ad-
just the priority of a kernel thread in the range of 16 to 31 for VAX
or 16 to 63 for Alpha.



                                22

 

Real-time processes can be assigned higher priorities to ensure that
they receive processor time whenever they are ready to execute. Real-
time processes are scheduled preemptively; that is, if a real-time pro-
cess is ready to execute, it is given to the processor immediately,
unless a higher priority process is ready to execute.

OpenVMS uses paging and swapping to provide sufficient virtual mem-
ory for concurrently executing processes. Also, paging and swapping
is provided for processes whose memory requirements exceed available
physical memory.

Programmers can control memory management from within an image. An im-
age executing in a real-time process, for example, can inhibit pag-
ing or swapping of critical code and data.

Peripheral devices can be managed by the system or allocated by in-
dividual processes. At least one disk must be a system disk. Other disks
can be designated as data disks for the general use of all users log-
ging in to the system or for a specific group of users. The system con-
trols interactive terminals and one or more printers.

64-Bit Virtual Addressing (Alpha Only)

The OpenVMS Alpha operating system provides support for 64-bit vir-
tual memory addressing. This capability makes the 8TB virtual address
space, defined by the Alpha architecture, available to the OpenVMS Al-
pha operating system and to application programs. Future hardware im-
plementations will provide greater capacity. OpenVMS Alpha compilers
and applications take advantage of 64-bit processing by using 64-bit
data types. Refer to the SPDs for the OpenVMS Alpha compilers for fur-
ther details. Note the application-virtual address space defaults to
a 32-bit implementation for compatability and migration purposes.

Very Large Memory (VLM) Features (Alpha Only)

OpenVMS Alpha Version 7.1 builds on the Version 7.0 VLM support and
provides the following extended, additional memory management VLM fea-
tures:

o  Memory-resident global sections

                                23

 

o  Shared page tables

o  Expandable global page table

o  Reserved memory registry

Memory-resident global sections allow a database server to keep larger
amounts of "hot" data cached in physical memory. The database server
then accesses the data directly from physical memory without perform-
ing I/O read operations from the database files on disk. With faster
access to the data in physical memory, run-time performance increases
dramatically.

Shared page tables allow that same database server to reduce the amount
of physical memory consumed within the system. Because multiple server
processes share the same physical page tables that map the large database
cache, an OpenVMS Alpha system can support more server processes. This
increases overall system capacity and decreases response time to client
requests.

Also, with shared page tables, the database server startup time is dra-
matically reduced because server processes can map memory-resident global
sections hundreds of times faster than traditional global sections.
With a multiple giga-byte global database cache, the server startup
performance gains can be significant.

As of OpenVMS Alpha Version 7.1, the system parameters GBLPAGES and
GBLPAGFIL have been modified to become dynamic parameters. Users with
the CMKRNL privilege can now change these parameter values on a run-
ning system. Increasing the value of the GBLPAGES parameter will al-
low the global page table to expand, on demand, up to the new maxi-
mum size.

The Reserved Memory Registry supports memory-resident global sections
and shared page tables. Through its interface within the SYSMAN util-
ity, the Reserved Memory Registry allows an OpenVMS system to be con-
figured with large amounts of memory set aside for use within memory-
resident sections or other privileged code. The Reserved Memory Reg-
istry also allows an OpenVMS system to be properly tuned through AU-
TOGEN, thus accounting for the pre-allocated reserved memory.

                                24

 

Extended Physical Addressing (VAX Only)

With OpenVMS VAX Version 6.0, physical address space was extended from
30 bits to 32 bits. The OpenVMS VAX operating system can provide 3.5
GB of physical memory and .5 GB of I/O and adapter space. This enables
large applications and workloads to access the large amounts of phys-
ical memory that they require. The following table lists the VAX pro-
cessors that support this extended physical addressing.

Vector Processing (VAX Only)

A single data item with only one value is known as a scalar value. A
group of related scalar values, or elements, with the same data type,
is known as a vector.

An extension to the VAX architecture defines an optional design for
integrated vector processing that has been adopted by several VAX sys-
tems. The VAX vector architecture includes sixteen 64-bit vector reg-
isters (V0 through V15), each containing 64 elements; vector control
registers; vector function units; and a set of vector instructions.
VAX vector instructions transfer data between the vector registers and
memory; perform integer and floating-point arithmetic; and execute pro-
cessor control functions.

A more detailed description of the VAX vector architecture, vector reg-
isters, and vector instructions appears in the VAX MACRO and Instruc-
tion Set Reference Manual.

                                25

 

The OpenVMS VAX operating system provides fully shared, multiprogram-
ming support for VAX vector processing systems. By default, OpenVMS
VAX loads vector support code when initializing vector-present sys-
tems but does not load it when initializing vector-absent systems. Sys-
tem managers can control this behavior by using the VECTOR_PROC sys-
tem parameter.

The presence of vector support code in a system has little effect on
processes running in a scalar-only system, or scalar processes run-
ning in a vector-present system. If many processes must compete si-
multaneously for vector processor resources, the system manager can
maintain good performance by adjusting system resources and process
quotas.

The OpenVMS VAX operating system makes the services of the vector pro-
cessor available to system users by means of a software abstract known
as a capability. A system manager can restrict the use of the vector
processor to users holding a particular identifier by associating an
ACL entry with the VECTOR object.

The VAX Vector Instruction Emulation Facility (VVIEF) is a standard
feature of the OpenVMS VAX operating system. It allows vectorized ap-
plications to be written and debugged in a VAX system in which vec-
tor processors are not available. VVIEF emulates the VAX vector pro-
cessing environment, including the nonprivileged VAX vector instruc-
tions and the OpenVMS VAX vector system services. Use of VVIEF is re-
stricted to code in user mode.

DECdtm Services

The DECdtm services embedded in the OpenVMS operating system support
fully distributed databases using a two-phase commit protocol. The DECdtm
services provide the technology and features for distributed process-
ing, ensuring both transaction and database integrity across multi-
ple Digital resource managers. Updates to distributed databases oc-
cur as a single all-or-nothing unit of work, regardless of where the
data physically resides. This ensures the consistency of distributed
data.


                                26

 

DECdtm services allow applications to define global transactions that
can include calls to any number of Digital data management products.
Regardless of the mix of data management products used, the global trans-
action either commits or stops. OpenVMS is unique in providing trans-
action processing functionality with base operating system services.

DECdtm features include:

o  Embedded OpenVMS system services that support the DECtp architec-
   ture, providing the features and technology for distributed trans-
   action processing.

o  The ability for multiple disjoint resources to be updated atomi-
   cally. These resources can be either physically disjointed (for ex-
   ample, on different CPUs) or logically disjointed (for example, in
   different databases on the same CPU).

o  Robust application development. Applications can be written to en-
   sure that data is never in an inconsistent state, even in the event
   of system failures.

o  Can be called using any Digital TP monitor or database product. This
   is useful for applications using several Digital database products.

Interprocess Communication

OpenVMS provides the following facilities for applications that con-
sist of multiple cooperating processes:

o  Mailboxes as virtual devices that allow processes to communicate
   with queued messages.

o  Shared memory sections on a single processor or an SMP system that
   permit multiple processes to access shared address space concur-
   rently.

o  Common event flags that provide simple synchronization.

o  A lock manager that provides a more comprehensive enqueue/dequeue
   facility with multilevel locks, values, and asynchronous system traps
   (ASTs).

Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP)

                                27

 

OpenVMS provides symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) support for Alpha and
VAX multiprocessor systems. SMP is a form of tightly coupled multi-
processing in which all processors perform operations simultaneously.
The processors can perform operations in all OpenVMS access modes, such
as user, supervisor, executive, and kernel.

OpenVMS SMP configurations consist of multiple CPUs executing code from
a single shared memory address space. Users and processes share a sin-
gle copy of OpenVMS Alpha or OpenVMS VAX address space. SMP also pro-
vides simultaneous shared access to common data in global sections to
all processors. OpenVMS SMP selects the CPU where a process will run
based on its priority.

SMP support is an integral part of OpenVMS and is provided to the user
transparently. Because an SMP system is a single system entity, it is
configured into a network and OpenVMS Cluster configurations as a sin-
gle node.

Networking Facilities

OpenVMS provides device drivers for all Digital local area network (LAN)
adapters listed in the LAN Options section of Appendix A of this SPD.
Application programmers can use the QIO system service to communicate
with other systems connected via the LAN using either Ethernet or In-
stitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineer (IEEE) 802.3 packet for-
mat. Simultaneous use of Digital Ethernet and the IEEE 802.3 proto-
cols are supported on any Digital LAN adapter.

OpenVMS supports the standards defined by the ATM Forum's LANE Ver-
sion 1.0 specifications for LAN emulation over an ATM network. By im-
plementing an emulated LAN over an ATM network, you enable a group of
ATM stations to act like a traditional LAN. LAN emulated over an ATM
network allows you to run your existing applications basically unchanged,
while the computers on which your applications are running are con-
nected to the ATM network.





                                28

 

OpenVMS implements the standards defined in RFC 1577 (Classical IP over
ATM). This implementation introduces the necessary system interface
for Classical IP (CLIP) over an ATM network, and enables CLIP and ARP
protocols in an ATM network environment to be configured as a logi-
cal IP subnetwork (LIS). Consult your IP product documentation for the
status of support of IP over this interface.

DECnet-Plus offers task-to-task communications, file management, down-
line system and task loading, network command terminals, and network
resource sharing capabilities as defined in the Digital Network Ar-
chitecture (DNA) Phase V protocols. DECnet-Plus provides the newest
DECnet features such as extended addressing and downline-load perfor-
mance enhancements. DECnet-Plus integrates DECnet and OSI protocols
and now provides a linkage to TCP/IP using Request for Comments (RFC)
1006 and RFC 1859. DECnet and OSI applications can now be run over DEC-
net (NSP), OSI (CLNS), and TCP/IP transports.

DECnet for OpenVMS VAX and Alpha offers the networking capabilities
as defined in the Digital Network Architecture (DNA) Phase IV. For more
information, refer to the DECnet-Plus and DECnet Software portion of
the Associated Products section of this SPD.

Terminal Server Products

Digital's terminal server products provide terminal server access to
OpenVMS. When used in an OpenVMS Cluster environment, terminal servers
distribute users across the available Alpha and VAX systems at login
time.

OpenVMS can also establish a connection to other devices (such as print-
ers) that are attached to such terminal servers.

Reliability

OpenVMS handles hardware errors as transparently as possible while main-
taining data integrity and providing sufficient information to diag-
nose errors. The system limits the effects of an error by first de-
termining if the error is fatal. If the error occurs in system con-
text, the current OpenVMS system shuts down. If the error is not fa-

                                29

 

tal, the system recovers actions pertinent to the error and contin-
ues the current operation.

In all cases, information relevant to the error is written to the er-
ror log file for later analysis. Hardware errors include the follow-
ing categories:

o  Processor errors. These include processor soft errors, processor
   hard errors, processor machine checks, and adapter errors.

o  Memory errors. These can be unrecoverable (hard) errors or recov-
   erable (soft) errors. The system examines memory at startup time
   and does not use any bad pages. During system operation, the sys-
   tem corrects all single-bit memory errors for those systems with
   error correction code (ECC) memory. On OpenVMS VAX, an unrecover-
   able error causes the memory page on which the error occurred to
   be added to the bad page list. If the page has not been modified,
   system operation continues with a new copy of the page.

o  Correctable memory errors. A primary cause of these correctable mem-
   ory errors is Alpha particle radiation. On some processors, when
   correctable memory errors occur, the memory controller corrects only
   the data returned to the CPU or I/O controller. The actual data in
   memory is left with the error intact. Subsequent read operations
   cause correction cycles to occur and, in most cases, an interrupt
   to report the error. On many of these processors, OpenVMS monitors
   the occurrence of correctable memory errors and, in almost all cases,
   is able to remove the error condition by rewriting the data in mem-
   ory. Rewriting the data causes the data to be corrected in that mem-
   ory location. On OpenVMS VAX, if the cause of the error is not tran-
   sient, and the error condition persists, the operating system at-
   tempts to move the data from the existing page, which contains the
   error, to a new page. The original page is then retired from use.

Other failures include:

o  Operating system errors (system-detected inconsistencies or archi-
   tectural errors in system context)

o  User errors

                                30

 

o  I/O errors

The system logs all processor errors, all operating system errors de-
tected through internal consistency checks, all double-bit memory er-
rors (and a summary of corrected single-bit memory errors), and most
I/O errors.

If the system is shut down because of an unrecoverable hardware or soft-
ware error, a dump of physical memory is written. The dump includes
the contents of the processor registers. The OpenVMS System Dump An-
alyzer (SDA) utility is provided for analyzing memory dumps.

Power Failures (VAX Only)

If the power fails, the system shuts down automatically. When power
is restored, the system restarts automatically and resumes process-
ing at the point of interruption under these circumstances:

o  If the system has a time-of-day clock and a memory battery backup
   unit

o  If the contents of memory are still valid

o  If the system is set to permit automatic rebooting

The system restarts devices and communications lines and all I/O op-
erations in progress, including magnetic tape I/O operations. On re-
quest, programs can be notified of power restoration. An optional battery-
operated hardware clock resets the date and time of day when the sys-
tem restarts. If the system does not have a battery backup unit, or
if the memory contents are not valid on power restoration, the sys-
tem reboots automatically if it is set to permit automatic rebooting.

If, for any reason, after a power failure the system disk does not come
back on line within a specific time after the CPU regains power, the
system shuts down.

Input/Output


                                31

 

The QIO system service and other related IO services provide a direct
interface to the operating system's I/O routines. These services are
available from within most OpenVMS programming languages and can be
used to perform low-level I/O operations efficiently with a minimal
amount of system overhead for time-critical applications.

Device drivers execute I/O instructions to transfer data to and from
a device and to communicate directly with an I/O device. Each type of
I/O device requires its own driver. Digital supplies drivers for all
devices supported by the OpenVMS operating system and provides QIO sys-
tem service routines to access the special features available in many
of these devices.

OpenVMS supports a variety of disk and tape peripheral devices, as well
as terminals, networks, and mailboxes (virtual devices for interpro-
cess communication), and more general I/O devices.

With OpenVMS Alpha, users can write drivers for I/O devices that do
not have inherent OpenVMS support. OpenVMS Alpha allows device drivers
to be written in DEC C and MACRO-32. Documentation is available that
describes how to write OpenVMS Alpha device drivers and how to con-
vert existing OpenVMS VAX drivers to run on OpenVMS Alpha systems. The
DEC C compiler for OpenVMS Alpha is an optional layered product.

With OpenVMS VAX, users can write their own drivers in MACRO-32 for
I/O devices that do not have inherent OpenVMS support, as described
in the appropriate documentation.

I/O Performance Features

Fast I/O provides a suite of additional system services that appli-
cations can use to improve I/O throughput. The fast I/O services min-
imize the CPU resources required to perform I/O.

Fast Path provides a streamlined mainline code path through the I/O
subsystem to improve both uniprocessor and multiprocessor I/O perfor-
mance. On multiprocessor systems, Fast Path allows all CPU process-
ing for specific I/O adapters to be handled by a specific CPU. This
can significantly lower the demands on the primary CPU and increase
the I/O throughput on multiprocessor systems with multiple I/O ports.

                                32

 

The CI port and DSA disk drivers have been enhanced to take advantage
of the Fast Path capability. No user application changes are needed
to take advantage of Fast Path. Fast Path can be utilized by the $QIO
system service or the Fast I/O services.

Virtual I/O Cache

OpenVMS provides a standalone or clusterwide, file-oriented disk cache.
Applications benefit from the advantages of the virtual I/O cache with-
out any special coding. The virtual I/O file-caching algorithm is cho-
sen based on the type of clusterwide access currently in progress. Vir-
tual I/O caching reduces current and potential I/O bottlenecks within
OpenVMS systems. It reduces the number of I/Os to the disk subsystem,
thereby reducing systemwide bottlenecks.

Record Management Services (RMS)

RMS is a set of I/O services that helps application programs to pro-
cess and manage files and records. Although it is intended to provide
a comprehensive software interface to mass storage devices, RMS also
supports device-independent access to unit-record devices.

RMS supports sequential, relative, and indexed file organizations in
fixed-length and variable-length record formats. RMS also supports byte
stream formats for sequential file organization.

RMS record access modes provide access to records in four ways:

o  Sequentially

o  Directly by key value

o  Directly by relative record number

o  Directly by record file address

RMS also supports block I/O operations for various performance-critical
applications that require user-defined file organizations and record
formats.

                                33

 

RMS promotes safe and efficient file sharing by providing multiple file
access modes, automatic record locking (where applicable), and optional
buffer sharing by multiple processes.

RMS utilities aid file creation and record maintenance. These util-
ities convert files from one organization and format to another; re-
structure indexed files for storage and access efficiency; and reclaim
data structures within indexed files. These utilities also generate
appropriate reports.

For systems that have DECnet for OpenVMS VAX and Alpha, or DECnet-Plus
installed, RMS provides a subset of file and record management ser-
vices to remote network nodes. Remote file operations are generally
transparent to user programs.

Commands such as EDIT, CREATE, COPY, TYPE, and PRINT allow users to
manipulate RMS records within RMS files at the DCL command level.

Disk and Tape Volumes

The system manager can organize disk volumes into volume sets. Vol-
ume sets can contain a mix of disk device types and can be extended
by adding volumes. Within a volume set, files of any organization type
can span multiple volumes. Files can be allocated to the set as a whole
(the default) or to specific volumes within the set. Optionally, the
system manager can allocate portions of indexed files to specific ar-
eas of a single disk or to specific volumes in a volume set.

The system manager can place quotas on a disk to control the amount
of space individual users can allocate. Quota assignment is made by
UIC and can be controlled for each individual volume set in the sys-
tem (or for each individual volume if the volume is not part of a set).

The system manager can cache disk structure information in memory to
reduce the I/O overhead required for file management services. Although
not required to do so, users can preallocate space and control auto-
matic allocation. For example, a file can be extended by a given num-
ber of blocks, contiguously or noncontiguously, for optimal file sys-

The system applies software validity checks and checksums to criti-
cal disk structure information. If a disk is improperly dismounted be-
cause of user error or system failure, the system rebuilds the disk's
structure information automatically the next time the disk is mounted.
The system detects bad blocks and prevents their reuse once the files
to which the blocks were allocated are deleted. On DIGITAL Storage Ar-
chitecture (DSA) disks, the disk controller detects and replaces bad
blocks automatically.

The system provides eight levels of named directories and subdirec-
tories whose contents are alphabetically ordered. Device and file spec-
ifications follow Digital conventions. Users can use logical names to
abbreviate the specifications and to make application programs device
and file name independent. Users can assign a logical name to an en-
tire specification, to a portion of a specification, or to another log-
ical name.

OpenVMS supports multivolume magnetic tape files with transparent vol-
ume switching. Access positioning is done either by file name or by
relative file position.

OpenVMS Cluster Software

OpenVMS Cluster software is available for Alpha and VAX systems as a
separately licensed System Integrated Product (SIP). It provides a highly
integrated OpenVMS computing environment that is distributed over mul-
tiple systems containing up to 96 nodes.

                                40

 

OpenVMS Cluster systems and storage communicate using a combination
of the following interconnects:

o  Memory Channel

o  CI

o  DIGITAL Storage Systems Interconnect (DSSI)

o  Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI)

o  Ethernet

o  Small Computer System Interface (SCSI)

In addition, when configured with suitable FDDI bridges, OpenVMS Clus-
ter configurations can use DS3/T3 and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)
networking infrastructures.

Applications running on one or more nodes in an OpenVMS Cluster sys-
tem share resources in a coordinated manner. While updating data, the
OpenVMS Cluster software synchronizes access to shared resources, pre-
venting multiple processes on any node in the cluster from uncoordi-
nated access to shared data. This coordination ensures data integrity
during concurrent update transactions. Application programs specify
the level of OpenVMS Cluster file sharing that is required; access is
then coordinated by the extended QIO processor (XQP) and Record Man-
agement System (RMS).

The OpenVMS queue manager controls the OpenVMS Cluster batch and print
queues, which can be accessed by any node in the OpenVMS Cluster. Batch
jobs submitted to OpenVMS Cluster queues are routed to any available
CPU so that the batch load is shared.

The Lock Manager provides synchronized services between systems in a
cluster, for use both by system components such as RMS and XQP, and
also for direct use by applications.

Two or more Alpha and VAX computers connected to the same Memory Chan-
nel, CI, DSSI, or SCSI interconnect must be configured as members of
the same OpenVMS Cluster system. Mixed-architecture and mixed-version
clusters that contain both Alpha systems and VAX systems are supported.

                                41

 

OpenVMS Cluster systems provide a uniform computing environment that
is highly scalable, highly available, and secure. OpenVMS Cluster soft-
ware implements a single-security environment within a cluster con-
figuration. The security subsystem ensures that all cluster-visible
objects maintain consistent security profiles and that system secu-
rity auditing controls operate clusterwide.

Refer to the OpenVMS Cluster Software Product Description (SPD 29.78.xx)
for more information.

Volume Shadowing for OpenVMS

Digital provides Volume Shadowing for OpenVMS Alpha and VAX products
for performing disk mirroring operations, using a redundant array of
independent disks (RAID) 1 storage strategy.

Volume Shadowing for OpenVMS is available for Alpha and VAX systems
as a separate licensed System Integration Product (SIP). Volume Shad-
owing for OpenVMS provides high data availability for disk devices by
ensuring against data loss that results from media deterioration or
controller or device failure. This prevents storage subsystem compo-
nent failures from interrupting system or application tasks.

The system disk and Files-11 On-Disk Structure 2 (ODS-2) data disks
can be volume shadowed. Spiralog data disks can also be shadowed.

Volume Shadowing for OpenVMS supports the clusterwide shadowing of Dig-
ital SCSI and DSA storage systems. Volume Shadowing for OpenVMS also
supports shadowing of all MSCP served DSA disks and Digital SCSI disks.
All disks in a single shadow set must have the same number of logi-
cal blocks and the same physical geometry. Shadow set members can be
located on a single system or anywhere in an OpenVMS Cluster system.
Disks can be configured on any MSCP or Digital SCSI-compliant controller.

Volume Shadowing for OpenVMS provides fault tolerance resulting from
disk media errors or controller errors across the full range of Al-
pha and VAX processors and configurations. Shadow set member units can
be located on different controllers and OpenVMS Alpha and OpenVMS VAX
MSCP servers, providing configuration flexibility and a high degree
of data availability.

                                42

 

Volume Shadowing for OpenVMS supports an unlimited number of single-
member shadow sets and up to 500 disks in multi-member (two or three
member) shadow sets on a standalone or OpenVMS Cluster system.

Phase I of Volume Shadowing (also known as controller-based shadow-
ing), which was available in the past on OpenVMS VAX, is no longer sup-
ported.

The binary kit for Volume Shadowing ships with the OpenVMS Alpha and
VAX distribution kits. To run the software, customers must purchase
a license. Refer to the Volume Shadowing for OpenVMS Software Prod-
uct Description (SPD 27.29.xx) for more information.

DECnet-Plus and DECnet Software

The DECnet for OpenVMS VAX and Alpha software is a System Integrated
Product (SIP) that is licensed separately from the OpenVMS operating
system. Refer to the DECnet for OpenVMS VAX and Alpha Software Prod-
uct Description (SPD 48.48.xx) for further information on supported
communications devices and software features.

DECnet-Plus (formerly DECnet/OSI) is licensed separately from the Open-
VMS operating system. The license for DECnet for OpenVMS VAX and Al-
pha also grants the rights to use DECnet-Plus. Note that only one ver-
sion of DECnet can be active on a single system at any one time. Re-
fer to the DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS Alpha Software Product Description
(SPD 50.45.xx) and the DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS VAX Software Product
Description (SPD 25.03.xx)) for further information on supported hard-
ware configurations and software features.

DigitalTCP/IP Software

Internet networking is available through the Digital TCP/IP Services
for OpenVMS layered product. This product provides TCP/IP networking,
Network File System (NFS), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Remote Ter-
minal Services (TELNET), and other features. Refer to the Digital TCP/IP
Services for OpenVMS Software Product Description (SPD 46.46.xx) for
further information.

RMS Journaling for OpenVMS

                                43

 

Digital provides the RMS Journaling for OpenVMS Alpha and VAX prod-
ucts as separately licensed SIPs that enable a system manager, user,
or application to maintain the data integrity of RMS files in the event
of a number of failure scenarios. These journaling products protect
RMS file data from becoming lost or inconsistent.

RMS Journaling provides the following three types of journaling:

o  After-image journaling. Allows users to reapply modifications that
   have been made to a file. This type of journaling allows users to
   recover files that are inadvertently deleted, lost, or corrupted.
   RMS Journaling recovers the file by applying the journaled modi-
   fications to a backup copy, thereby restoring its final state. Ap-
   plication modifications are not necessary to use after-image jour-
   naling.

o  Before-image journaling. Allows users to reverse modifications that
   have been made to a file. This type of journaling allows users to
   return a file to a previously known state. This is useful if a file
   is updated with incorrect or bad data. Application modifications
   are not necessary to use before-image journaling.

o  Recovery unit journaling. Allows users to maintain transaction in-
   tegrity. A transaction can be defined as a series of file updates
   on one or more files. If any failure occurs during the transaction,
   recovery unit journaling rolls back the partially completed trans-
   action to its starting point. This allows complex transactions to
   be completed as an atomic event-partially completed transactions
   can be avoided. Recovery unit journaling requires application mod-
   ification.

The binary kit for RMS Journaling ships with the OpenVMS Alpha and VAX
distribution kits. To run the software, customers must purchase a li-
cense and documentation. Refer to the RMS Journaling for OpenVMS Soft-
ware Product Description (SPD 27.58.xx) for more information.

DECram for OpenVMS



                                44

 

DECram for OpenVMS, a separately orderable layered product, is a disk
device driver that improves I/O performance by allowing an OpenVMS sys-
tem manager to create pseudo disks (RAMdisks) that reside in main mem-
ory. Frequently accessed data can be accessed much faster from a DE-
Cram device than from a physical disk device. These RAMdisks can be
accessed through the file system just as physical disks are accessed,
requiring no change to application or system software.

Because main memory is allocated for the DECram device, extra memory
is generally required. The OpenVMS system manager can designate the
amount of memory dedicated to the DECram device(s) and the files that
will be stored on it. The maximum size of a single DECram device is
524,280 blocks. Refer to the DECram for OpenVMS Software Product De-
scription (SPD 34.26.xx) for more information.

DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS

Digital offers a separately orderable layered product called DECwin-
dows Motif for OpenVMS. This product provides support for both OSF/Motif,
a standards-based graphical user interface, and the X user interface
(XUI) in a single run-time and development environment. DECwindows Mo-
tif displays the OSF/Motif user interface. Because both Motif and XUI
are based on X Consortium's X Window System, applications written on
either toolkit will run regardless of which environment the user se-
lects. Refer to the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS Software Product De-
scription (SPD 42.19.xx) for more information.

DECwindows Motif Version 1.2-4 for OpenVMS Alpha delivers the New Desk-
top environment for OpenVMS Alpha systems, which is derived from the
CDE (Common Desktop Environment) technology. CDE provides and defines
a consistent user interface for end users and a consistent develop-
ment environment for application developers across multiple platforms.

The OpenVMS software installation procedure contains an optional step
to install the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS workstation and font sup-
port, which is required to run the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS lay-
ered product. Refer to the OpenVMS Alpha Version 7.1 Upgrade and In-
stallation Manual or OpenVMS VAX Version 7.1 Upgrade and Installation


                                45

 

Manual for details concerning the optional installation of the DECwin-
dows Motif for OpenVMS device support.

Enhanced X Window System Display PostScript

The X Window System Display PostScript system provided with DECwin-
dows Motif extends the native X graphical programming environment for
DECwindows users. This system allows users to display text or images
on workstations that support the XDPS extension. The DECwindows Mo-
tif for OpenVMS layered product must be installed and licensed to use
Display PostScript.

The X Window System Display PostScript has two components:

o  Display PostScript server extension, which is provided with the dis-
   play server in the OpenVMS Alpha and OpenVMS VAX operating systems.
   A workstation is required to use this server.

o  Adobe client libraries, which are used by applications to perform
   PostScript operations, such as rotating and scaling fonts, gener-
   ating curves, and displaying PostScript documents. The Adobe client
   libraries are available in the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS lay-
   ered product, as well as on third-party platforms, including IBM,
   Sun, and Silicon Graphics.

X Display PostScript adds the following capabilities to the basic X11R6
Window System environment:

o  DECwindows fonts can be displayed at any size and rotation angle.

o  Display PostScript graphics are specified in a user-defined coor-
   dinate system independent of monitor density.

o  Color or gray-scale rendition is automatically modified to take ad-
   vantage of the monitor type through either direct display, color
   dithering, or half-toning.

o  Display PostScript display routines can be downloaded to the server
   and executed on command.

                                46

 

o  Sophisticated graphics primitives, such as precisely controlled Bezier
   curves, can be displayed.

The Display PostScript system also allows users to view PostScript files
with such applications as DECwindows Mail and the CDA Viewer without
generating hard copy. The Terms and Conditions for Display PostScript
can be found in the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS Software Product De-
scription (SPD 42.19.xx).

Monitoring Performance History (MPH) Software

Monitoring Performance History software (MPH) is distributed with the
OpenVMS Version 7.1 distribution kit and is installed separately. In-
stall this software after installing or upgrading the system to Open-
VMS Version 7.1.

MPH is a tool that collects information (such as error logs, crash dump
summaries, configuration, and performance data) from the system on which
it is installed. This data is transmitted back to Digital and is used
to set standard requirements for future releases of OpenVMS, such as
MeanTime Between Crash (MTBCr) and MeanTime Between System Interrup-
tion (MTBSi). The disk size requirement for MPH installation is ap-
proximately 1200 blocks. MPH requires 300 blocks of disk space per node
after installation.

MPH performs three main functions:

o  Captures updates to the error log

o  Captures the crash dump profile after the system reboots (if the
   crash dump is enabled and present.)

o  Captures changes to the hardware configuration of a cluster/node.

All data is stored in the MPH copy area (MPH$COPY) and is transported
to DPP on a weekly or daily basis.




                                47

 

MPH can use one of three transport mechanisms to copy data from the
MPH$COPY area:

o  DSNLink: MPH data is transferred via DSNLink to the CSC. The files
   are then copied from the CSC to the Digital processing site via Dig-
   ital's internal network.

o  Internet: MPH data is mailed via Internet directly to the Digital
   processing site.

CONFORMANCE TO STANDARDS

OpenVMS is based on the following public, national, and international
standards.

POSIX and XPG4 BASE Support

The OpenVMS environment, with POSIX for OpenVMS Version 2.0 and DEC
C installed, extends the support for POSIX standards to include the
X/Open BASE specifications defined in the X/Open Portability Guide,
Issue 4 (XPG4). The XPG4 BASE specifications extend the system appli-
cation programming interface and shell and utilities offered in the
IEEE POSIX standards. XPG4 also includes standards-based internation-
alization support.

The inclusion of XPG4 BASE support in the OpenVMS environment gives
application developers a broader set of standards-based portability
features to incorporate into their applications. Most applications that
strictly conform to the POSIX and XPG4 specifications can be devel-
oped on an OpenVMS system with POSIX for OpenVMS and the DEC C com-
piler, and then ported without modification to any other platform that
also supports the same POSIX standards and XPG4 specifications.

Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) Support

The DCE for the OpenVMS product family provides a set of the distributed
computing features specified by the Open Software Foundation's (OSF)
DCE, as well as tools for application developers. With DCE, the OSF
has established a standard set of services and interfaces that facil-
itate the creation, use, and maintenance of client/server applications.

                                48

 

DCE for OpenVMS serves as the basis for an open computing environment
where networks of multivendor systems appear as a single system to the
user. Because DCE makes the underlying networks and operating systems
transparent, application developers can easily build portable, inter-
operable client/server applications. Users can locate and share in-
formation safely and easily across the entire enterprise. DCE for Open-
VMS supplies system managers with a set of tools to consistently man-
age the entire distributed computing environment, while assuring the
integrity of the enterprise.

The DCE for OpenVMS product family currently consists of the follow-
ing products:

o  DCE Runtime Services for OpenVMS, which is required for all sys-
   tems participating in the DCE cell. The Runtime Services includes
   DCE client functions as well as DCE administration tools. DCE Run-
   time Services allows client/server applications to interoperate over
   DECnet, TCP/IP, and UDP/IP network protocols.

o  DCE Application Developers' Kit for OpenVMS, which is required for
   developers of distributed applications but is optional for other
   users. The DCE Application Developers' Kit provides programmers with
   an Interface Definition Language (IDL), an easy-to-use, ANSI C-based
   language for writing remote procedure calls.

o  DCE Cell Directory Service (CDS), one of which is required for each
   DCE cell. The DCE CDS is a central repository that contains infor-
   mation about the location of resources in the DCE cell. It allows
   access to resources by a single name, regardless of their physi-
   cal location.

o  Digital DCE Security Server, one of which is required for each DCE.
   The DCE Security Server protects resources from illegal access and
   provides secure communications within and between DCE cells.

The right to use the DCE Runtime Services is bundled with the Open-
VMS operating system base license. All other DCE products are avail-
able as separate layered products. Refer to the Digital Distributed
Computing Environment (DCE) for OpenVMS Software Product Description
(SPD 43.05.xx) for more detailed information.

                                49

INSTALLATION

OpenVMS Alpha is distributed as a binary kit on CD-ROM. Procedures for
setting up the system disk from media and for preparing the system for
day-to-day operations are provided. The procedures use the POLYCENTER
Software Installation utility to configure and install the OpenVMS Al-
pha Version 7.1 operating system. These procedures are described in
the OpenVMS Alpha Version 7.1 Upgrade and Installation Manual.

OpenVMS VAX is distributed as binary kits on CD-ROM and tape. Proce-
dures for setting up the system disk from a kit and for preparing the
system for day-to-day operations are provided. The procedures are de-
scribed in the OpenVMS VAX Version 7.1 Upgrade and Installation Man-
ual. Computer-specific information is contained in the upgrade and in-
stallation supplements for each family of VAX computers.

POLYCENTER Software Installation

The POLYCENTER Software Installation utility simplifies the instal-
lation and management of OpenVMS products. It is used to install, con-
figure, reconfigure, and deinstall software products that have been
prepared with the utility. In addition, the POLYCENTER utility pro-
vides a database to track the installation, reconfiguration, and de-
installation of software. For products installed with other instal-
lation technologies, the POLYCENTER utility provides a mechanism for
adding information about them into the product database. The POLYCEN-
TER utility also provides the ability to manage dependencies between
products during the installation process.

For software providers, the POLYCENTER Software Installation utility
simplifies the task of packaging software by providing a simple, declar-
ative language for describing material for the installation kit and
defining how it is installed. The POLYCENTER utility handles the func-
tions, while the developer instructs the utility what to do. This sig-
nificantly reduces the complexity and time to develop installation pro-
cedures. The language allows the developer to easily specify depen-
dencies on other software, manage objects in the execution environ-
ment (such as files and directories), and anticipate and resolve con-
flict before it occurs. The POLYCENTER utility also significantly sim-

                                53

 

plifies the packaging of multiple software products into one logical
product suite.

For OpenVMS Alpha, you use the POLYCENTER Software Installation util-
ity to install the operating system and to install layered products
that are compliant with the POLYCENTER utility.

For OpenVMS VAX, you use the POLYCENTER Software Installation util-
ity to install layered products that are compliant with the POLYCEN-
TER utility.

VMSINSTAL

OpenVMS includes the VMSINSTAL facility to handle the installation of
optional Digital supplied software products that have not been con-
verted to use the POLYCENTER Software Installation utility. OpenVMS
VAX also includes the VMSINSTAL facility to automate operating sys-
tem software updates.

Test Package and Diagnostics

OpenVMS includes a User Environment Test Package (UETP), which ver-
ifies that the OpenVMS operating system is properly installed and ready
for use on the customer's systems.

You can run diagnostics on individual devices during normal system op-
eration. Certain critical components can operate in degraded mode.

OpenVMS Alpha DISK SPACE REQUIREMENTS

Operating System Disk Space Requirements

The disk space requirements for OpenVMS Alpha vary according to which
options are installed:

upgrading__________________________________________________________

The minimum OpenVMS files listed in the table are for a system con-
figuration where all optional features have been declined during the
initial installation. For most applications, this is not a realistic
OpenVMS environment.

The paging, swap, and dump file requirements are the minimum for a sys-
tem with 32 MB of main memory. Additional memory in most cases adds
to the space needed for these files, as will particular needs of your
application. With careful system management it is possible to use the
paging file space as a temporary dump file.

For an OpenVMS Cluster system disk, paging, swap, and dump files can-
not be shared between nodes, so the files must either be duplicated
on the system disk or located on some other disk.

DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS Alpha Disk Space Requirements

To support OpenVMS Alpha and DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS Alpha, Dig-
ital recommends a system disk of greater than 480 MB. However, you can
install a subset of DECwindows Motif. The disk space required for the
installation of DECwindows Motif is 90 MB. The permanent amount of space
used is 89 MB. An additional 33 MB is needed to install the DECwin-
dows X11 Display Server and associated files. (The DECwindows X11 Dis-
play Server and associated files are included in the OpenVMS Alpha Ver-
sion 7.1 media.) These disk space requirements are in to addition the
disk space required for the OpenVMS Alpha Version 7.1 operating sys-
tem, as indicated in the OpenVMS Alpha Disk Space Requirements table.

Installation of the DECwindows Motif Version 1.2-4 layered product gives
customers the option of installing any or all of the following com-
ponents:

o  Run-time support base kit - 25 MB. This section provides support
   for running DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS Alpha applications on Al-
   pha compute servers and is a required part of the installation.

o  New Desktop - 21 MB. This is an optional component that allows use
   of the New Desktop environment. It includes applications and ap-
   plication programming interfaces (APIs).

o  DECwindows desktop - 4 MB. This component is also optional, but you
   should install either the New Desktop or the DECwindows desktop to
   create a usable system. The DECwindows desktop is the user inter-
   face that was included in previous versions of DECwindows Motif and
   includes the DECwindows Session Manager, FileView, and the Motif
   Window Manager.

o  Programming support - 7 MB. This section includes support for the
   DEC C, DEC C++, DEC Fortran, and Pascal programming languages. If
   you install a subset of languages, the amount of disk space required
   will be less.

o  Example files - approximately 7 MB.

o  Translated image support - approximately 17 MB.

                                56

 

Layered Product Disk Space Requirements

In addition to the disk space used directly by Digital or third-party
layered products, there may be additional space used to store infor-
mation from those products in OpenVMS help libraries, command tables,
object libraries, and elsewhere. The amount of additional disk space
required cannot be exactly predicted due to the possibility of recov-
ering unused space already existing in those library files. Unusually
large modules contributed by layered products can also affect the amount
of space required for upgrading to a new version of the OpenVMS Al-
pha operating system.

OpenVMS VAX DISK SPACE REQUIREMENTS

Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 3)

To support the complete OpenVMS VAX operating system environment, Dig-
ital recommends a system disk of greater than 150 MB. When you use a
smaller disk, additional tailoring is required before installing some
of the OpenVMS VAX options. This does not include the dump file space.
Refer to the OpenVMS VAX Version 7.1 Upgrade and Installation Manual
for information on tailoring.

Operating System Disk Space Requirements

Additional memory adds to the space required for page, swap, and dump
files, and the variable additional space increases with larger mem-
ory and disk.

DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS VAX Disk Space Requirements

To support OpenVMS VAX and the DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS VAX lay-
ered product, Digital recommends a system disk of greater than 280 MB.
The disk space required for the installation of DECwindows Motif is
36 MB. The permanent amount of space used is 36 MB. An additional 16
MB are needed to install the DECwindows X11 Display Server and asso-
ciated files. (The DECwindows X11 Display Server and associated files

                                58

 

are included in the OpenVMS VAX Version 7.1 media.) These disk space
requirements are in addition to the 78 MB required for the other com-
ponents of the OpenVMS VAX operating system environment. Refer to the
OpenVMS VAX Version 7.1 Upgrade and Installation Manual for details
on tailoring small system disks to support the DECwindows Motif en-
vironment.

Installation of the DECwindows Motif Version 1.2-4 layered product gives
customers the option of installing any or all of the following com-
ponents:

o  DECwindows Motif run-time support files base kit - 24 MB. This sec-
   tion provides support for running DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS VAX
   applications on VAX compute servers and is a required part of the
   installation. It includes the DECwindows desktop applications and
   libraries.

o  Programming support - 6 MB. This section includes support for the
   DEC C, DEC C++, DEC Fortran, Pascal, and VAX C programming languages.
   If a subset of languages is installed, the amount of disk space re-
   quired is less.

o  Example files - approximately 6 MB.

Note that the individual sizes add up to more than the total because
some components are shared by multiple portions of the environment.

MEMORY SPACE REQUIREMENTS

OpenVMS Alpha Memory Space Requirements

The minimum amount of memory supported for an OpenVMS Alpha environ-
ment is dependent on the software configuration and application re-
quirements. The following table gives examples of the minimum amount
of memory required for a system user to install, boot, and log in to
an OpenVMS Alpha Version 7.1. To ensure satisfactory performance for
particular applications or number of users, additional memory may be

Note: These are the minimum memory requirements. More memory is required
for satisfactory performance of the operating system and DECwindows
Motif applications. The performance and memory usage of DECwindows Mo-
tif systems is particularly sensitive to system configuration and win-
dow and application usage. Remote execution of an application requires
an additional system that runs the application while the display of
the application occurs on the local workstation.

Please refer to the associated layered product Software Product De-
scriptions for their memory requirements. Please refer to the Open-
VMS VAX documentation for more information concerning performance con-
siderations.

DOCUMENTATION

For OpenVMS Version 7.1, documentation is available in the following
of formats:

Printed Books

OpenVMS printed documentation is available in two sets: the OpenVMS
Full Documentation Set and the OpenVMS Base Documentation Set.

The Full Documentation Set is for users who need extensive explana-
tory information on all major OpenVMS resources, complete reference
information on system routines and utilities, detailed examples, Open-
VMS Cluster guidelines, programming concepts, a master index, and in-
formation on the Help Message utility. This set meets the needs of sys-
tem managers and of system and application programmers. It includes
the Base Documentation Set.

The Base Set includes the most commonly used OpenVMS manuals, address-
ing the needs of general users and system managers of small standalone
systems. Manuals, such as the Release Notes, New Features, and the DCL
Dictionary are included in the Base Set.

Each book in these sets is also separately orderable. A complete list-
ing of all hardcopy manuals and their part numbers is in the Overview
of OpenVMS Documentation.

Online Books

For Version 7.1, online documentation is distributed on the OpenVMS
Documentation CD-ROM. Customers will receive the entire documentation
set in Bookreader format and selected OpenVMS books in HTML format.
In addition, selected OpenVMS books, archived books, and selected man-
uals from affiliated products are available in PostScript and text for-
mats.

Selected DECnet-Plus documentation is included with OpenVMS Version
7.1 documentation. DECnet-Plus has replaced DECnet for OpenVMS (Phase


                                65

 

IV) in the main operating installation menu. To assist customers choos-
ing to move from DECnet Phase IV to DECnet-Plus, OpenVMS is deliver-
ing a one-time complimentary offering that includes DECnet-Plus bi-
naries and a DECnet-Plus Documentation Starter Kit.

The DECnet-Plus Documentation Starter Kit for OpenVMS Version 7.1 in-
cludes information to help the DECnet-Plus user install, plan, and man-
age their network.

DECnet Phase IV books are no longer part of the OpenVMS documentation
set and can be ordered separately.

discs contain all source listings files and the Alpha specific debug
symbol files that make up the OpenVMS operating system. Digital pro-
vides source listings for all key modules of the OpenVMS operating sys-
tem that are appropriate for end users or application developers. The
debug symbol files (DSF) on the OpenVMS Alpha Source Listings CD-ROM
contain information used by the OpenVMS Alpha System-Code Debugger.
Certain company confidential source listings and debug symbol files,
however, are excluded from the CD-ROM.

The orderable CD-ROM kit includes the license required to view these
files on a standalone system or an OpenVMS Cluster system. If users
want to make these files available to another system (possibly at a
remote site), they must purchase another kit.

Software License Information (VAX Only)

The OpenVMS VAX operating system uses one of two different categories
of licenses depending on the hardware and software configurations used
and currently supported. This information is also provided in the ap-
plicable country's Price List.

These are the two categories of operating system licenses for Open-
VMS VAX:

o  VAX VMS Licensing

o  OpenVMS VAX Licensing

System Support Services

                                75

 

Digital provides the proper license type with the purchase of the sys-
tem. Not all license types are available for every system model.

VAX VMS License Information

Note: Effective February 6, 1995, the VAX VMS (UPI001) licenses no longer
include the rights for the Digital Rdb Run-Time option for OpenVMS VAX,
and do not permit use of Rdb Runtime on prior versions of OpenVMS VAX.

Each of the following licenses are for a specified hardware system,
which is either the system the license was originally shipped with or
the system on which the license was first used:

o  Operating System Base License (QL-001**-**)

o  Operating System User License for OpenVMS VAX (QL-001**-**)

o  Traditional License for OpenVMS VAX (QL-001**-**)

There are four types of VAX VMS licenses:

1. Traditional License (QL-001A*-**)

This type of license provides unlimited use to the users on a defined
system. VAX VMS traditional licenses are sized to capacity according
to system type.

2. Multi-User License (QL-001A*-**)

This type of license provides use according to a specified number of
concurrent users. This is an activity-based license. The Multi-User
License provides the customer with the right to use the operating sys-
tem up to the limit of users specified in the license. An operating
system user is a person who is logged in to the system and is using
the system interactively. This license is only available on limited
system models, primarily MicroVAX and VAX 4000 systems.

The customer can increase interactive use of VAX systems licensed with
the Multi-User License by the addition of OpenVMS User Licenses* (for
one or more users). Refer to the section on Ordering Information for
further information.

3. VAX VMS Workstation License (QL-001A*-**)

                                76

 

This type of license provides use for a single user on a VAX worksta-
tion. This license type allows one direct login for the single user
and one additional login for system management purposes only.

Additional interactive use of VAX workstations licensed with the VAX
VMS Workstation License requires the addition of an OpenVMS User Li-
cense* (for one or more users). Refer to the section on Ordering In-
formation for further information.

4. File and Application Server License (QL-001A*-**)

This type of license provides for the noninteractive use of OpenVMS.

OpenVMS based VAXserver systems are sold with a File and Application
Server License. The intent of an OpenVMS based VAXserver is to pro-
vide file, print, application, and compute services to clients who have
submitted their requests remotely (for example via network/remote sub-
mit/batch jobs, and so forth). This license type also allows one di-
rect login for system management purposes only.

Additional interactive use of OpenVMS VAXserver systems licensed with
the File and Application Server License requires the addition of an
OpenVMS User License* (for one or more users). Refer to the section
on Ordering Information for further information.

These licenses grant the right to use the same version of the oper-
ating system software as permitted for the corresponding Operating Sys-
tem Base License at the time when the User License is installed.

Notes: Not all VAX VMS license types are available for all versions of
VMS, OpenVMS, or all VAX models.

The OpenVMS VAX Individual Use Licenses are not supported by the VMS
or OpenVMS VAX operating system releases prior to Version 5.5.

OpenVMS VAX License Information

stricted, noninteractive use of the OpenVMS VAX operating system for
the execution of remotely submitted requests for batch, print, appli-
cation, and computing services, on a designated, single processor. This
license authorizes one direct login for system management purposes only.

The OpenVMS VAX Base License does not include the license right for
the DEC Rdb Run-Time Option for OpenVMS VAX.

The Operating System Base License is a prerequisite for all Interac-
tive User Licenses and all SMP Base Extension Licenses.

Interactive use of systems licensed with an OpenVMS VAX Operating Sys-
tem Base License requires the addition of an OpenVMS User License (for
one or more users). Refer to the section on Ordering Information for
further information.

This license grants the right to use the same version of the operat-
ing system software as permitted for the corresponding Operating Sys-
tem Base License at the time when the User License is installed.

ignatable) and may be installed and used on a single OpenVMS VAX pro-
cessor or shared in a single OpenVMS VAXcluster.

A distributed interactive user is defined as an individual who is logged
in to an OpenVMS VAX processor or OpenVMS VAXcluster system or is in-
teractively using the operating system, software by means other than
a login.

                                79

 

This license grants the right to use the same version of the operat-
ing system software as permitted for the corresponding Operating Sys-
tem Base License at the time when the User License is installed.

5. OpenVMS Concurrent Use License (for both VAX and Alpha)
   (QL-MT3A*-3*)

sion to the OpenVMS Alpha Operating System License permits the use of
all existing Distributed Interactive User Licenses on the upgraded sys-
tem.

The Operating System Base License provides the right to use only the
OpenVMS features of the current or prior versions of the OpenVMS op-
erating system.

This license grants the right to use the same version of the operat-
ing system software as permitted for the corresponding Operating Sys-
tem Base License at the time when the User License is installed.

License Management Facility Support

The OpenVMS operating system supports Digital's License Management Fa-
cility (LMF).

If an OpenVMS license is not registered and activated using LMF, only
a single login is permitted for system management purposes through the
system console (OPA0:).

Several of the VAX VMS and OpenVMS VAX license types are based on the
number of concurrent users, called an activity license. Every prod-
uct has the option to define an activity as related to the LMF. Open-
VMS Interactive User and ADL Interactive User Licenses define the num-
ber of concurrent users that are activity licenses as defined by the

                                83

 

LMF. OpenVMS defines activities, sometimes referred to as an OpenVMS
user, as follows:

o  Each remote terminal connection is considered an activity. This is
   true even if users set host to their local nodes (SET HOST 0).

o  Each connection from a terminal server is considered an activity.

o  A multiple-window session on a workstation is considered one ac-
   tivity, regardless of the number of windows.

o  A batch job is not considered an activity.

o  A remote network connection (a connection other than a remote ter-
   minal connection) is not considered an activity.

For more information about Digital's licensing terms and policies, con-
tact your Digital account representative.

Appendix A

This appendix describes Digital Equipment Corporation terminals, disks,
tapes, controllers, graphics, and network options. Some restrictions
for specific devices are listed, if applicable.

Digital reserves the right to change the number and type of devices
supported by OpenVMS Alpha, OpenVMS VAX, DECnet for OpenVMS VAX and
Alpha, DECnet-Plus, and OpenVMS Cluster software. The minimum hard-
ware requirements for future versions and updates of these software
products may be different from current hardware requirements. For con-
figuration details about Alpha or VAX hardware, refer to the Systems
and Options Catalog and the Network and Communications Buyers Guide.

Refer to the following SPDs for detailed product information: DECnet
for OpenVMS (SPD 48.48.xx), DECnet-Plus (SPD 50.45.xx, 25.03.xx), Open-
VMS Cluster Software (SPD 29.78.xx), and Digital Open3D for OpenVMS
Alpha (SPD 45.08.xx).

Terminals and Terminal Line Interfaces

To prevent input from overflowing a buffer, terminals use the ASCII
control characters DC1 and DC3 for synchronization as defined by Dig-
ital's DEC STD 111, Revision A. VXT windowing terminals support stan-
dard ANSI applications and X Windows using the LAT transport proto-
col.

The following table lists the terminals that are supported by Open-
VMS Alpha:

VT200          VT300          VT400 series
series         series




                                91

 


VT500          VXT2000
series         series

The following table lists the terminals that are supported by Open-
VMS VAX:

VT52           VT100          LA series
               series

VT300          VT1000         LQP02
series         series

VT200          VT500
series         series

Terminals on Professional 350, Rainbow 100, and DECmate II systems em-
ulate VT100 terminals.

Only limited support is available for the VT52. The VT131, when run-
ning an application, operates in block mode. When interacting with Open-
VMS VAX and associated utilities, the VT131 operates only in VT100 (or
interactive) mode and not in block mode.

Note: The VT1000 is a monochrome windowing terminal that supports stan-
dard ANSI applications and the X Window System. The transport proto-
col supported is LAT for VMS. The product supports 15-inch and 19-inch
monitors.

Disks

The first column lists the disk drive. The second column describes the
device. The third column lists the bus the device is supported on. The
fourth column lists the minimum required version of OpenVMS Alpha that
supports these devices. The fifth column lists the minimum required
version of OpenVMS VAX that supports these devices. (NS stands for Not
Supported.)
