 DESCRIPTION                                                                    
                                                                                
 DECconcentrator 500 Software Microcode is dedicated Microcode that runs        
 in the DECconcentrator 500 hardware platform:                                  
    DEFCN-AA, -AB, -AC, -AD, -BA, -BB, -BC, -BD                                 
                                                                                
 The Microcode is stored in electrically alterable ROM that resides in          
 the DEFCN-A*, -B* hardware platform and is maintained over power out-          
 ages and system resets. The DECconcentrator 500 hardware platform is           
 designed to comply with the ANSI X3T9.5 FDDI Standard.                         
                                                                                
 The DECconcentrator 500 hardware platform can be configured to suit            
 specific customer application and cable plant requirements. It sup-            
 ports management modules with Dual-Attachment-Station (DAS) ports ("A"         
 and "B" ports), which can directly connect to an FDDI dual ring, as            
 well as support for several multi-port module options (with SAS "M"            
 Ports) to connect devices via the concentrator to the FDDI dual ring.          
 Depending on the option selected, there is support for several media           
 types including Multimode Fiber (MMF), Single-Mode Fiber (SMF), Shielded       
 Twisted-Pair (STP), and ThinWire coax (TW). Both Digital and non-Digital       
 FDDI devices, such as workstations, servers, systems, bridges, etc.,           
 can be connected to FDDI dual ring networks via the concentrator.              
                                                                                
 The DECconcentrator 500 hardware platform is shipped from the factory          
 with the DECconcentrator 500 Software Microcode preloaded and can be           
 updated via downline load when new versions of the Microcode are is-           
 sued.                                                                          
                                                                                
 General characteristics of the DECconcentrator 500 Software Microcode          
 are:                                                                           
                                                                                
 o  Performs initialization and module bootstrapping.

 o  Performs diagnostic selftest automatically at power-up and also when        
    initiated by network management software.                                   
                                                                                
 o  Performs FDDI Station Management (SMT) as specified by the ANSI X3T9.5      
    SMT V7.2 draft standard, including support for PMF "sets."                  
                                                                                
 o  Holds and updates all the DECconcentrator 500 counters and settable         
    parameters.                                                                 
                                                                                
 o  Supports reception, processing, and transmission of remote network          
    management packets generated by network management software uti-            
    lizing SNMP (including simple sets), RBMS, MOP, or SMT protocols.           
    Requires a Management Module:                                               
       DEFCN-MA, -MB, -MF, -MH, -CA, -CF, -DA, -DF, -EA, -EF                    
                                                                                
 o  SNMP mib support includes MIB II (RFC 1213), FDDI mib (RFC 1285)            
    and a DEC vendor mib.                                                       
                                                                                
    Note: Exact compliance with RFC 1285 is not possible due to con-            
    flicts between it and ANSI X3T9.5 SMT V7.2. See release notes for           
    details.
