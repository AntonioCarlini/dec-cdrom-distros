PRODUCT NAME:  DEC Network Integration Server Software, Version 3.0 SPD
36.05.08

DESCRIPTION

The DEC Network Integration Server (DECNIS) 500/600 product provides
multiprotocol routing, bridging, and X.25 gateway services to host sys-
tems on local area networks (LANs) connected to the DECNIS or to host
systems connected to the DECNIS over wide area network (WAN) connec-
tions. The DECNIS 500/600 software runs on any DECNIS 500 or 600 hard-
ware unit.

Overview

The DECNIS software provides a routing service for:

o  TCP/IP hosts

o  DECnet Phase IV nodes

o  DECnet/OSI Phase V nodes

o  OSI-compatible systems

o  Novell[R] NetWare[R] nodes

o  AppleTalk[R] nodes

Multiprotocol routing of IP, DECnet, and OSI is implemented using the
Integrated Intermediate System to Intermediate System (Integrated IS-
IS) routing protocol. Routing of IP traffic is also supported using
Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
and Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP). Routing of Novell NetWare and Ap-
pleTalk is implemented on the LAN using native protocols and over the
WAN using encapsulation within IP.

                              DIGITAL                 December 1994

The DECNIS software supports bridging of protocols that can not be routed
by the DECNIS. Both local bridging between LANs connected to the same
DECNIS unit, and remote bridging between two DECNIS units connected
over WAN links are supported.

The DECNIS software provides X.25 gateway and relay services to con-
nect end systems on a LAN to X.25 Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) con-
nected directly to the DECNIS or connected over an X.25 Packet Switched
Data Network (PSDN).

The DECNIS software image is installed and configured on a host sys-
tem called the load host. Once configured, the DECNIS software image
and configuration file is loaded from the load host system to the tar-
get DECNIS unit. When loaded, the DECNIS software image can be stored
in internal non-volatile (FLASH) memory so that subsequent software
loads can be performed without the need for loading from a load host
(flash loading). DECNIS systems equipped with the MPC-II (DNSAN-BH)
can store multiple configuration files in non-volatile (FLASH) mem-
ory.

The DECNIS software is managed using the Network Command Language (NCL)
command line interface which can be run on the DECNIS MPC-II (DNSAN-
BH) and accessed via the console, or from any MS-DOS[R], DEC OSF/1[R],
or OpenVMS for VAX system. Event logging and data tracing utilities
are also available on DEC OSF/1 AXP and OpenVMS for VAX systems to as-
sist problem solving by logging network events and by tracing control
messages received or sent by the DECNIS software.

The DECNIS software can be managed from the POLYCENTER/NetView[R] net-
work management platform or any system supporting the Simple Network
Management Protocol (SNMP). SNMP sets, gets, and traps are supported
where appropriate for MIB-II, Bridge MIB, FDDI MIB and Digital Ven-
dor MIB variables.







                                 2

 

IP Routing

The DECNIS software provides support for the following IP routing pro-
tocols:

o  OSPF V2 (RFC 1247)

o  Integrated IS-IS (RFC 1195)

o  RIP (RFC 1058)

o  EGP (RFCs 827, 888, and 904)

The DECNIS supports the OSPF Version 2 protocol as defined by RFC-1247.
TOS 0 routing only is supported. The DECNIS OSPF implementation also
supports the modifications and enhancements proposed in the replace-
ment draft RFC, in particular the virtual link support enhancements
and support for IP address super-netting. OSPF is managed using the
DECNIS configuration utility and the NCL command line interface.

The DECNIS supports the Integrated IS-IS routing protocol as defined
in RFC 1195. When using Integrated IS-IS, the software supports equal-
cost path splitting of IP data over up to four equal-cost paths. Vari-
able, but contiguous, IP subnet masks are also supported. Integrated
IS-IS is managed using the DECNIS configuration utility and the NCL
command line interface.

The DECNIS also supports the RIP (RFC 1058) and EGP (RFCs 827, 888,
and 904) routing protocols. Support for multiple instances of RIP and
EGP is provided. In addition to IP routing protocols, the software also
supports IP reachable addresses (static routes). RIP and EGP are man-
aged using the DECNIS configuration utility and the NCL command line
interface. MIB-II variables as defined in RFC 1213 can also be man-
aged using SNMP sets and gets.

The DECNIS software communicates with IP hosts and gateways on the lo-
cal LAN using the ARP protocol (RFC 826). Proxy ARP (RFC 1027) is also
supported. The DECNIS software also supports Path MTU Discovery tech-
nique as specified in RFC 1191, and ICMP Router Discovery Messages as
specified in RFC 1256 to allow IP hosts to distinguish the DECNIS as
a router using ICMP messages and procedures. Using ICMP, the DECNIS

                                 3

 

periodically broadcasts ICMP Router Advertisement messages and responds
to ICMP Router Solicitation messages from IP Hosts. All management pa-
rameters defined in RFC 1256 are supported.

The DECNIS software supports IP Standby, a mechanism that greatly im-
proves the resilience of backbone networks. Enhancements have also been
made to the Integrated IS-IS routing protocol algorithm to reduce the
time taken to re-compute new routes. IP Standby works in conjunction
with Integrated IS-IS by providing fast IP router failover should a
router, its LAN connection, or one of its WAN circuits fail. In a typ-
ical network, failover is achieved in a way that is totally transpar-
ent to applications running on IP host systems.

The DECNIS software supports full propagation of routes between dif-
ferent routing protocols, for example between OSPF, Integrated IS-IS,
RIP, and EGP. The propagation of IP routes learnt through one rout-
ing protocol into another protocol can be controlled using the DEC-
NIS configuration utility and the NCL command line interface. Controls
can be added to include or exclude routes from single nodes, subnets,
or collections of subnets. For RIP and EGP, controls can set up be-
tween multiple instances of each protocol.

The DECNIS software supports IP routing over CSMA/CD, FDDI, PPP, HDLC,
Frame Relay and SMDS circuits, or dynamically assigned X.25 circuits.
The DECNIS also supports IP routing over X.25 data links in accordance
with RFC 877, and over PPP data links in accordance with RFC 1332.

DECnet Routing

The DECNIS software implements both the DECnet Phase IV routing al-
gorithm (routing vector) and the DECnet/OSI Phase V routing algorithm
(link state routing). The DECNIS software supports both intra-area rout-
ing (level 1) and inter-area routing (level 2). The DECNIS software
can run either the Phase IV or Phase V routing algorithm in either com-
bination at each level. When running the Phase V algorithms at either
level 1 or level 2, the routing software is still able to handle traf-
fic generated by DECnet Phase IV end systems and performs any neces-
sary address and header conversions. DECnet routing is managed using
the DECNIS configuration utility and the NCL command line interface.

                                 4

 

The DECNIS software supports path splitting over up to four routing
circuits. If the cost between the router and the destination node is
the same on multiple WAN circuits, then the DECNIS software splits the
traffic across all the circuits.

It is also possible to route IP traffic using RIP within a DECnet Phase
IV only network by running RIP over the DECnet Phase IV level 1 or level
2 links. An IS-IS routing circuit is required in order to handle IP
traffic either within a level 1 area or between areas over a level 2
link.

The DECNIS supports DECnet routing over CSMA/CD, FDDI, HDLC, DDCMP,
and Frame Relay circuits, and over dynamically and statically assigned
X.25 circuits. The DECNIS software also supports DECnet routing over
PPP data links in accordance with RFC 1376.

OSI Routing

The DECNIS software fully implements the requirements of an OSI In-
termediate System. The DECNIS software exchanges information about reach-
ability of end systems using the OSI IS-IS Intra-Domain Routing Ex-
change Protocol as specified in ISO/IEC 10589. OSI-compatible end sys-
tems on the same LAN can exchange information with the DECNIS soft-
ware and use the OSI End System to Intermediate System (ES-IS) Rout-
ing Exchange Protocol as specified in ISO 9542. OSI routing is man-
aged using he DECNIS configuration utility and the NCL command line
interface.

The DECNIS software supports OSI Connectionless Network Protocol (CLNP)
routing as specified in ISO 8473, over CSMA/CD, FDDI, HDLC, Frame Re-
lay and SMDS circuits, and over dynamically and statically assigned
X.25 circuits. The DECNIS software also supports OSI CLNP routing over
PPP data links in accordance with RFC 1377.







                                 5

 

Novell NetWare Routing

The DECNIS software provides support of native Novell NetWare proto-
cols over Ethernet and FDDI. Ethernet-II, 802.2, Encapsulated Ether-
net (802.2 SNAP), and 802.3 RAW (Novell) data link formats are sup-
ported. The following Novell NetWare protocols are supported:

o  Novell NetWare IPX Forwarding

o  Novell NetWare Routing Information Protocol (RIP)

o  Novell NetWare Service Access Protocol (SAP)

Novell IPX is supported over wide area links using IP encapsulation
according to RFC 1234. The DECNIS software also supports native IPX
over leased line circuits using the PPP data link protocol but with
no negotiated options. Novell IPX routing is managed using the DEC-
NIS configuration utility and the NCL command line interface.

The DECNIS software has been tested and certified for use as a LAN router
with Novell NetWare V3.11 and V4.01 by Novell's test laboratory in Utah.

A DECNIS PC LAN Protocol software license is required for each DEC-
NIS hardware unit running Novell NetWare.

AppleTalk Routing

The DECNIS software provides support of native EtherTalk[R], the Ap-
ple[R] specification for AppleTalk over Ethernet and FDDI. EtherTalk
uses 802.2 SNAP data link format. The following AppleTalk protocols
are supported:

o  AppleTalk Phase-II Forwarding

o  AppleTalk Phase-II EtherTalk

o  AppleTalk Phase-II Address Resolution Protocol (AARP)

o  AppleTalk Phase-II Routing Table Maintenance Protocol (RTMP)

o  AppleTalk Phase-II Name Binding Protocol (NBP)

o  AppleTalk Phase-II Zone Information Protocol (ZIP)

                                 6

 

o  AppleTalk Phase-II Echo Protocol (echo replies only)

AppleTalk is supported over wide area links to other DECNIS systems
using IP encapsulation. AppleTalk routing is managed using the DEC-
NIS configuration utility and the NCL command line interface.

A DECNIS PC LAN Protocol software license is required for each DEC-
NIS hardware unit running AppleTalk.

Bridging

The DECNIS software supports local and remote bridging between LANs
for protocols that cannot be routed (e.g., Digital's LAT) or that are
not supported by the DECNIS routing software (e.g., Xerox[R] XNS). The
DECNIS software supports a maximum of 15 local or remote bridge port.

DECnet, IP, OSI, IPX, and AppleTalk protocols are normally routed and
cannot be bridged except in the following cases:

o  IP, IPX, and AppleTalk traffic can either be individually routed
   or bridged on a system wide basis. When routing is not enabled for
   any one or more of these protocols, it will be bridged on all in-
   terfaces. Bridge filtering can be enabled for IP, IPX, and AppleTalk
   on a port-by-port basis.

o  OSI null-Internet frames will always be bridged over the Ethernet
   or FDDI interfaces.

The DECNIS software implements the IEEE 802.1D Spanning Tree Proto-
col and will interoperate with other Digital or IEEE 802.1D-compliant
bridges in the same extended LAN. When used as a local bridge, the DECNIS
software forwards data packets from one LAN interface to another LAN
interface. When bridging IP packets between FDDI and Ethernet inter-
faces, frames larger than 1518 bytes will be fragmented before trans-
mission over the Ethernet.

The DECNIS software supports remote bridging using the DEC WANcontroller
622 and 622/HS network interface cards. Remote bridging is not sup-
ported on the DEC WANcontroller 614 or 618 network interface cards.

                                 7

 

Remote bridging is supported over PPP, HDLC, and Frame Relay circuits;
it is not supported over X.25 and SMDS data links.

Remote bridging is also supported between a DECNIS unit and NSC[R]/Vitalink[R]
TransLAN[R] bridges using the Vitalink Control Protocol (VCP). Remote
bridging is supported between a DECNIS 500/600 using the DEC WANcon-
troller 622 network interface card and NSC/Vitalink TransLAN III, IV,
320, 335 or 350 remote bridges or TransPATH 335 or 350 bridge/routers
running either TransLAN V11.1.4 or TransPATH V11.2.5 software or later.

When used with TransLAN bridges only one bridging link is supported
at a time; load balancing over multiple links is not supported. The
Vitalink DLS protocol is not supported by the DECNIS.

Tinygram compression is supported in accordance with RFC 1220 over PPP
and VCP data links. This allows Ethernet and 802.3 frames which are
padded with zeros, such as LAT frames, to be compressed over remote
bridging links. Bridging over multiple remote hops is supported sub-
ject to the Bridging Configuration Guidelines section below.

Bridging is managed using the DECNIS configuration utility and the NCL
command line interface. Bridge MIB variables as defined in RFC 1493
can also be managed using SNMP sets and gets. Bridge traffic, both lo-
cal and remote, may be filtered based on a combination of source or
destination address and protocol type on a port-by-port basis.

A DECNIS Bridge license is required for each DECNIS hardware unit run-
ning local or remote bridging.

Bridging Configuration Guidelines

When bridging over remote links, the performance of delay-sensitive
protocols (such as LAT) cannot be guaranteed without careful consid-
eration of the number of bridging hops and the speed of the lines con-
necting the DECNIS units.





                                 8

 

Digital warrants and supports the DECNIS product when used in extended
LAN configurations subject to the following configuration restrictions:

o  Remote bridging is only supported on the DEC WANcontroller 622 and
   622/HS network interface cards; it is not supported on the DEC WAN-
   controller 614 or 618 network interface cards.

o  The minimum line speed supported for remote bridging between DEC-
   NIS units is 56 Kbits/s.

o  Remote bridging is supported over PPP, HDLC, and Frame Relay data
   links but is not supported over X.25 or SMDS circuits, or over satel-
   lite links.

o  The maximum number of bridging ports supported by the DECNIS is 15.
   Consequently, the maximum number of remote bridging links that can
   be configured on the DECNIS is limited to 15.

o  A maximum of seven local and remote bridges may be configured in
   series between any two communicating end stations. Each DECNIS unit,
   or any other IEEE 802.1D or LANbridge 100 compatible bridge, counts
   as one bridge towards this maximum configuration of seven bridges.

o  Local Area VAXcluster (LAVC) is not supported over remote bridg-
   ing links.

o  PATHWORKS services may be restricted over remote bridging links;
   please refer to the relevant Software Product Descriptions for fur-
   ther information.

o  When bridging between a DECNIS and NSC/Vitalink TransLAN, load bal-
   ancing and DLS are not supported.

In addition to the above configuration restrictions, and, when using
56 Kbits/s or 64 Kbits/s links between DECNIS units for remote bridg-
ing of LAT, Digital also recommends the following configuration guide-
lines to ensure reliable operation:

o  A maximum of two serial synchronous links should be used in the span-
   ning tree path between the LAT server and the LAT host.

                                 9

 

o  A minimum of 3 Kbits/s should be allocated for each active LAT ses-
   sion which needs to be supported simultaneously across the remote
   link. When using Tinygram compression, 2 Kbits/s should be allo-
   cated for each active LAT session.

o  Links should be reserved for LAT and not shared with routed traf-
   fic such as DECnet, OSI, or IP. Also, other bridged traffic which
   may generate unnecessary traffic over the remote link should be fil-
   tered using the DECNIS Bridge Filtering facilities.

Routing and Remote Bridging over Frame Relay

The DECNIS software supports connections over Frame Relay data links
as specified in the Frame Relay Specification jointly developed by Dig-
ital Equipment Corporation, StrataCom[R], Inc., Northern Telecom[R],
and Cisco Systems Inc.

Multiple virtual circuits can be multiplexed over a single Frame Re-
lay link using the Data Link Control Identifier (DLCI) field of the
Frame Relay LAPD header. For details of the Frame Relay options im-
plemented, refer to the CONFORMANCE TO STANDARDS section of this SPD.

Routing of IP, DECnet, and OSI protocols, and remote bridging of other
protocols, is supported over Frame Relay data links using PPP encap-
sulation within the Frame Relay frame. IPX and AppleTalk can also be
routed over Frame Relay within IP. The DECNIS Frame Relay implemen-
tation supports both the LMI and ANSI-D switch control procedures.

Frame Relay is only supported on the DEC WANcontroller 622 and 622/HS
network interface cards. A maximum of 32 Frame Relay PVCs can be con-
figured per physical interface with an overall limit of 128 per DEC-
NIS system. A maximum of 15 Frame Relay PVCs can be configured for re-
mote bridging per DECNIS system.







                                10

 

Routing over Switched Multi-megabit Data Service (SMDS)

Switched Multi-megabit Data Service is a connectionless, cell-switched
data transport service and is available at speeds between 56 Kbits/s
and 45 Mbits/s. The DECNIS software implements the SMDS Date Exchange
Interface (DXI) according to the Bellcore specification using SIP 3
PDUs of up to 4500 bytes with DXI CRC and with 6 octet SMDS addresses.
An external SMDS CSU/DSU is required to provide SIP 2 and SIP 1 func-
tions.

Using the WANcontroller 622/HS, the following SMDS Classes of Service
are supported:

o  1.473 Mbits/s using T1 or E1 access lines

o  4 Mbits/s, 10 Mbits/s, or 16 Mbits/s using T3 or E3 access lines

Routing of IP, DECnet, and OSI protocols is supported over SMDS us-
ing OSPF, Integrated IS-IS and RIP routing protocols. IPX and AppleTalk
can also be routed over SMDS within IP.

Routing over X.25

The DECNIS software supports routing over statically and dynamically
assigned X.25 virtual circuits. Static X.25 circuits are established
when the routing circuit is enabled and remain established until the
routing circuit is disabled. Dynamically assigned X.25 circuits are
established only when there is information to send over the routing
circuit. They are disconnected when there is no further information
to send.

The DECNIS X.25 software supports routing over either Permanent Vir-
tual Circuits (PVCs) or Switched Virtual Circuits (SVCs). Each X.25
virtual circuit can run only one routing protocol. However, differ-
ent routing protocols can be run over separate virtual circuits on the
same X.25 DTE connection.




                                11

 

Backup Circuits

The DECNIS supports a backup circuit feature which detects the fail-
ure of a primary routing circuit and establish an alternative or backup
routing circuit for the duration of the failure. Primary routing cir-
cuits can be PPP, HDLC or DDCMP leased line circuits while secondary
circuits can be leased line or switched public network services such
as dialup, ISDN or X.25. Invoke and revoke timers can be set up to con-
trol the time to wait before enabling or disabling the backup circuit.

A primary circuit and a backup circuit can be grouped so that one backup
circuit can be shared between a number of primary circuits to reduce
costs. For example, an ISDN connection can be used as a backup cir-
cuit for a number of leased line primary circuits. Backup circuits can
also be cascaded such that a backup circuit of one group can be a pri-
mary circuit of another.

Packet Prioritisation

The DECNIS software supports packet prioritisation on the LANcontroller
601/602 and WANcontroller 622 network interface cards so that differ-
ent protocols or traffic types can be given the different priorities
over LAN and WAN links. Traffic can be prioritized based on protocol
type, for example IP, IPX, DECnet, OSI or bridge traffic. Within IP,
traffic can be additionally prioritized based on TCP/UDP port number,
protocol type or Type of Service. Bridge traffic can also be prior-
itized based on SAP value, PID value or Ethernet type.

The DECNIS supports up to eight levels of priority. Packets can be as-
signed to priority groups which are then assigned to one of the eight
queues. The queues are then processed in order such that high prior-
ity packets are always transmitted first. The maximum queue length can
be set for each queue to ensure that packets in each queue are pro-
cessed appropriately.

A simple packet filtering mechanism for out bound traffic can be im-
plemented by assigning packets to be filtered to a specific queue whose
queue length has been set to zero. Packet and byte counters allow the


                                12

 

number of packets transmitted and discarded to be monitored on a per
interface basis.

Note that the DECNIS automatically prioritizes routing and bridge con-
trol traffic to ensure that network stability is maintained at all times.

Pattern Matching

An extension to the packet prioritisation mechanism allows priority
packets to be further classified by packet pattern matching. Specific
bit sequences can be matched with masks and on the basis of a match,
packets can be assigned to different priority queues. For example, LAT
service groups can be filtered to allow only certain services to be
advertised across the network.

X.25 Gateway

When operating as an X.25 Gateway, the DECNIS software transmits and
receives X.25 packets to and from any of the following systems:

o  Any Digital systems which support the DNA Gateway Access Protocol
   (GAP)

o  Any systems located on the same LAN which support the ISO Logical
   Link Control 2 (LLC2) protocol (as described in ISO 8881)

o  Any X.25 DTE accessible over an X.25 Public Switched Data Network
   (PSDN) connected to the DECNIS

o  Any X.25 DTE connected directly to a port of the DECNIS operating
   in X.25 DCE mode (ISO 8208 point-to-point mode)

o  Any X.25 DTE connected to any other DECNIS accessible over the DEC-
   net/OSI routing network

When providing wide area access to an X.25 PSDN for end systems on the
LAN which use LLC2, the DECNIS software fully implements the recom-
mendations in ISO Technical Report 10029 as a CONS LAN/WAN relay.


                                13

 

X.25 packets can be relayed locally between any X.25 DTE attached to
the DECNIS hardware unit and any other similarly attached X.25 DTE or
any X.25 system connected to the same LAN. Additionally, X.25 pack-
ets can be relayed to remote X.25 DTEs accessible to other DECNIS or
DEC X.25 gateway 100/500 servers over a DECnet/OSI routing network.
The software does not support the relaying of X.25 packets generated
from an X.25 DTE connected to one X.25 PSDN to an X.25 DTE connected
to another X.25 PSDN.

X.25 DTE and Virtual Circuit Support

The DECNIS X.25 software supports a maximum of 32 DTEs per system, ir-
respective of the number of available ports on network interface cards.
The DECNIS allows multiple connections to one or more X.25 PSDNs and
can share outgoing calls between all of the DTEs connected to an X.25
PSDN. The X.25 Networks section of this SPD provides details of the
public X.25 PSDNs and X.25 (1988) optional facilities supported by the
DECNIS X.25 software.

The DECNIS X.25 software supports both Switched Virtual Circuits (SVCs)
and Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVCs). A maximum of 128 virtual cir-
cuits per system is supported irrespective of the number of available
ports on network interface cards. When using X.25 relay, 2 virtual cir-
cuits are used for each LLC2 connection, one for the incoming connec-
tion and one for the outgoing connection. Each DECNIS system can there-
fore support a maximum of 64 X.25 relay connections.

The actual number of X.25 virtual circuits which the DECNIS can sus-
tain at any time may be less than 128 and depends on such factors as
the rate at which calls are set up and cleared down, the level of traf-
fic, and the ratio of routing to gateway traffic.









                                14

 

X.25 Accounting and Security

The following accounting information is provided by the DECNIS X.25
Gateway software:

o  Logging of virtual circuit accounting when calls are cleared

o  Logging of accounting records to a designated Event Logging sink

o  Logging to multiple sinks for reliability

The following security mechanisms are supported by the DECNIS X.25 Gate-
way software:

o  Inbound and outbound calls can be controlled on the basis of the
   remote DTE, the application, and, if applicable, the X.25 Access
   node

o  Access to accounting sink management is restricted to authorized
   users

o  Access to accounting source management is restricted to authorized
   users

Installation and Configuration

The DECNIS software image is installed on a host system called the load
host. The following load hosts systems are supported:

o  PCs running MS-DOS

o  Alpha AXP systems running DEC OSF/1 AXP

o  VAX systems running OpenVMS

Once installed on the load host, the DECNIS software is configured us-
ing the host configuration and DECNIS configuration utilities supplied
with the product. The host configuration utility allows the DECNIS units
to be defined in the load host's network node database. It also al-
lows the appropriate system image and unique configuration file for
each DECNIS unit to be defined in the load host's network node database.
The DECNIS configuration is used to create the unique configuration
file for each DECNIS unit.

                                15

 

The DECNIS software image and individual configuration files are loaded
from the load host system to each target DECNIS unit using BOOTP or
Digital's Maintenance Operation Protocol (MOP). Loading can be either
locally on the same LAN or extended LAN (downline loading), or over
an HDLC point-to-point link from a local DECNIS unit connected directly
to the target DECNIS unit (agent loading).

When using agent loading, the DECNIS system performing the loading op-
eration must be configured to copy the required files from a suitable
load host. Agent loading of DECNIS units may also be daisy-chained over
a number of HDLC links provided that the first DECNIS in the chain is
on the same LAN as the load host and each member of the chain is a DEC-
NIS unit.

The minimum requirement is for one load host. However, the DECNIS soft-
ware image and configuration files can be copied to any number of re-
mote load hosts within the network for local loading. The DECNIS soft-
ware allows BOOTP load requests broadcast over a LAN to be forwarded
to a BOOTP server located anywhere within the network. This helps to
protect against loss of service if the main load host is unavailable
or unable to load the system for any other reason.

When loaded, the DECNIS software image and, optionally, the config-
uration file, can be stored in the DECNIS internal non-volatile (FLASH)
memory so that subsequent software loads can be performed without the
need to load from a load host (flash loading).

Management

The DECNIS software conforms to both the IETF Structure of Management
Information and to Digital's DECnet Network Architecture (DNA). Man-
agement of the DECNIS is supported using either the Simple Network Man-
agement Protocol (SNMP) or Digital's implementation of the Control Man-
agement Information Protocol (CMIP).

The DECNIS supports two types of management processor card:

o  MPC-I (DNSAN-AH) - this card has 8 MB of dynamic memory and 2 MB
   of non-volatile (FLASH) memory.

                                16

 

o  MPC-II (DNSAN-BH) - this card has 16 MB of dynamic memory and 4 MB
   of non-volatile (FLASH) memory, and a console port for out-of-band
   management. The console port provides VT100 terminal support and
   full modem control for remote connection over a dial up line.

The DECNIS software is managed dynamically using the Network Command
Language (NCL) command line interface. The MPC-II (DNSAN-BH) supports
on-board NCL for dynamic out-of-band management of both the local DEC-
NIS router and remote Digital routers from the console interface. NCL
can also be run on any MS-DOS, DEC OSF/1 AXP, or OpenVMS for VAX sys-
tem to provide in-band management of DECNIS systems.

Dynamic management tasks that can be performed using NCL include:

o  Management of connections, for example, set up the data links, en-
   able and disable circuits

o  Monitoring of network traffic, for example, enable event logging,
   display counters

o  Problem solving, for example, test circuit availability, perform
   loopback tests

Event logging and data tracing utilities are also available on DEC OSF
/1 AXP, OpenVMS or ULTRIX systems to assist problem solving by log-
ging network events and by tracing control messages received or sent
by the DECNIS software.

The DECNIS software can also be managed dynamically from POLYCENTER
/NetView network management platforms or from any system supporting
the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). SNMP sets and gets are
supported where appropriate for the variables defined in the follow-
ing Management Information Bases (MIBs):

o  Digital Vendor MIB

o  MIB-II (RFC 1213)

o  Bridge MIB (RFC 1493)

                                17

 

o  FDDI MIB (RFC 1285)

MIB-II interface support is provided for CSMA/CD, FDDI, PPP, HDLC, VCP,
LAPB, and DDCMP data links. SNMP traps are also supported with the abil-
ity to send traps to up to four destinations. SNMP can only be used
to manage MIB variables when IP routing is enabled.

The DECNIS responds to, but can not source, IP Pings and OSI Echo re-
quests. The DECNIS can also forward echo requests and responses.

Network Sizing

The DECNIS software allows memory to be allocated to statically as-
signed network parameters to suit different network requirements. This
memory is allocated during configuration. The memory left over can be
allocated during operation to dynamically assigned network parameters
when needed. This feature is called Dynamic Database Sizing.

The DECNIS configuration utility checks to ensure that memory is not
over allocated and also indicates how much memory is left over for dy-
namically assigned parameters. When the DECNIS is running, event mes-
sages are generated if any of these parameters are approached or ex-
ceeded. Full information about which network parameters can be set and
how much memory is used is included in the DECNIS documentation. Please
consult your local Digital office for more details and for assistance
with network sizing and planning.

DECNIS Hardware

The DECNIS software requires either a DECNIS 500 or DECNIS 600 series
hardware unit and one or more network interface cards. The DECNIS 500
supports up to two network interface cards and the DECNIS 600 supports
up to seven network interface cards.

The following LAN interface cards occupy a single slot of the DECNIS
enclosure and are supported by the DECNIS 500 and DECNIS 600 hardware
units:

o  DEC LANcontroller 601 - Single-port Ethernet/IEEE 802.3 interface

                                18

 

o  DEC LANcontroller 602 - Dual-port Ethernet/IEEE 802.3 interface

The following LAN network interface card occupies two slots of the DEC-
NIS enclosure and is supported by the DECNIS 600 hardware unit only:

o  DEC FDDIcontroller 621 - Single-port FDDI interface, SAS, or DAS

The following WAN interface cards occupy a single slot of the DECNIS
enclosure and are supported by the DECNIS 500 and DECNIS 600 hardware
units:

o  DEC WANcontroller 614 - Four-port, low-speed synchronous interface
   supporting synchronous line speeds from 1.2 Kbits/s to 128 Kbits
   /s or asynchronous line speeds from 1.2 Kbits/s to 38.4 Kbits/s

o  DEC WANcontroller 618 - Eight-port, low-speed synchronous inter-
   face supporting synchronous line speeds from 1.2 Kbits/s to 128 Kbits
   /s or asynchronous line speeds from 1.2 Kbits/s to 38.4 Kbits/s

o  DEC WANcontroller 622 - Dual-port, medium-speed synchronous inter-
   face supporting synchronous line speeds from 9.6 Kbits/s to 3.1 Mbits
   /s

o  DEC WANcontroller 622/HS - Dual-port, high-speed synchronous in-
   terface supporting synchronous line speeds from 64 Kbits/s to 12
   Mbits/s

Communications over WAN point-to-point links is full-duplex with full
modem control on all line(s). HDLC, PPP, and X.25 data links are sup-
ported on all WAN interface cards. Synchronous and asynchronous DDCMP
data links are only supported on the DEC WANcontroller 614 and 618 net-
work interface cards. Frame Relay and remote bridging are only sup-
ported on the DEC WANcontroller 622 and 622/HS network interface cards.
The table below summarizes data link support on the WAN interface cards.

Physical Line Support

The DEC WANcontroller 614, 618, 622 and 622/HS network interface cards
support V.24 interchange circuits with the following electrical in-
terfaces:

o  DEC WANcontroller 614

   -  V.28 (EIA-RS232-D/EIA-RS232-C)

   -  V.36/V.11 (RS449/RS422)

   -  V.35

A multi-standard distribution panel with separate adapter cables pro-
vides the necessary interchange circuits for each synchronous port,
allowing different interface standards to be supported on each port.

o  DEC WANcontroller 618

   -  V.28 (EIA-RS232-D/EIA-RS232-C)

   -  V.36/V.11 (RS449/RS422)

   -  V.35

Separate distribution panels with appropriate interface cables pro-
vide the necessary interchange circuits for each synchronous port al-
lowing the same interface standard to be supported on each port. An
extra adapter cable is used with the RS422/V.11 distribution panel to
connect to British Telecom Kilostream services.

o  DEC WANcontroller 622 and 622/HS:

   -  V.36/V.11 (RS449/RS422)

                                20

 

   -  V.35

   -  CCITT X.21 (leased line services)

   -  British Telecom Kilostream and Megastream

Separate adapter cables provide the necessary interchange circuits for
each port. A CCITT X.21 adapter cable is used to connect to British
Telecom Kilostream and Megastream services.

Reflected clock signals may need to be set up when using the WANcon-
troller 622/HS to connect to DSU/CSUs at line speeds greater than 6
Mbits/s. This depends on the interface and the length of cable used.

The synchronous ports on each network interface cards provide only the
electrical interface of a DTE rather than a DCE, and do not provide
clock signals. An external clock source (such as a modem or DSU/CSU)
is required for each synchronous connection.

Table 1 shows the adapter cables required for each of the electrical
interface types.

Notes:

1. This should be ordered as part BS23V-02, which contains not only
   the BC23V-02 adapter cable to provide the V.28/V.24 (RS232-D) in-
   terface, but also an adapter that allows it to be used for RS232-
   C as well. It is only supported with the DEC WANcontroller 614; it
   is not supported for use with the DEC WANcontroller 622 or 622/HS.

2. The BC19C-02 adapter cable is used with a 50-way D-type connector
   with the DEC WANcontroller 614 when connecting to the BT Kilostream
   service or with the DEC WANcontroller 622 or 622/HS when connect-
   ing to the BT Kilostream and Megastream services, or CCITT X.21 leased
   line services. When connecting the DEC WANcontroller 618 to use the
   BT Kilostream service, the BC21G-02 should be used in conjunction
   with the V.11/RS422 distribution panel.

T1 and G.703 Services

The DEC WANcontroller 622 and 622/HS support only clear channel in-
terfaces. Connection to a T1 or G.703 line requires a V.35/RS422 to
T1/G.703 DSU/CSU converter to provide framing to meet CCITT G.704. The
DEC WANcontroller 622 and 622/HS do not provide either T1 framing pulses
or separate channels for 64 Kbits/s control data for G.703.

The DEC WANcontroller 622 and 622/HS do not guarantee line density.
T1 links can offer only 1.536 Mbits/s or 1.344 Mbits/s rates. 1.536
Mbits/s rates require the DSU/CSU converter to offer B8ZS and the line
to accept bipolar violations. 1.334 Mbits/s rates require the DSU/CSU
converter to offer B7.

The DEC WANcontroller 622 and 622/HS use CCITT 114 to clock data out
of the DTE and will source a CCITT 113 transmit clock. CCITT 113 should
be used by the DCE to receive the transmit data. The DEC WANcontroller
622 and 622/HS implement CCITT 113 as a buffered version of CCITT 114.
This clocking scheme ensures both network synchronization and mini-
mized skew between the clock and data for a range of cable lengths and
parameters.



                                22

 

If the transmit clocking mechanism is not provided by the DCE, the DCE
must provide a method of adjusting the phase of the clock used to sam-
ple the data with respect to that supplied to the DTE. This requires
that the DCE provide test points to allow analysis of the clock and
data wave forms and that this adjustment be performed on installation
and after any subsequent alteration of the connection cable. This al-
ternative method is also required for DCEs using the X.21 interface.

For more information about CSU/DSU converters supported by the DEC WAN-
controller 622 and 622/HS, please contact your local Digital office
for a list of compatible CSU/DSU converters available in your coun-
try.

Notes:

1. The X.25 relay does not act on any of these fields. The informa-
   tion contained in these fields is passed transparently and has only
   end-to-end significance.

2. PSDN hunt groups are supported but each DTE must be assigned a unique
   address independent of the hunt group address.

3. Support for this facility depends on the user application and the
   X.25 client implementation. Refer to the X.25 client product SPD
   for details.

4. For connector mode operation, the facilities supported by the DEC-
   NIS software may be restricted by the X.25 client implementation.
   Refer to the X.25 client product SPD for details.

The DECNIS software does not support the following items of the CCITT
X.25 recommendation:

-  Multi-link protocol

                                29

 

-  Use of the D-bit in outgoing packets

Performance

When operating over serial line connections the overall packet rate
will be less than that indicated by the aggregate line speeds and is
determined by such factors as:

o  Type of traffic (routing updates or data packets) and data rates

o  Mix of protocol types

o  Proportion of leased line to X.25 and Frame Relay traffic

o  The path of messages passing through the product (WAN-to-WAN, WAN-
   to-LAN, or LAN-to-LAN)

o  Communications line characteristics

o  Frequency and type of errors on the serial links

o  Network topology

o  Protocol overhead

Each PC on which the DECNIS software is installed must have:

o  MS-DOS installed and running

o  At least 8 MB of memory (RAM)

o  At least 40 MB of hard disk space for installation and 24MB for per-
   manent use

o  32 MB of hard disk space for each dump file

o  A 3.5-inch floppy disk drive from which to install the software

o  An Ethernet adapter which uses either a Digital native data link
   (DLL) or an NDIS driver.

The following Digital Ethernet controllers have been tested with the
DECNIS software:

   -  EtherWORKS and EtherWORKS 3 adapters

   -  DEPCA adapters

   -  DEPEA Personal Ethernet adapter

Note that Digital Ethernet NDIS drivers for the EtherWORKS adapters
can also be used with the previous DEPCA adapters. Ethernet controllers
other than those listed above that have their own NDIS drivers may work
with the DECNIS software but have not been tested by Digital.

Each Alpha AXP, VAX, or RISC processor on which the DECNIS software
is installed must have:

o  A valid system configuration for the relevant operating system and
   where applicable the appropriate DECnet/OSI product (refer to the
   appropriate operating system SPDs); and

o  A direct LAN or serial line WAN connection to the DECNIS hardware
   unit.

o  An appropriate device from which to install the software:

These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
system environment, configuration, and software options. The space in-
dicated for permanent occupancy does not include the space required
to receive an upline dump if that facility is enabled. The amount of
space required for dumps depends on the exact hardware configuration.
This could be from 20,000 to 60,000 blocks (10 MB to 30 MB) for each
dump depending on the DECNIS configuration.
