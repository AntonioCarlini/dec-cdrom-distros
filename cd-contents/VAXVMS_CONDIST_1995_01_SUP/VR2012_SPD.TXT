          DESCRIPTION


          Overview

          The WANrouter 90/250 software runs on the DECwanrouter 90, DECwanrouter
          90EW, and DECrouter 250 hardware units. These access router hardware
          platforms contain both local and wide area communication ports. To-
          gether, the hardware and software form routing nodes and provide a net-
          work routing service for computer systems and PCs connected to the com-
          munications ports.

          The following sections contain more information on the capabilities
          of the WANrouter 90/250 software (referred to as WANrouter software
          for the remainder of this document).

          WANrouter 90/250 Software, Version 1.2                SPD 36.24.04


          The WANrouter software provides support for the following IP routing
          protocols:

          o  Integrated Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) pro-
             tocol for routing in pure TCP/IP and dual environments, as spec-
             ified in RFC 1195.

          o  RIP (Routing Information Protocol) for routing in pure TCP/IP en-
             vironments, as specified in RFC 1058. (Note that in DECnet Phase
             IV areas, where DECnet Phase IV routing algorithms are used, RIP
             should be used instead of integrated IS-IS.)

          o  Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGPs) as specified in RFCs 827, 888,
             and 904.

          Integrated IS-IS is the OSI IS-IS Intra-Domain routing, with additions
          for IP routing as defined in RFC 1195. IP Reachable Addresses may also
          be manually configured for static routes over CSMA/CD, serial, or X.25
          circuits.

          When using Integrated IS-IS, the WANrouter software provides equal-
          cost path splitting of IP data over equal-cost paths. Variable, but
          contiguous, IP subnet masks are also supported.

          IP hosts and gateways on the same CSMA/CD circuit as the router are
          identified by the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) as described in
          RFC 826. Proxy ARP (RFC 1027) is also supported.

          The WANrouters can communicate directly with IP hosts or gateways over
          CSMA/CD circuits. They inter-operate with other IP gateways using RIP
          or EGP on these circuits.

          IP datagrams can be forwarded over:

          o  CSMA/CD circuits using Ethernet format packets

          o  Serial synchronous circuits using HDLC, or DDCMP data links

          o  Serial asynchronous circuits using DDCMP data links

          o  Dynamically assigned X.25 circuits. Note that X.25 static circuits
             (DLM) are not supported.

          WANrouter 90/250 Software, Version 1.2                SPD 36.24.04


          When operating over DDCMP or HDLC circuits, the software directly com-
          municates only with other Digital routers. When operating over X.25
          dynamic circuits, the software can communicate with other routers and
          end systems that support the OSI connectionless network service over
          X.25 data links. Forwarding of IP traffic over X.25 circuits is sup-
          ported in accordance with RFC 877.

          Novell Netware Routing

          The WANrouter software provides support of native Novell NetWare pro-
          tocols using Ethernet, Ethernet-II, 802.2, Encapsulated Ethernet (802.2
          SNAP), and 802.3 RAW (Novell) datalink formats. The following Novell
          NetWare protocols are supported:

          o  Novell NetWare IPX Forwarding

          o  Novell NetWare Routing Information Protocol (RIP)

          o  Novell NetWare Service Access Protocol (SAP)

          Novell IPX is supported over wide area links using IP encapsulation
          according to RFC 1234. Novell IPX routing is managed using the WAN-
          router configuration utility and the NCL command line interface.

          DECnet Routing

          The WANrouter 90/250 software implements IS-IS (link state routing)
          as the DECnet/OSI Phase V routing protocol. Note that the DECnet/OSI
          Phase V routing protocol also supports DECnet Phase IV end systems.

          For backward compatibility, the WANrouter 90/250 software also imple-
          ments DECnet Phase IV routing (router vector routing).

          The WANrouter 90/250 software supports both intra-area routing (Level
          1) and inter-area routing (Level 2). The router can run either the Phase
          IV or Phase V routing algorithm in either combination at each level.

          Routers within the same DECnet area must use the same routing algo-
          rithms, either DECnet Phase IV or DECnet/OSI Phase V, but not both.

          Communication with other DECnet end systems or routers over the se-
          rial connections can use either DDCMP (synchronous or asynchronous),
          HDLC (synchronous only), or X.25 data link circuits.

          If the routing circuit costs are set appropriately, the WANrouter 90
          /250 software performs path splitting across up to four routing paths
          of equal cost. Note that routing cost is an arbitrary network manage-
          ment parameter set by the network manager to control network traffic
          flow. If the cost between the router and the destination node is the
          same on multiple circuits, then the software splits the traffic across
          the circuits.

          OSI Routing

          The WANrouter 90/250 software fully implements the requirements of an
          OSI Intermediate System. The WANrouter 90/250 exchanges information
          about reachability of end systems using the OSI Intermediate System
          to Intermediate System (IS-IS) Intra-Domain Routing Exchange Proto-
          col as specified in ISO/IEC 10589.

          OSI-compatible end systems on the same Local Area Network can exchange
          information with the WANrouter 90/250 using the OSI End System to In-
          termediate System (ES-IS) Routing Exchange Protocol as specified in
          ISO 9542.

          The WANrouter 90/250 software uses the OSI Connectionless Network Pro-
          tocol (CLNP), as specified in ISO 8473, to communicate with OSI-compatible
          systems over an ISO 8802/3 or IEEE 802.3 Local Area Network. Commu-
          nication over the serial links uses the synchronous HDLC data link pro-
          tocol, the synchronous/asynchronous DDCMP data link protocol, or the
          synchronous X.25 packet-level protocols.

          Routing over X.25 PSDNs

          The WANrouter 90 and 250 support the use of dynamically assigned X.25
          routing circuits. Dynamically assigned circuits are established only
          when there is information to send over the routing circuit. They are
          disconnected when there is no further information to send. DA circuits
          are only supported between different areas using Level 2 routing.  Note
          that static circuits (X.25 DLM) are not supported.

                                           5

 



          WANrouter 90/250 Software, Version 1.2                SPD 36.24.04


          The WANrouter 90/250 supports up to 8 physical connections (if avail-
          able) to one or more X.25 PSDNs. The software can share outgoing calls
          between all the DTEs connected to a PSDN. The software supports rout-
          ing over Switched Virtual Circuits (SVCs).

          Each X.25 virtual circuit can run only one routing protocol. However,
          different routing protocols can be run over separate virtual circuits
          on the same X.25 DTE connection.

          Routing over Dial-up or Switched Services

          The WANrouter software supports direct call/answer procedures for dial-
          up access using the "raise DTR" method for outgoing and "Ring Indi-
          cate" for incoming calls. Switched circuits may be defined as:

          o  Static Outgoing - calls are established when the circuit is enabled
             and stay established until the circuit is disabled.

          o  Static Incoming - calls are established by the remote router and
             stay established until the circuit is disabled locally or by the
             remote router.

          o  Dynamically assigned - calls are established on receipt of traf-
             fic and cleared on expiration of a timer when the circuit is idle.

          Failover using Switched Services

          Switched circuits can also be defined as secondary routing circuits
          which can be enabled when the primary routing circuit fails. The pri-
          mary circuit is constantly monitored and the secondary circuit enabled
          should the line be lost. Conversely, the secondary circuit is disabled
          and the primary circuit re-enabled should the primary line recover.

          Installation, configuration and loading

          The WANrouter software is installed and configured on a host system
          (termed a load host). A load host may be any of the following systems:-

          o  OpenVMS/VAX

          o  RISC/ULTRIX

                                           6

 



          WANrouter 90/250 Software, Version 1.2                SPD 36.24.04


          o  MS-DOS for IBM-compatible PCs

          The minimum requirement is for one host to load the target router. How-
          ever, WANrouter software can be installed on a number of load hosts.
          This helps to protect against loss of service if a single load host
          is unavailable, or unable to load the system for any other reason.

          Once installed, the router software must be configured using config-
          uration programs supplied with the product. The host configuration util-
          ities allow the router hardware to be defined in the load hosts' net-
          work node database. The router configuration utilities allow a unique
          initialization script file to be created for each router installed.
          Once configured, the software image and initialization script file are
          then downline loaded from the load host to the router hardware over
          the local or wide area network.

          Loading over the Local area network uses Digital's Maintenance Oper-
          ation Protocol (MOP). In addition, BOOTP/TFTP is also supported on the
          DECwanrouter 90EW.

          MOP may be used to load over the wide area network via a point-to-point
          link from a DECnet/OSI host, or from a DECNIS router which has been
          configured to use Agent Loading.

          When using agent loading, the load host may be located anywhere in the
          Wide Area Network accessible to the Agent Loading router. This Agent
          loading router must be configured to copy the WANrouter software im-
          age and initialization scripts from the load host using DECnet/OSI and
          to load these over the direct point-to-point link with the target router
          using MOP.

          Network Management

          The WANrouter software conforms to both the IETF Structure of Manage-
          ment Information and the Digital Enterprise Management Architecture
          (EMA). Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) or Digital's imple-
          mentation of the Control Management Information Protocol (CMIP) are
          used to manage the WANrouters

          WANrouter 90/250 Software, Version 1.2                SPD 36.24.04


          The WANrouter software is managed dynamically from any MS-DOS, DEC OSF
          /1 AXP, OpenVMS or ULTRIX system using the Network Command Language
          (NCL) command line interface. Dynamic management tasks that can be per-
          formed include:

          o  Management of connections, for example, set up the data links, en-
             able and disable circuits.

          o  Monitoring of network traffic, for example, enable event logging,
             display counters.

          o  Problem solving, for example, test circuit availability, perform
             loopback tests.

          Event logging and data tracing utilities are also available on DEC OSF
          /1 AXP, OpenVMS or ULTRIX systems to assist problem solving by log-
          ging network events and by tracing control messages received or sent
          by the WANrouter software.

          The WANrouter software can also be managed dynamically from POLYCEN-
          TER/Netview network management platforms or from any system support-
          ing the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). SNMP gets are sup-
          ported where appropriate for the variables defined in the Management
          Information Base MIB-II (RFC 1213). MIB-II interface support is pro-
          vided for CSMA/CD, HDLC, LAPB, and DDCMP datalinks. SNMP can only be
          used to monitor MIB variables when IP routing is enabled.

          The WANrouter responds to, but can not source, IP Pings and OSI Echo
          requests. The WANrouter can also forward echo requests and responses.

          Dynamic management of the router provides only temporary changes to
          the router configuration. These temporary changes are lost when the
          hardware unit is re-loaded with the original script file.

          Permanent changes to the configuration of the WANrouter software can
          be made by re-using the configuration utilities to create a script file
          and then downline loading these to the hardware unit.

          Network Size and Supported Circuits

          DECnet Phase IV networks are hierarchical networks that can be seg-
          mented into up to 63 areas, each containing up to 1,023 nodes. Note
          that these are maximum values permitted by the Digital Network Archi-
          tecture, and that satisfactory operation in large networks requires
          proper network planning. DECnet/OSI Phase V Domains can be virtually
          unlimited. However, the actual size of a Domain is limited by the prod-
          uct's memory size and processor power.

          Internet addresses are 32 bit quantities which can be divided into five
          different classes where the classes differ in the number of bits as-
          signed to the network and host portions. Depending on the network class,
          different numbers of host systems can be supported within a network.
          Also, by using subnet masks, a further network hierarchy can be over-
          laid within a network.

          Tables 1 and 2 list the values of the parameters used to determine the
          size of the supported network for each hardware unit. Note that these
          figures are given as a guide only. Actual sizes experienced will de-
          pend on a number of factors including the topological characteristics
          of the network, the mix of protocols and data link interfaces, and the
          amount of routing control traffic generated by the network. Consult
          your local Digital Sales office for more details and for assistance
          with network sizing and planning.

          Performance

          The DECrouter 250 can saturate the band width of all serial lines at
          the speeds shown in Table 4 with packet sizes of 128 bytes or greater.

          The DECwanrouter 90 and 90EW products have a maximum system perfor-
          mance of approximately 100 packets per second.

          The actual performance of packets forwarded by any given WANrouter 90
          /250 depends on many protocol and network topology considerations. Some
          of these considerations are:

          o  Mix of protocol types

          o  Type of traffic (routing updates or data packets) and data rates

          o  The proportion of leased line to X.25 traffic

          o  Communications line characteristics

          o  Frequency and type of errors on the synchronous or asynchronous links

          o  Network topology stability

          o  Protocol overhead

          __________________+_4x9.6K_________________________________________

          Serial Interfaces

          Each serial interface may operate in either synchronous or asynchronous
          mode. When running in asynchronous mode, the DDCMP data link must be
          selected for that port. The dial-out features listed in the section
          Routing over Dial-up or Switched Services are not supported on the DECwan-
          router 90 model when operating over asynchronous DDCMP connections.
          These features are supported on the DECwanrouter 90 when operating in
          synchronous mode and for the DECwanrouter 90EW and DECrouter 250 when
          operating in asynchronous or synchronous mode.
          All serial ports operate in full-duplex mode and support full modem
          control for manual or auto dial/answer modems conforming to Bell stan-
          dards and CCITT recommendations, including V.22, V.22bis and V.32.

          Six of the DECrouter 250 ports are V.24/V.28 (EIA-232-D) and operate
          up to 19.2bps. The physical connection to these is via a standard ISO
          2110 25 pin connector.

          WANrouter 90/250 Software, Version 1.2                SPD 36.24.04


          Two of the ports on the DECrouter 250 and all ports on the DECwanrouter
          90/90EW modules utilize a multi-standard connector. These require use
          of an appropriate adapter cable to support one of the following elec-
          trical and physical interface standards:

          Note that for all platforms, when any port is configured for V.28/V.24
          (EIA-232-D/C) or asynchronous mode, the speed is restricted to 19.2Kbps
          maximum.

          Serial Adapter Cables

          Different adapter cables are required for the DECwanrouter 90 and 250
          (DEWAR/DSRVR) and DECwanrouter 90EW (DEWA2) models as shown in the ta-

          Modem Support

          All serial ports operate in full-duplex mode and support full modem
          control for manually dialed and auto-answer modems conforming to Bell
          standards and CCITT recommendations.

          SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

          The WANrouter software requires at least one local or remote system
          to act as a load host. That system needs to be one of the following:

          o  a VAX-based system running the OpenVMS operating system

          o  a RISC-based system running the ULTRIX operating system

          o  an IBM compatible PC running the MS-DOS operating system

          WANrouter 90/250 Software, Version 1.2                SPD 36.24.04


          Each OpenVMS system acting as a load host or dump receiver requires:

          o  OpenVMS VAX Operating System V5.5-2 or later

          o  DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS VAX V5.6B or later

          Each RISC/ULTRIX system acting as a load host or dump receiver requires:

          o  ULTRIX Operating System V4.3A

          o  DECnet/OSI for ULTRIX V5.1A

          Each MS-DOS system acting as a load host or dump receiver requires:

          o  MS-DOS Operating System V5.0 or later

          When using the router configuration utility on a PC, the program needs
          at least 8 MByte of extended memory free for a typical configuration.
          For more complex configurations involving multiple circuits, more than
          this amount of free memory may be required.

          GROWTH CONSIDERATIONS

          The minimum hardware/software requirements for any future version of
          this product may be different from the requirements of the current ver-
          sion.
