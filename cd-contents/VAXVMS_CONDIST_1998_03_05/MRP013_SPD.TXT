 PRODUCT NAME:  VAX Message Router/P Gateway, Version 1.3        SPD
 28.94.03

 DESCRIPTION

 VAX Message Router/P Gateway (MRP) is a network server layered soft-
 ware product that resides on an OpenVMS[TM] VAX[TM] system providing
 interconnection between MAILbus[TM], Digital Equipment Corporation's
 Message Router based electronic message transfer service, and IBM[R]'s
 OfficeVision/VM[TM] (OV/VM) systems in an SNA network. Through MRP,
 users of Digital office automation systems such as DEC MAILworks[TM]
 and ALL-IN-1[TM] Integrated Office System can send and receive mes-
 sages, documents, and binary files (MS-DOS[R] files for example) to
 and from users of IBM OV/VM office systems. Simple messages (Notes)
 may be exchanged with users of IBM's CMS systems.

 VAX Message Router/P Gateway provides both address and content con-
 version for messages and documents passed between the Digital[TM] and
 the IBM OV/VM networks. In this way, users are not required to learn
 any new commands or procedures except the new addresses representing
 the users of the other network(s) with whom they can now communicate
 by means of MRP. MRP connects to an IBM OV/VM host system and other
 OV/VM nodes have access to the Digital network through their RSCS con-
 nections over the SNA network to that IBM host. No Digital software
 is required to be installed on the IBM system to accomplish these trans-
 fers. With some restrictions, MRP allows users of IBM OV/VM office sys-
 tems to communicate through MAILbus to other networks including X.400
 public messaging services.

 Message address conversion is accomplished through the Directory Ser-
 vice (DDS) function of Message Router. Each Digital user sending and
 receiving mail to and from IBM users must be registered in DDS and as-
 signed an "alias" or virtual address for the OV/VM network. Limited
 one-way message transfer from MAILbus to IBM is possible without user

 registration in DDS. The recipient (addressee) list of a single mes-
 sage and stored distribution lists can include both Digital and IBM
 users. Delivery Confirmation and Non-Delivery Notification messages
 are supported.

 During MRP configuration, a number of options for message content con-
 version may be chosen on a per-OV/VM node basis. To preserve maximum
 revisable content, documents from the Digital network can be converted
 to IBM's DCA Revisable Format. Where users of IBM systems only have
 access to simple text editors, conversions of all messages and doc-
 uments can be made to OV/VM Note format or DCF Final format. This op-
 tion is available on a per destination OV/VM node basis and should also
 be chosen to support the sending of CMS Notes to IBM VM systems where
 OV/VM has not been installed. Digital text messages with one or more
 attached text documents may be concatenated into a single document for
 transfer to the OV/VM network. Alternatively messages containing mul-
 tiple attachments from the Digital MAILbus network can be separated
 into multiple individual messages by MRP for onward transmission to
 a OV/VM system since the IBM network does not support messages with
 more than one attachment. The product documentation describes the ca-
 pabilities and limitations regarding this functionality.

 Binary non-text file types, identified in the Digital network as DEC-
 bodypart 7 (FOREIGN) or DECbodypart 11 (MS-DOS), will be transferred
 unconverted to the IBM OV/VM network. Such files sent from a Digital
 to an IBM OV/VM network will lose their Digital RMS attributes. This
 binary file transfer capability is primarily intended for the trans-
 fer of MS-DOS files between the Digital and IBM networks. Files tagged
 as DCA RFT files (for example, a document created on a PC based word
 processing system) can be identified in the OV/VM network as a DCA RFT
 document. Not all Digital User Agents and Gateways can append these
 tags to DECbodypart 7 or DECbodypart 11 files. Multiple binary files
 attached to a single message may be passed to the IBM environment as
 multiple messages. These conversion options are chosen during MRP con-
 figuration.

 Content and identity conversions for Digital to IBM transfers are sum-
 marized in the following table. Conversions options are chosen on a
 per OV/VM destination node basis; for example, all messages to users
 on a particular OV/VM system will have the selected conversions per-
 formed on them.

  o  Conversions to DCA RFT Level 3 Final Document format (RFT-F) are
    not supported, conversions to DCA RFT are to DCA RFT Draft format
    only.

 Messages and documents from the IBM OV/VM network in DCA RFT format
 may be converted to DECdx format or remain in DCA RFT format as a DEC-
 bodypart 7 with an RFT tag. Not all versions of Digital User Agents
 and Gateways support this tagging scheme. Other text and document file
 types are converted to ASCII while the remainder are passed through
 the MRP Gateway unconverted and identified as DECbodypart 7 or DECbodypart 11
 files, and are assigned RMS fixed length 512 byte records. Binary file
 transfer from OV/VM may be disabled during MRP configuration.

 Content and identity conversion for IBM to Digital transfers are sum-
 marized in the following table. Conversion options are chosen on a per
 Gateway basis.

 Note: A OV/VM document with an accompanying message becomes a MAILbus
 message with an attached document.

 ALL-IN-1 Integrated Office System can automatically convert DECdx for-
 mat to WPS-PLUS format. Other Digital user agents and MAILbus Gate-
 ways can convert DECdx format to a format appropriate to their func-
 tion. Since the capabilities of each vendor's word processing systems
 are not identical and some control information is not transmitted, not
 all attributes and functions are converted. The MRP product documen-
 tation lists the restrictions. Users are responsible for understand-
 ing the capabilities of destination systems when sending binary files.

 Binary file transfer should not be used with ALL-IN-1 Integrated Of-
 fice System, Version 2.2 or earlier nor with VMSmail (the OpenVMS Mail
 Utility), Version 5.1 or earlier.

 A single MRP installation will support messaging services between an
 SNA based network of IBM OV/VM systems and a MAILbus network of Dig-
 ital OpenVMS VAX systems and between the OV/VM network and any other
 messaging network connected to that MAILbus network. Service levels
 obtained in this latter case will depend on the characteristics of the
 other network.

 To provide connection to MAILbus, the VAX Message Router software is
 required by and included with the software license and media kit for
 VAX Message Router/P Gateway.

 INSTALLATION

 MRP forms only one part of a distributed multi-vendor electronic mes-
 saging application. Important activities such as coordination with other
 messaging components, modification of the IBM system parameters, and
 the creation or update of subscriber entries in the directory service
 must precede the installation of this product. Digital offers a num-
 ber of services to assist customers with these tasks. Refer to the SOFT-
 WARE PRODUCT SERVICES section for more information.

 Previous versions of VAX Message Router/P Gateway provided connection
 to IBM's now discontinued Professional Office System (PROFS[R]) sys-
 tems. While this functionality has not been removed from MRP, Digi-
 tal can no longer guarantee support for this configuration since IBM
 itself has withdrawn support for PROFS.

 Absolute fidelity between an original document and the resulting doc-
 ument as printed or displayed by the receiving system is not guaran-
 teed. The differences between vendors' approaches to word processing
 systems, the transformations required for the transfer and printing
 of a document and the types of printer used may all affect the result-
 ing printed document.

 Since the introduction of this software, other configurations may have
 been tested. Please contact your local Digital office for up-to-date
