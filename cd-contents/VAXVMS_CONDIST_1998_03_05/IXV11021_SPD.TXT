                          Version 2.1

           DESCRIPTION

           The IXV11/VMS Driver allows programs written in any language
           supporting the MicroVAX/VMS $QIO System Service to commu-
           nicate with user devices connected to the IXV11/IXV1S mod-
           ules.

           The IXV11/IXV1S Module Family is a group of industrial dig-
           ital input/output, analogue input/output, and counter in-
           terfaces for Digital Equipment Corporation's Q-bus machines.

           IXV11/VMS Driver,                           SPD 28.28.02
           Version 2.1

           The following driver software functionality is available for
           control of the IXV1x interfaces. The driver allows any of
           the IXV1x interfaces to be either allocated by a single pro-
           cess or shared among several processes.

           o  Digital Input/Output requests support the following modes
              of operation:

              -  Read data from one or several IDV1x-A modules.

              -  Write data to one or several IDV1x-B or IDV1x-C mod-
                 ules.

              -  Read or write fractions of a 16-bit value.

              -  Interrupts can be handled in a user process by AST rou-
                 tines.

           o  Analog Input/Output requests support the following modes
              of operation:

              -  Read data from one or several (up to 128 different)
                 channels on IAV1x-A, -AA and IAV1x-C, -CA modules.

              -  Write data to one or several (up to 4 different) chan-
                 nels on IAV1x-B modules.

              -  Automatic gain selection can be enabled.

              -  Multiple reads on one channel can be initiated with
                 one request.

              -  Conversion can be started internally or externally.

                 Although the number of different channels is limited
                 to 128, it is possible to read each channel more than
                 once with one request. Therefore the actual number of
                 values that can be read is limited only by the length
                 of the control buffer.

           Version 2.1

           o  The Counter functions support the following modes of op-
              eration:

              -  Start or stop one or more (up to 5) counter channels
                 simultaneously on one IDV1x-D module.

              -  Counting upwards or downwards can be selected per chan-
                 nel.

              -  Every channel can be preset with an initial value.

              -  A counter overflow and/or underflow may be handled in
                 a user AST routine.

              -  Count of external events controlled by internal or ex-
                 ternal start signal.

              -  Count of selectable internal time intervals upon ex-
                 ternal control signal (time measurements).

              -  Concatenating consecutive counter channels.

           Note: This software product is supported in Europe only.
