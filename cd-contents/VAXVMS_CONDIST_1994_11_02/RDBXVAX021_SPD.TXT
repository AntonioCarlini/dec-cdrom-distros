 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC RdbExpert for OpenVMS VAX Systems   SPD 31.72.04
                Version 2.1A

 DESCRIPTION

 DEC RdbExpert for OpenVMS VAX Systems (RdbExpert) is a DECwindows Mo-
 tif[R] and character-cell based expert system database tuning tool de-
 signed to reduce the time and effort required to produce tuned DEC Rdb
 physical database storage designs. RdbExpert is intended to help database
 designers and administrators during the initial design and subsequent
 maintenance phases of database development. RdbExpert expands the tun-
 ing capabilities of less experienced database administrators while im-
 proving overall DBA tuning productivity.

 RdbExpert gathers information of importance encompassing logical level
 input related to physical design. RdbExpert bases its design recom-
 mendations on this logical schema information, as well as the system
 environment, database record volumes, and transaction workload infor-
 mation. RdbExpert makes extensive use of import functions, which en-
 ables users to quickly provide the required data. For example, RdbExpert
 can import DECtrace transaction workload data captured directly from
 running Rdb databases for use in the design process, thus creating de-
 signs based upon the actual workload executing against existing databases.
 The DBA then reviews this input and modifies it where necessary to en-
 sure an accurate reflection of the actual run-time requirements.

 RdbExpert generates storage designs in the form of the SQL Data Def-
 inition Language statements for DEC Rdb. It also generates executable
 storage design creation procedures as well as the DEC Rdb RMU/LOAD and
 UNLOAD scripts used to unload existing data and reload into the re-
 designed database. In addition,
 RdbExpert generates design reports to educate the DBA about the de-
 sign process and the database tuning rules.

 The RdbExpert knowledge base is cognizant of the DEC Rdb database sys-
 tem internals, tuning rules, and run-time optimizer heuristics. RdbExpert
 uses this knowledge to help the DBA arrive at the performance-tuned
 design.

 Features

 RdbExpert provides a DECwindows Motif interface, taking advantage of
 the advanced user interface capabilities of that environment. RdbExpert
 also provides a full-function, character-cell interface for non-DECwindows
 environments.

 Using RdbExpert, a database designer/administrator can:

 o  Import complete DEC Rdb database logical and physical schemas into
    the RdbExpert design repository from the DEC Rdb root file and SQL
    text file

 o  Enter the database transaction workload information using one or
    more of the following methods:

    -  Using application workload information captured by DECtrace

    -  Through a text file containing the DEC SQL-like Physical Design
       Language (PDL) created by the DBA

    -  Through SQL MODULE language files

    -  Through the DECwindows interface

 o  Append separate workloads

 o  View and edit the workload data modifying or entering cycle, fre-
    quency, and importance information for the various workload ele-
    ments of the database applications, that is, applications, programs,
    and transactions with their accompanying data manipulation language
    (DML) requests

 o  Segregate workload into dynamic and precompiled workloads in the
    same physical design

                                  2

 

 o  Enter the database volume and occurrence information by one or more
    of the following methods:

    -  From the DEC Rdb root file and tables

    -  Through a text file containing the volume information created
       by the DBA

    -  Through the DECwindows interface

 o  Apply volatility ratings (how frequently the data is added, mod-
    ified, or deleted) to the schema at both the relation (record) and
    column (field) levels

 o  Define system environment for the target database, including:

    -  Available space and priority ranking per disk

    -  AIJ and RUJ placement

    -  Segmented string storage partitioned across WORM optical devices

    -  Global buffers

    -  Device logical names and directories

    -  Uniform area thresholds for sorted indexes

 o  Catalog multiple logical designs, each with one or more physical
    designs with which it is associated

 o  Generate the design reports that identify the input assumptions and
    design information for the recommended parameters and database de-
    sign, as well as educate the user regarding the design rules and
    choices

 o  Generate a DECtrace statistics report

 o  Generate DEC Rdb logical and physical designs consisting of SQL log-
    ical and physical DDL, and creation and run-time parameters, as well
    as the Digital Command Language (DCL) procedure to execute these
    designs

 o  Validate logical and physical schemas when the Graphical Schema Ed-
    itor is installed

                                  3

 

 o  Create RMU/UNLOAD - LOAD scripts to unload and load the DEC Rdb data
    into the redesigned databases

 CONFORMANCE TO STANDARDS

 RdbExpert is based on DEC SQL which implements the American National
 Standard Database Language SQL. Refer to SPD 52.91.xx for a complete
 description of DEC SQL conformance to this and other standards.

               VAX-11/725, VAX-11/782,
               VAXstation 8000

 Processor Restrictions

 o  All processors require mass storage units to back up and restore
    established databases.

 o  All processors require a minimum of 8 MB of memory.

 o  All processors require a device for installation of the software.

                                  6

 

 o  ECO level 4 or later and WCS microcode version 123 or later are re-
    quired for VAX-11/780 or VAX-11/785 processors

 o  ECO level 3 or later required for VAX-11/750 processors

 Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1)

 Disk space required for    37,600 blocks
 installation:
                            (19 MB)

 Disk space required for    22,100 blocks
 use (permanent):
                            (11 MB)

 These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
 sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
 system environment, configuration, and software options. These counts
 are for the product software only. They do not include space for user
 data and files associated with product usage.

 Memory Requirements for DECwindows Support

 The minimum supported memory for this application running in a stan-
 dalone DECwindows environment with both the client and server execut-
 ing on that same system is 8 MB. However, the use of this software in
 conjunction with increased memory capability improves performance. The
 memory size suggested for most typical hardware configurations is 16
 MB.

 The performance and memory usage of DECwindows applications are par-
 ticularly sensitive to system configuration. Less memory may be re-
 quired on the client system (the system where the software is installed
 and executed) if the server (the component that displays the appli-
 cation) resides on another system. More memory may be required on a
 system with several applications running or where it may be desirable
 to improve the performance of an application.

          (Refer to SPD 33.45.xx)

 ____________________
 If   GSE is installed on the same system as RdbExpert, upgrading RdbExpert

   to version 2.1A requires that GSE also be upgraded to version 2.1A
