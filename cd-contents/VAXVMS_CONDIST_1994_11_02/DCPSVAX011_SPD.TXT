          DESCRIPTION

          DECprint Supervisor (DCPS) for OpenVMS is a family of layered prod-
          ucts that run on OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS AXP systems to provide ac-
          cess to selected PostScript [R] Level 1 and Level 2 print devices.

          The DECprint Supervisor family consists of the following products:

          o  DECprint Supervisor for OpenVMS, Base (DCPS-Base)-DCPS-Base drives
             Digital PostScript printers, and supports files formatted in PostScript
             and ANSI (DEC PPL3). It also supports these printers' special fea-
             tures, such as tray selection and two sided printing, and the mail-
             box option for the LPS32. DCPS-Base also allows PCL5 files to be
             printed on printers which have a native PCL5 interpreter. See the
             Other Hardware Required section of the SPD for specific models. The
             license rights to this product are included with the OpenVMS op-
             erating system.

          o  DECprint Supervisor for OpenVMS, Open (DCPS-Open)-DCPS-Open drives
             selected third party PostScript printers, and supports files for-
             matted in PostScript and ANSI (DEC PPL3). It also supports these
             printers' special features, such as tray selection and two sided
             printing. DCPS-Open allows PCL5 files to be printed on printers which
             have a native PCL5 interpreter. See the Other Hardware Required sec-
             tion of the SPD for specific models. The license rights for this
             product must be separately purchased.

                                                                  AE-PUM0C-TE

 



          DECprint Supervisor (DCPS) for OpenVMS,               SPD 44.15.02
          Version 1.1

             for both DCPS-Open and DCPS-Plus for advanced printing features for
             third-party printers.

          DECprint Supervisor software consists of the following components:

          o  A print symbiont that processes print requests from the host on which
             it resides.

          o  Communication software to transmit the request and associated data
             over the following protocols: Ethernet to a PrintServer printer via
             DECnet and TCP/IP using CPAP; AppleTalk over Ethernet or LocalTalk;
             LAT; serial line.

          o  Translators to convert non-PostScript files into the PostScript lan-
             guage for printing.

          o  Page formatting capabilities such as the ability to print multi-
             ple page images on a single side of a sheet of paper, and to spec-
             ify borders, margins, and page offsets.

          o  A series of PostScript tools for application developers. These in-
             clude a PostScript error handler and Font Encoding Vectors for the
             ISO Latin Alphabet Number 1 (ISO 8859/1) and Digital Multinational
             Character Set for use with all the PostScript text fonts that are
             built into Digital's PostScript printers.

          o  A collection of ALL-IN-1 Scripts and a WPS-PLUS Printer Table file
             that provide access to the many unique features of PostScript print-
             ers. Printing performance can be significantly improved for ALL-IN-1
             multiple selection and print operations. Support for LN03 and DE-
             Claser font cartridge emulation is included. This collection is pro-
             vided for ALL-IN-1 Versions 2.3 and 2.4 only. This capability is
             available only with DECprint Supervisor for OpenVMS VAX; it is not
             available with DECprint Supervisor for OpenVMS AXP.

          DECprint Supervisor software must be installed on each node that has
          print queues for PostScript printers. A DCPS-Open license must be in-
          stalled on each node that has queues which connect to third-party PostScript
          printers. However, systems providing printing through PATHWORKS servers
          to third-party printers are licensed through PATHWORKS for OpenVMS and
          do not need a separate DCPS-Open license. A DCPS-Plus license is also

                                           2

 



          DECprint Supervisor (DCPS) for OpenVMS,               SPD 44.15.02
          Version 1.1

          required for each node that has queues that take advantage of the DCPS-
          Plus features, whether they connect to Digital or third-party print-
          ers. To use the value added features with supported third party print-
          ers, you need both the DCPS-Open and the DCPS-Plus licenses.

          Note: PrintServer Software (SPD 49.09.xx) is required to make a PrintServer
          operational.

          Basic Printing Features

          Basic printing features are provided by DCPS-Base for Digital PostScript
          printers, and by DCPS-Open for third-party PostScript printers, within
          the limitations of the supported print devices. Not all basic features
          are available on all supported devices.

          Basic features include:

          o  PostScript printing. The print symbiont passes PostScript files di-
             rectly to the printer. DECprint Supervisor does not interpret or
             translate PostScript files. Therefore, they must be created using
             standard PostScript Level 1 or Level 2 operators as defined within
             the printer itself.

          o  DEC ANSI (PPL3) printing. DECprint Supervisor translates DEC ANSI
             (PPL3) files into PostScript for printing on the output device. These
             ANSI files may contain ASCII text, sixel graphics, and other fea-
             tures of Digital's ANSI-compliant Printing Protocol Level 3 (PPL3).

          o  Selection of input tray via INPUT_TRAY, SHEET_SIZE, or PAGE_SIZE
             parameters, and output tray via OUTPUT_TRAY, within the limitations
             of the printer and the tray-naming conventions to provide such fea-
             tures.

          o  Rotation of the page via the PAGE_ORIENTATION parameter for non-
             PostScript files only.

          o  Selection of single-sided, double-sided, or tumble printing when
             available on the printer, via the SIDES parameter.

          o  Formatting of ANSI text files via the /HEADER, /FORM, /SPACE, and
             /FEED qualifiers and the TAB parameter.

                                           3

 



          DECprint Supervisor (DCPS) for OpenVMS,               SPD 44.15.02
          Version 1.1

          o  Control of ANSI file margins, page setup, and wrap or truncate op-
             tions as specified by the DEFINE/FORM commands.

          o  Printing ANSI files with optional fonts via the FONTS_USED param-
             eter. (The optional fonts are available as a separately orderable
             SoftFonts kit.)

          o  Status and error messages sent to the user's terminal, printed on
             the job trailer page or job log page, written to a log file, or printed
             on the operator's console.

          o  Use of device control modules for basic data types via the /SETUP
             qualifier. PostScript modules may contain any PostScript operators
             supported by the printer in the printing context.

          o  Provide accounting information for each print job as follows: sheets
             of paper printed, the number of RMS Gets, and the number of QIO Writes.

          o  Provide access to the PCL 5 interpreter native to selected print-
             ers. Printers for which native PCL interpreter is supported are listed
             in the Other Hardware Required section of the SPD.

          o  Provides access to DCPS product features for printers with an Ap-
             pleTalk connection (this capability is not yet supported on Open-
             VMS AXP).

          o  Supports PrintServer printers on TCP/IP interconnects using CPAP
             protocol (requires TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS).

          Advanced Printing Features

          Advanced printing features are provided by DCPS-Plus for either Dig-
          ital or third-party PostScript printers, within the limitations of the
          supported print devices. Third-party printers still require the DCPS-
          Open license.

          Advanced features include:

          o  Automatic data type detection and switching. The software attempts
             to determine the data type of the file. If successful, it will au-
             tomatically translate, if necessary, and print the file. If it can-

                                           4

 



          DECprint Supervisor (DCPS) for OpenVMS,               SPD 44.15.02
          Version 1.1

             not determine the file data type, it will use the default data type
             defined by DATA_TYPE=AUTOMATIC.

             If the file is printed using the data type defined by DATA_TYPE=AUTOMATIC,
             the symbiont will look for a switch to PostScript command (%!) and
             continue to process the rest of the file as PostScript. This switch
             may occur only once per file. The switch to PostScript feature is
             disabled if DCPS uses the native printer interpreter to process the
             file.

          o  Printing non-PostScript data types on the PostScript printer. Trans-
             lators are provided to translate the following data types into PostScript
             for printing:

             -  DDIF (Bitonal Image subset only)

             -  PCL Level 4 (as implemented on the HP [R] LaserJet [R] IID)

             -  IBM [R] Proprinter [R] XL24

             -  ReGIS

             -  TEKTRONIX [R] 4010/4014

             -  ASCII LIST translator that formats and numbers ASCII files. This
                translator numbers each line of text, creates alternating bars
                of gray and white in the background, and creates a running head
                of the file name, and page number.

          o  Printing two or more page images on a single side of a sheet via
             the NUMBER_UP parameter.

          o  Specifying page layup features via the LAYUP_DEFINITION parameter.
             Page layup features include Borders, Margins, Margin Alternation,
             Pages Per Sheet, First Page, Page Order, and Page Grid. Layup def-
             inition options may be provided directly, as arguments to the LAYUP_
             DEFINITION parameter, or indirectly, as the contents of a file spec-
             ified by that parameter.

          o  Specifying a range of pages of the file to be printed via the PAGE_
             LIMIT parameter.

          DECprint Supervisor (DCPS) for OpenVMS,               SPD 44.15.02
          Version 1.1

          o  Automatically scaling a page created for one paper size so that it
             fits on a different paper size via use of both the PAGE_SIZE and
             SHEET_SIZE parameters on the same print command.

          o  Printing multiple (uncollated) copies of each sheet via the SHEET_
             COUNT parameter.

          o  Use of device control modules for all data types via the /SETUP qual-
             ifier. ANSI modules may include control sequences. PCL modules may
             include binary font data.

          o  Supports image printing on PrintServer printers (for printing of
             DDIF bitonal image files) taking advantage of the fastest image print-
             ing capabilities of the printer (PostScript Level 1, PostScript Level
             2, or Image PDL).

          DEC ANSI PPL3 (LN03 and DEClaser) Emulation

          Printing of ANSI text and sixel graphics is compatible with Digital's
          ANSI-compliant PPL3 printers (LN03 and the DEClaser family). Documents
          containing PPL3 font cartridge commands will be printed if the sys-
          tem has the appropriate optional SoftFonts kits installed, and the op-
          tional font modules are specified with the FONTS_USED parameter.

          Note: PostScript printers differ in the amount of virtual memory they
          have available for printing and font storage. Files which require down-
          loading of fonts may be printed differently, may print more slowly,
          or may fail to print, on some printers.

          Third-Party Printing Devices

          The DCPS-Open license extends to selected third-party PostScript print-
          ers the support equivalent to that provided for a similar Digital printer
          with the DCPS-Base license, within the limits of the third-party printer.

          The Other Hardware Required section of the SPD lists the supported third-
          party printers. Digital makes no representation relative to the use
          of this product to drive PostScript devices not listed in this SPD.
          The use of the DCPS-Open product to drive PostScript devices not listed
          on this SPD is not warranted nor supported.
