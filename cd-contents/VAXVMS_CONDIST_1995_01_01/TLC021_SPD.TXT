 PRODUCT NAME:  ALL-IN-1 IOS TeamLinks Connection V2.1  SPD 37.90.02
                       for OpenVMS VAX, V3.0A

 DESCRIPTION

 The TeamLinks Connection V2.1 (TLC V2.1) to ALL-IN-1 Integrated Office 
 System (IOS) V3.0A gives TeamLinks V2 clients extensive access
 to the ALL-IN-1 IOS V3.0A, enabling TeamLinks users to use ALL-IN-1
 IOS mail, documents, and directory services. The TLC V2.1 comprises
 a File Cabinet Server that gives comprehensive access to the
 ALL-IN-1 V3.0A file cabinet, the ALL-IN-1 Distributed Access server,
 licensing mechanisms, and the necessary system management required to
 manage the servers.

 The installation of the TLC V2.1 to existing ALL-IN-1 V3.0A systems re-
 quires that the OpenVMS VAX operating system, ALL-IN-1 V3.0, DECnet
 or TCP/IP, and Mandatory Update Patch A (MUPA - V3.0A) be installed
 prior to the installation of the TLC V2.1 - for details see below.
 The TLC V2.1 supercedes TLC V2.0 and may be installed on systems
 already running TLC V2.0, or on systems without.

 For new installations of ALL-IN-1 V3.0, the TLC V2.1 and MUPA are 
 shipped with the ALL-IN-1 V3.0A media kit and can be optionally 
 installed to support TeamLinks clients.

 The TLC V2.1 enables the TeamLinks Mail for Microsoft[R] Windows [TM] 
 V2.1 Client and the TeamLinks Mail for Macintosh[R] V2.0 Client users 
 to gain access to the following key services available on ALL-IN-1 
 V3.0 systems.

 Facilities available to the system manager via a VT interface or terminal

 the system manager to start and stop both the File Cabinet Server and 
 the ALL-IN-1 Distributed Access server. 

 When an ALL-IN-1 VT user transitions to the TeamLinks V2.* Client, the
 following restrictions apply:

 1. ALL-IN-1 V3.0A does not support all of the X.400 '84 attributes 
    available on the TeamLinks V2.* Client.

 2. TeamLinks for Windows V2.0 clients will not be able to receive new
    mail notification - for this capability they must be upgraded to
    TeamLinks for Windows V2.1. 

 The level of client service can be extended beyond what is offered via
 the TeamLinks V2.* Client. A full complement of Application Program-
 ming Interfaces (APIs) is provided to the ALL-IN-1 File Cabinet Server
 and ALL-IN-1 Distributed Access server for Application Developers.

 Operational Restriction

 A TeamLinks connection to ALL-IN-1 cannot be established if the Team-
 Links ALL-IN-1 account is based on an account where multiple ALL-IN-1
 users share a single OpenVMS account. Each TeamLinks user must have
 an individual ALL-IN-1 account.


  SOFTWARE LICENSING

 The ALL-IN-1 Client Services Access License for OpenVMS VAX
 -----------------------------------------------------------
 The ALL-IN-1 Client Services Access License enables TeamLinks V2.0 and 
 V2.1 clients access to the ALL-IN-1 V3.0A Integrated Office System 
 without incurring the cost of the full ALL-IN-1 V3.0A license.

 This license is ideal for customers wishing to add new TeamLinks V2.1
 users to existing ALL-IN-1 V3.0A systems on a Concurrent Use or Personal 
 Use license basis and to new installations of ALL-IN-1 V3.0A, with 
 ALL-IN-1 providing competitively priced and proven services to Windows 
 and Macintosh clients on a Concurrent Use, Personal Use or Tier Capacity 
 license basis.

 If a current ALL-IN-1 system is already licensed on a Capacity basis
 then no additional server license is required. Similarly, if the Team-
 Links user is already licensed to use ALL-IN-1 on a Personal Use ba-
 sis, then no additional server license is required. A new server li-
 cense is required only if the user is new to a non-Capacity licensed
 ALL-IN-1 system. See Table 1 above.

 The ALL-IN-1 Client Services Access License is limited to the current 
 capabilities of the TeamLinks V2.1 Windows and V2.0 Macintosh Clients,
 namely access to ALL-IN-1 IOS mail, file cabinet and directory services. 
 Subsequent versions of the TeamLinks Client will provide greater access 
 to ALL-IN-1 services.

 This license does not support end-user access from VTs or terminal 
 emulation mode UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. For capabilities greater than 
 those accessible from TeamLinks V2.* Clients, the full ALL-IN-1 IOS 
 license (see SPD 27.30.**) or the ALL-IN-1 Core Services license 
 (same SPD) is available.

 ALL-IN-1 Client Services Access license	QL-2DGA*-**

 *  Denotes variant fields. For additional information on available li-
    censes, services, and media, refer to the appropriate price book.


 To Support TeamLinks Clients on NEW Installations of ALL-IN-1 V3.0A

 New installations of ALL-IN-1 V3.0A supporting TeamLinks Clients require 
 at a minimum an ALL-IN-1 Client Services Access license (QL-2DGA*-**) 
 on a Concurrent Use, Capacity or Personal Use basis. For system management
 just one interactive system management connection from a VT or PC
 terminal emulation is provided with this license, and if other users are 
 nominated as system managers or administrators then at least one 
 ALL-IN-1 interactive license will need to be purchased. Appropriate 
 licenses are either QL-AAAAA-2B - the ALL-IN-1 IOS Personal Use license - 
 or QL-246AA-2B the less expensive ALL-IN-1 Core Services Personal Use 
 license. Concurrent Use licenses are not recommended for system
 management purposes.

 Media, documentation, and services are provided through ALL-IN-1 IOS
 V3.0A. See the ALL-IN-1 IOS and ALL-IN-1 Core Services V3.0 Software 
 Product Description (SPD 27.30.**) for further information.

 The TLC V2.1 does not of itself require a separate license.

 License Management Facility Support

 This layered product supports the OpenVMS License Management 
 Facility (LMF V1.1).

 For more information on the License Management Facility, refer to the
 OpenVMS VAX Operating System Software Product Description (SPD 25.01.xx)
 or the License Management Facility manual of the OpenVMS VAX Operating 
 System documentation set.


 Operational Restriction

 A TeamLinks connection to ALL-IN-1 cannot be established if the Team-
 Links ALL-IN-1 account is based on an account where multiple ALL-IN-1
 users share a single OpenVMS account. Each TeamLinks user must have
 an individual ALL-IN-1 account.

 WARNING: If it is intended to deploy TeamLinks for Windows V2.1 clients 
 it is strongly recommended that TLC V2.1 is installed to support them
 replacing TLC V2.0 as behaviour of the V2.1 client with TLC V2.0 is
 unstable and unpredictable and is not a supported option.

 Please note also:

 o  Every user of ALL-IN-1 IOS must be a registered OpenVMS and ALL-IN-1
    user. Upon acquiring the Concurrent Use or Personal Use ALL-IN-1 
    Client Services Access License, a new TeamLinks user must be 
    registered as such by the ALL-IN-1 system manager or administrator. 
    If no individual TeamLinks named user registration occurs, that user 
    will be denied access to ALL-IN-1 V3.0 by the TLC V2.1.

    New ALL-IN-1 systems purchased to provide services to TeamLinks V2.*
    Clients can be licensed on a Capacity license basis as well as on
    a Concurrent Use or Personal Use license basis.

 o  Non-TeamLinks Clients accessing ALL-IN-1 via the published APIs and
    the TLC V2.1 must also be registered OpenVMS and ALL-IN-1 users.
    For new users to a non-Capacity licensed ALL-IN-1 system a Services
    license of some description is required. See above.
