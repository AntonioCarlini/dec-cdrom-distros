 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC Computer Integrated Telephony       SPD 29.91.05
                Server for VMS, Version 3.0A

 DESCRIPTION

 DEC Computer Integrated Telephony (DEC CIT) Server for VMS is a soft-
 ware product that provides functional integration between Digital Equip-
 ment Corporation's computing environment and a CIT-compatible voice
 switch.

 This version of DEC CIT Server for VMS supports communications links
 to the following voice switches:

 o  The ASAI protocol for the AT&T(R) DEFINITY(R) Generic 3 (G3) PBX

 o  The HCI protocol on Mitel's SX2000[TM] PBX

 o  The Meridian Link[TM] (ISDN/AP) protocol on the Northern Telecom(R)
    Meridian[TM] 1 PBX

 o  The ACL/H protocol on the Siemens(R) HICOM[TM] 300 series PBXs

 o  Rolm(R) CBX, supporting the CSTA protocol

 o  Ericsson MD110, supporting the CSTA protocol

 Access to the CIT Server is through the DEC Computer Integrated Tele-
 phony Applications Interface (CIT Applications Interface). DEC CIT Ap-
 plications Interface provides programmers with an applications inter-
 face comprising a library of routines. These routines allow the ap-
 plications programmer to establish and control logical communications
 channels between a CIT client and a voice switch. These channels can
 be used for basic call processing such as making and accepting tele-
 phone calls, and additional call processing such as transfer and con-
 ference calls.

 Refer to the SPDs for the DEC CIT Applications Interface (for ULTRIX,
 VMS, and MS(R) Windows[TM]) for further details on the functions pro-
 vided.

 DEC CIT Server for VMS also supports communication with one or more
 DECvoice modules (North American version only).

 The CIT Server software resides on a VAX host. For voice switch func-
 tions, the VAX must be connected to a CIT-compatible voice switch by
 means of a synchronous communications link (Basic Rate Interface for
 the link to AT&T's switch). The CIT Server software communicates with
 the CIT-compatible voice switch and the CIT Applications Interface client
 nodes. It acts as an intermediary, passing messages between the voice
 switch and the CIT Applications Interfaces. For voice applications,
 one or more DECvoice modules must be installed on the CIT server node.
 The DECvoice hardware can be either the analog DTC04 option or the dig-
 ital DTCN5/DTC05 options.

 The following diagram illustrates an example of a DEC CIT configura-
 tion including the DEC CIT Server for VMS.

 Only experienced customers should attempt installation of this prod-
 uct. Digital recommends that all other customers purchase Digital's
 Installation Services. These services provide for installation of the
 software product by an experienced Digital Software Specialist.

                                  2

 

 If one or more DECvoice modules are required, the modules should be
 installed before the CIT Server software. The DECvoice system should
 be installed either by experienced customers or by Digital's Instal-
 lation Services. For more information, refer to the DECvoice Software
 Product Description (SPD 29.97.xx).

 In addition, if the link to a voice switch is required and the cus-
 tomer is not experienced with installing a CIT-compatible voice switch,
 the customer should consult their switch distributor.

 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

 Systems, components, and peripherals as specified in the System Sup-
 port Addendum (SSA 29.91.05-x).

 For a link to a voice switch, users must have a CIT-compatible voice
 switch configured to support the particular voice switch link proto-
 col. Support of DECvoice functions requires one or more DECvoice mod-
 ules.

 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

 o  OpenVMS VAX Operating System

 o  DECnet-VAX Phase IV (end-node or full function node license) if more
    than one VAX is part of the configuration

 o  VAX Wide Area Network (WAN) Device Drivers

    NOTE: The WAN Device Drivers Software is required if connecting the
    Server to any voice switch other than the AT&T DEFINITY PBX. It is
    not required for accessing the DECvoice functions.

 o  DEC CIT Applications Interface Software must be installed on ei-
    ther the same node as the DEC CIT Server software, or on another
    system linked to the CIT Server host (VAX, RISC, PC) by DECnet.

    The DEC CIT Server software can support multiple CIT Application
    Interfaces over DECnet.

 Refer to the System Support Addendum (SSA 29.91.04-x) for availabil-
 ity and required versions of prerequisite/optional software.

 In addition to Digital Equipment Corporation's software requirements,
 the software requirements for any voice switch connected to a CIT server
 must also be observed.
