 PRODUCT_NAME:  DECndu Plus, Version 1.0                
		DEChub Consolidated Firmware Kit V3.1

 DESCRIPTION

 The DECndu (Network Device Upgrade) Plus V1.0 utility allows users to
 update versions of software microcode resident in electrically alter-
 able memory within supported hardware devices. The DECndu Plus V1.0
 utility is installed on a load host and can be used to update the soft-
 ware microcode on eligible devices. DECndu Plus V1.0 implements two
 methods of updating eligible devices. SNMP/TFTP protocols are used to
 perform downline upgrades to Digital's DEChub 900 product family and
 other supported devices. DECndu Plus V1.0 also implements proprietary
 protocols used to downline upgrade the DECbridge 500/600 Series, DEC-
 concentrator 500, and DECbridge 90 products. This utility is avail-
 able only for those Digital products that have elected to use this method
 of updating. Refer to the appropriate product SPD for more informa-
 tion.

 The DEChub Consolidated Firmware Kit V3.1 contains the binary images which
 can be loaded to the appropriate DEChub products. This kit is submitted
 seperately.

 Features

 o  Installs and resides on an OpenVMS VAX

 o  Enables downline upgrading of device software microcode from the
    host into electrically alterable memory within the hardware device
    with a permanent update.

 o  Verifies load was successful at user option

 o  Adds SNMP/TFTP downline upgrade capability

 o  Is not LMF Compliant (No PAK required)

 DEChub 900 and GIGAswitch Support

 DECndu Plus V1.0 will perform software downline upgrades for DEChub
 900, GIGAswitch and associated modules. It will downline upgrade the
 DEChub 900 management module, DEChub functional modules (eg. repeaters) 
 located in a DEChub 900 slot or functional modules used as DEChub One 
 (standalone) devices. GIGAswitch and modular options are also supported.

 A downline upgrade target device must be addressable via an IP address
 in order for DECndu Plus V1.0 to perform an upgrade. Some modules may
 not implement direct IP addressing capability, and use an IP Services
 module. Downline upgrades of these modules need to be performed through
 the IP Services module, whether installed in the DEChub 900 or used
 as a DEChub One (standalone) device. Refer to the Firmware Release 
 Notes for specific Updating Instructions.

 Because SNMP and TFTP is used to downline upgrade these devices, an
 upgrade can be routed from anywhere in the network. The requirement
 to be on the same extended local area network (LAN) is removed from
 SNMP/TFTP operations.

 DECbridge 500/600 Series, DECconcentrator 500 and DECbridge 90 Sup-
 port

 For users of DECbridge 500/600, DECconcentrator 500 and DECbridge 90,
 device upgrades are made available via Software Upgrade kits (QB-*****-
 ** See Sales Update April 13, 1992). These QB kits contain DECndu V2.0
 (not DECndu Plus V1.0) and the device upgrade software. These devices
 are upgradeable only through RBMS and MOP protocols. DECndu V2.0, sup-
 plied with the Software Upgrade Kit, is sufficient for updating those
 devices.

 DECndu Plus V1.0 is a superset of DECndu V2.0, and as such also im-
 plements RBMS and MOP downline upgrading for the DECbridge 500/600 Se-
 ries, the DECconcentrator 500 and the DECbridge 90. If a user has DEC-
 ndu Plus V1.0 and one of these devices, DECndu Plus V1.0 will load the
 RBMS/MOP device as well. The user is not required to also install DEC-
 ndu V2.0 (even though it would have been received with the Software
 Upgrade Kit).

 RBMS/MOP based downline upgrade operations must occur on the same ex-
 tended LAN. The DECndu V2.0 or DECndu Plus V1.0 load host must be on
 the same extended LAN as the target device. An extended LAN is a col-
 lection of LANs that are interconnected by a network bridge device and
 logically appear as one large LAN.

 Note Regarding IP Capability:

 DECndu Plus V1.0 uses SNMP/TFTP to perform downline upgrade functions.
 For OpenVMS VAX systems, TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS VAX is a prereq-
 uisite software product.

 Alternative Upgrade Methods

 DECndu Plus was developed as a convenience to customers who wish to
 control the timing and execution of device upgrades. Since DECndu Plus
 implements standard SNMP and TFTP commands, some users may wish to write
 their own device upgrade procedures. DEChub firmware and a copy of the DECndu 
 Utility are also available  through the Internet at gatekeeper.dec.com in 
 /pub/DEC/hub900 using anonymous ftp. Reference the README file in this 
 directory for information on downline upgrading.
