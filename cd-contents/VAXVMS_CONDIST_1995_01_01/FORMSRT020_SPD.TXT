          PRODUCT NAME:  DECforms for OpenVMS VAX, Version 2.0   SPD 29.90.06

          DESCRIPTION

          DECforms for OpenVMS VAX is Digital's strategic software product for
          the development and deployment of forms-based user interfaces for in-
          teractive applications running on OpenVMS VAX systems. DECforms is a
          complete user interface management system (UIMS), providing applica-
          tions with not only the look-and-feel of a forms interface but also
          a robust set of dialog management and validation functions to control
          the user interface at application execution time.

          DECforms for OpenVMS VAX offers application programmers a set of form
          development tools for creating form-based user interfaces for the fol-
          lowing end user environments:

          o  Motif-based VAXstations and X terminals

          o  VT-based character cell terminals

          o  PostScript[R] printers

          Tools are also included for enabling application developers to upgrade
          existing VT-based DECforms applications to take advantage of the more
          powerful bitmap displays of Motif-based desktop devices.

          DECforms is based on the ANSI/ISO standard for a Form Interface Man-
          agement System (FIMS)(ISO Standard 11730). The Form Interface Manage-
          ment System is an industry software system and is not the property of
          any company or group of companies, or of any organization or group of
          organizations. DECforms for OpenVMS VAX offers a subset of the full
          functionality described by the CODASYL FIMS Journal of Development,
          with extensions tailored for the OpenVMS VAX environment.

          DECforms for OpenVMS VAX, Version 2.0                 SPD 29.90.06


          The fundamental principles underlying the FIMS model are embodied in
          DECforms:

          o  True Separation of Form and Function

          o  Efficient Distribution of Forms Processing

          o  Ease of Use

          o  Flexibility of User Interface Control

          o  Programming Language Independence

          One of the most powerful FIMS principles reflected in the DECforms ar-
          chitecture is complete separation of form and function. User inter-
          face processing is completely removed from the application program and
          totally isolated within the form itself. In DECforms, a form is not
          simply a collection of fields and background text describing the form's
          appearance. A DECforms form includes not just elements related to ap-
          pearance, but also data and procedural elements which control the pro-
          cessing of the user's interaction with the form. The application pro-
          gram is only concerned with the processing of data, not with the gath-
          ering and display of data at the user interface. This makes applica-
          tion programs much simpler to develop and easier to maintain and it
          also allows a single application to support multiple end user device
          environments with user interfaces tailored to the capabilities of the
          device and to the needs of the end user. In other words, a single ap-
          plication program can use DECforms to support users sitting at VTs with
          character cell-based forms as well as users sitting at Motif-based VAXs-
          tations with much more sophisticated bitmap forms.

          Forms are comprised of one or more panels which can be of any width
          and height (for VTs, panels must be no larger than the size of the phys-
          ical display device). If the data required to satisfy an application
          program's request cannot be physically or aesthetically fit onto a sin-
          gle screen, multiple panels can be defined within a single form to con-
          tain all the necessary fields and background text. Thus, a form can
          be as large as needed.

          When panels are displayed on the screen, they are displayed in view-
          ports (windows) which can be located any place on the screen. For VT
          devices, DECforms provides a complete windowing system to manage these
          viewports. For Motif-based devices, the services of the Motif window-
          ing system are used - each viewport is associated with a separate Mo-
          tif window. On VT devices, viewports are static - they cannot be moved
          by the user. On Motif devices, the user can move, resize and iconize
          viewports as needed. DECforms automatically displays and removes view-
          ports with their associated panels to gather and display all the data
          required by the application program.

          A form is described by the Independent Form Description Language (IFDL).
          The IFDL, while primarily declarational, includes procedural constructs
          as well. Field level control, screen navigation, panel management, and
          cross field and relational validations are among the many form pro-
          cessing activities which can be performed by the IFDL without the need
          to return to the application program.

          DECforms allows a single application to support multiple types of users
          with interfaces tailored to their particular end user environments,
          where those environments are differentiated by such factors as desk-
          top device and natural language. This tailoring is accomplished by uti-
          lizing another DECforms structure called a layout. Sets of panels tai-
          lored for a particular environment can be grouped together in a lay-
          out. A form can consist of multiple layouts, each tailored for a dif-
          ferent environment - for instance, one form can contain layouts for
          both VT devices and Motif devices as well as layouts for English users,
          French users, and German users. At run-time, DECforms chooses the one
          layout from within the form appropriate for the end user environment.

          The application program interacts with DECforms through a very sim-
          ple, six-call record-level interface. Either single or multiple records
          can be transferred in a single request.

          All field-level processing is performed by the DECforms Run-time Sys-
          tem, not by the application program. The DECforms Run-time System pro-
          vides a wide variety of form, panel, and field-level control and pro-
          cessing capabilities, including:

          DECforms for OpenVMS VAX, Version 2.0                 SPD 29.90.06


          o  Multiline text fields

          o  Simple arithmetic operations within the form

          o  Scrolled regions with the following characteristics:

             -  Vertical or horizontal scrolling

             -  Containing one- or two-dimensional arrays

             -  Partial or full-line scrolling

             -  Multiple lines per scrolled entry

          o  Conditionally protecting, highlighting, and concealing fields

          o  Changing video attributes dynamically based on real-time events

          o  Highlighting fields when the cursor is present

          o  Color support on VT241s and VT340s via mapping to video attributes

          o  Format Validations:

             -  Character Type

             -  Entry Required

             -  Minimum Length

             -  Full Field

             -  No Data Input

          o  Content Validations:

             -  Range Check

             -  List Check

          o  Context Validations:

             -  Against a general expression

             -  Cross-field validations

          o  Calling a user-defined routine (procedural escape routine) to per-
             form more complex validations, including file lookups.

          o  Built-in flexible field navigation capabilities on VTs allowing the
             operator to move among fields in any manner desired

          o  Timeouts on field entries

          o  Toggling between insert/overstrike mode

          For Motif devices, DECforms provides the following additional graph-
          ical user interface (GUI) control and appearance capabilities:

          o  Use of the mouse for random field navigation and other screen func-
             tions

          o  Full font and color support

          o  Push buttons

          o  Slider fields (scale widget)

          o  Horizontal and vertical scroll bars on data arrays, multiline text
             fields and panels

          o  Cut and paste text within fields, between fields, between panels,
             between windows

          o  Shadows and borders for 3D appearance

          o  Open and closed polylines with different line styles

          o  Grey scale fill patterns

          DECforms also provides an extremely flexible mechanism for defining
          functions and redefining keyboards to suit the operator environment.
          This includes support for multi-key function definitions. On Motif de-
          vices, chorded key functions are supported.

          DECforms supports most OpenVMS data types, which means that data type
          conversion does NOT have to be performed by the application program
          in most cases.

          DECforms can be used with VAX DATATRIEVE to provide powerful, window-
          like forms interfaces for queries and reports on data stored in RMS,
          VAX Rdb/VMS, and VAX DBMS files.

          Internationalization Features

          DECforms includes numerous internationalization features, allowing ap-
          plications to support user interfaces in multi-lingual environments.
          These features include:

          o  Multiple natural language layouts per form.

          o  International date formats.

          o  Numeric data formatting, including replacing decimal point with comma.

          o  Multiple character currency signs.

          o  Multiple character sets.

          o  Flexible positioning of fields and literals to allow for transla-
             tion.

          o  All messages are in OpenVMS Message Files to allow for translation.

          o  Integrated support for Hebrew language form development and pro-
             cessing, including right-to-left text path.

          Printing Support

          Through the use of the printing layout, DECforms provides the capa-
          bility for rendering high quality, bitmap hardcopy forms for print-
          ing on PostScript printers. The printing layout contains the speci-
          fication of a user interface which is output only and which specifies
          its output device as a file, rather than a physical device. This file
          can serve as input to other DDIF-capable applications, for ultimate
          printing or inclusion in compound documents.

          Through the use of the printing layout, DECforms also supports the con-
          cept of "batch printing" in which applications can use DECforms for
          high volume forms printing without the need for a physical display de-
          vice.

          Components

          Form Development Environment (FDE)

          DECforms for OpenVMS VAX, Version 2.0                 SPD 29.90.06


          The FDE allows a form designer to create a form interactively and pro-
          vides menus that help the designer step through various tasks of form
          creation and modification. The FDE is used with either the VT-based
          Panel Editor or the Motif-based Panel Editor to create the appearance
          of the form. The FDE also provides access to text editors, including
          the VAX Language-Sensitive Editor to allow a designer to write state-
          ments in the Independent Form Description Language (IFDL) that describes
          a DECforms form.

          Panel Editors

          The VT-based Panel Editor and the Motif-based Panel Editor allow the
          user to create graphic form elements in an interactive, "What You See
          Is What You Get" (WYSIWYG) fashion. The Panel Editors support the in-
          teractive creation of the visual elements of a form's panels: back-
          ground text and graphics, and the locations, sizes and attributes of
          fields.

          Independent Form Description Language (IFDL)

          The IFDL is a semi-procedural language that completely describes a DEC-
          forms form. It allows the form designer to create a form (non-interactively),
          specifying its appearance and functions. While the appearance of a form
          can be entirely created by the Panel Editors, procedural aspects of
          the forms, such as specialized responses to function keys and special-
          ized data validation, must be specified directly with IFDL statements.
          An IFDL source file is a text file that can be created or modified with
          any text editor.

          VAX Language-Sensitive Editor templates are available for the IFDL lan-
          guage to aid in the creation and maintenance of IFDL source code. DEC-
          forms also supports the Compile and Review capabilities of the VAX Language-
          Sensitive Editor.

          The IFDL also includes a COPY statement that provides for the copy-
          ing of record and field definitions from the Common Data Dictionary
          /Repository (CDD/Repository). DECforms supports CDD/Repository pieces
          tracking by depositing information in the dictionary indicating that
          a particular form has used a certain record. DECforms can also use CDD/Repository


                                           7

          records defined with the BASED ON attribute and those referenced through
          RDB$RELATIONS.

          IFDL Translator

          The IFDL translator compiles an IFDL source file into a binary form
          file. This form file is then ready for use with its application. Its
          appearance can be tested on a terminal screen or printed. The binary
          form file may be analyzed by other DECforms utilities, or edited in
          the FDE or the appropriate Panel Editor.

          Back Translator

          The Back Translator converts a binary form file into an IFDL source
          file. Essentially, it performs the reverse function of the IFDL Trans-
          lator. As a result, it provides a method of editing the IFDL source
          for a form created or modified by the FDE or Panel Editor. The IFDL
          source statements that the Back Translator produces also provide a com-
          plete textual description of the form.

          Extract Utility

          The Extract Utility performs three functions:

          o  Produces a printable representation of a form's panels from a form
             file.

          o  Creates object modules containing a form. These object modules can
             then be linked in an executable image with a program as a memory-
             resident form for use by the same program in a single session or
             in multiple sessions. The modules can also be linked in shareable
             images for use by multiple sessions from multiple processes.

          o  Produces an object module that contains pointers, or vectors, to
             procedural escape routines named in the form file. Escape routines
             are calls from the form to user-supplied subroutines created to do
             additional processing outside the form.

          DECforms for OpenVMS VAX, Version 2.0                 SPD 29.90.06


          The Test Utility allows certain aspects of the form to be tested sep-
          arately from its application program. It allows a form designer to check
          the appearance of a form's panels without having to write a program
          first.

          VT-to-Pixel Layout Converter

          The VT-to-Pixel Layout Converter takes as input a DECforms binary .FORM
          file containing a character cell layout and produces as output an .IFDL
          source file containing a pixel layout in addition to the original char-
          acter cell layout. The new layout is a "first-pass" pixel layout which
          will require some additional manual modifications to effectively take
          advantage of the additional characteristics of the pixel device, such
          as the use of the mouse and the full range of fonts and colors.

          VAX FMS Converter

          The VAX FMS Converter is a migration tool that converts a VAX FMS form
          or the forms in a VAX FMS form library into a DECforms IFDL source file.
          This process converts the appearance of the VAX FMS forms into a sim-
          ilar appearance described by the DECforms IFDL. The converter does NOT
          convert the application program or the User Action Routines associ-
          ated with the VAX FMS forms. The VAX FMS Converter works with forms
          created with VAX FMS V2.0 or later.

          VAX TDMS Converter

          A VAX TDMS Converter is available from Digital as a separately order-
          able product (order number QB-270AA-W* for the base package). This tool
          converts VAX TDMS forms and request definitions into DECforms IFDL.
          The tool also includes a COBOL translator for converting TDMS calls
          in a COBOL application program to equivalent DECforms calls.

          Sample Applications and Demonstration Forms

          The sample applications show how a form and an application program can
          interact. One of the samples includes a simple form with a few pan-
          els and a simple application program that makes requests of the form
          through the Form Manager. This introductory sample application is avail-
          able only in FORTRAN.

          DECforms for OpenVMS VAX, Version 2.0                 SPD 29.90.06


          The more complex sample application includes a form with many panels
          and many responses to various events as well as an application pro-
          gram that makes several requests of the form. This application is avail-
          able in Ada, BASIC, C, COBOL, DIBOL, FORTRAN, Pascal, and PL/I.

          In addition to the sample applications, the DECforms full development
          kit contains a package of demonstration forms, their sources, and a
          demonstration guide illustrating a number of the key features of DEC-
          forms.

          Form Manager

          The Form Manager is the interface between an application program and
          a display device. It is a run-time system that controls form display
          and operator input on terminals. The Form Manager provides six requests
          for communication between the form and the application. These requests
          (routines in the Form Manager) allow the application to enable the form
          for use, send data to the form, and receive data from it (separately
          or in one call), disable the form at the end of a session, or asyn-
          chronously cancel a request.

          The Form Manager is included with the DECforms Full Development Sys-
          tem and is also offered separately in the optional DECforms Run-time
          System. The only DECforms component available in this latter option
          is the Form Manager. The Run-time System allows the execution of ap-
          plications using DECforms on a machine other than the one used to de-
          velop the application.

          minals

          A special version of DECforms V1.4, shipped exclusively as part of the
          DEC SNA 3270 Application Services software, allows remote SNA-networked
          IBM 3270 terminal and PC users to access forms-oriented VAX applica-
          tions. This special version of DECforms provides users with additional
          features in the development tools to develop and maintain forms for
          display on 3270 class devices and a Run-time System that can gener-
          ate and interpret a 3270 data stream. This version of DECforms is not
          available as a standalone product and can only be used in conjunction

          An alternative to the use of the DECforms Form Development Environ-
          ment and Panel Editor tools is the use of DECadmire for generating DEC-
          forms IFDL source code. DECadmire is a prototyping and code generat-
          ing tool for DECforms timesharing and transaction processing appli-
          cations. DECadmire generates DECforms IFDL source code as well as COBOL,
          Pascal, and FORTRAN 3GL code, CDD/Repository code, SQL for databases,
          and VAX ACMS task and task group definitions. The DECforms Develop-
          ment kit is still required to produce a .FORM file, using the Form Trans-
          lator to take the .IFDL source file generated by DECadmire and trans-
          late it into a .FORM file, ready for use at application execution time.
          Refer to the DECadmire Software Product Description (SPD 52.65.xx) for
          more information.

          DECforms for OpenVMS VAX, Version 2.0                 SPD 29.90.06


          2. The VT131 is supported in VT102 mode only.

          3. DECforms does not support the use of the 25th status line nor the
             use of the locator device on VT300-series terminals.

          4. DECforms panels of up to 72 lines may be defined for VT420 termi-
             nals. The VT420 can display 24, 36, or 48 lines on a single screen.
             Panels consisting of a number of lines greater than the screen size
             can be panned under local hardware control by the VT420 terminal.
             DECforms does not support access to the F1-F5 function keys or to
             the ALTERNATE key. The COMPOSE key is supported when configured for
             LOCAL COMPOSE.

          5. DECforms supports display of forms on directly-connected IBM 3270-
             class terminals only when those terminals are connected to the CXM04
             3270 Terminal Option Card of a DECserver 550. This option card makes
             the IBM 3270-compatible device appear as a VT220 to the applica-
             tion.

          Terminal Emulators

          Terminal emulators on VAXstations and personal computers are supported
          only to the extent that the emulator conforms to the VT100, VT220, or
          VT320 environment it is emulating.

          Printers

          DECforms printing layouts can be converted to PostScript [R] files which
          can then be printed on any PostScript-capable printing device.

          DECforms character cell panels and forms can be printed on any Dig-
          ital printer. Video attributes are not printed and lines are drawn us-
          ing the characters "-", "+", " " rather than the line-drawing char-
          acter set.

          Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1):

          Full Development System

          Disk space required for      33,000 blocks
          installation:
                                       (16.9 Mbytes)

          Disk space required for      32,000 blocks
          use (permanent):
                                       (16.4 Mbytes)

          Run-time Only System

          Disk space required for      2,500 blocks
          installation:
                                       (1.3 Mbytes)

          Disk space required for      2,000 blocks
          use (permanent):
                                       (1.1 Mbytes)

          These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
          sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
          system environment, configuration, and software options.

          Memory Requirements for DECwindows Support

          The minimum supported memory for this application running in a stan-
          dalone DECwindows environment with both the client and the server ex-
          ecuting on the same system is 16MB.

          The performance and memory usage of DECwindows applications are par-
          ticulary sensitive to system configuration. Less memory may be required
          on the client system (the system where the software is installed and
          executed) if the server (the component that displays the application)
          resides on another system. More memory may be required on a system with
          several applications running or may be desirable to improve the per-
          formance of an application.

          For Workstations Running DECwindows:

          o  OpenVMS VAX Operating System V5.5-2 - 6.1

          o  DECwindows Motif V1.2 for OpenVMS VAX

          OpenVMS Tailoring:

          The following OpenVMS classes are required for full functionality of
          this layered product:

          o  OpenVMS Required Saveset

          o  Programming Support

          o  Utilities

          OPTIONAL SOFTWARE

          o  CDD/Repository for OpenVMS VAX V5.3

          o  DECset Release 11.2 for OpenVMS VAX

          o  Any programming language that conforms to the VMS calling standard.

          Note to users of VAX ACMS: This version of DECforms does not inter-
          operate with VAX ACMS V4.0 or earlier because this version of DECforms
          utilizes DECthreads, a threading architecture which is incompatible
          with the private VAX ACMS threading architecture. VAX ACMS-based ap-
          plications must utilize DECforms V1.4A for OpenVMS VAX, which is or-
          derable directly from Digital.
