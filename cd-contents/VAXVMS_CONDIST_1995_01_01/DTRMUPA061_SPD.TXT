 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC DATATRIEVE Version 6.1A for OpenVMS VAX Systems SPD
 25.44.25

 DESCRIPTION

 DEC DATATRIEVE for OpenVMS VAX systems is a query, report, and data
 management tool for the OpenVMS Operating System. It provides a uni-
 form access method for data stored by RMS, DEC Rdb, and DEC DBMS files
 on OpenVMS and data residing in other databases accessible by the Rd-
 bAccess products. Using DEC DATATRIEVE, a novice or experienced user
 can retrieve or modify data without considering the underlying stor-
 age method or physical location.

 Modes of Operation

 DEC DATATRIEVE presents information in several different formats. In-
 formation can be displayed using simple defaults or can be reported
 on through a more flexible report writer. Information can be displayed
 on a terminal or workstation, printed on a hard-copy device, or writ-
 ten to a file. Information can also be presented graphically with user-
 defined VAX FMS and VAX TDMS forms, as well as with DECforms. Graph-
 ics output is REGIS; it can be managed by devices or converters ac-
 cepting REGIS. DEC DATATRIEVE also provides an efficient way to ac-
 cess information stored on other VAX, AXP or PDP-11 systems linked by
 DECnet.

 DEC DATATRIEVE can be used interactively to retrieve, modify, store,
 or delete data using a simple set of commands. Frequently used com-
 binations of commands can be stored as named procedures and invoked
 by name. Programs written in other DEC languages can call DEC DATA-
 TRIEVE, allowing them to be independent of underlying data storage meth-
 ods and physical location.

                               DIGITAL                    March 1994

                                                         AE-PVM0A-TE

 

 A DECwindows Motif[R] interface to DEC DATATRIEVE is provided. This
 allows the user to perform a subset of the DATATRIEVE functions us-
 ing menu bars, scroll bars, pop-up menus, pull-down menus, and but-
 tons. The user can also use a navigator to browse through the meta-
 data in CDD/Repository, select objects, and execute commands on them
 directly from pop-up menus.

 Data Dictionary

 DEC DATATRIEVE is dictionary driven. Data descriptions are stored in
 and retrieved from CDD/Repository for OpenVMS. DEC DATATRIEVE includes
 commands to store, examine, modify, and delete definitions in the dic-
 tionary and can use definitions stored by other products, such as the
 DEC DBMS schema definitions or the DEC Rdb for OpenVMS database def-
 initions.

 DEC DATATRIEVE supports record and domain definitions in CDO format
 dictionaries, including the ability to access shareable fields. Pieces
 tracking is also supported for these entities. DEC DATATRIEVE includes
 full support for DMU format dictionaries as well.

 Protection

 Protection is handled by the CDD/Repository for OpenVMS. DEC DATATRIEVE
 can access data only through definitions in the CDD/Repository for Open-
 VMS. Locking the definition prevents the user from accessing the data.
 Access control with DMU format dictionaries can be based on name and
 login account, whereas with CDO format dictionaries access control is
 based on Access Control Lists. Additional control using the password
 or terminal class (local, remote, or dial-up) can be specified for DMU
 format dictionaries.

 Remote Data Access

 DEC DATATRIEVE provides access to data on remote VAX, AXP or PDP-11
 systems provided DATATRIEVE has been installed on the remote system.
 DEC DATATRIEVE uses the local data dictionary on the remote node and
 will divide processing between the host and the remote system to re-
 duce the traffic over the communications link.

                                  2

 

 For the Nonprogrammer

 DEC DATATRIEVE provides the novice user with a tutorial mode called
 GUIDE Mode.

 DEC DATATRIEVE offers ADT (Application Design Tool) for the more ex-
 perienced user who wants to define data structures. ADT takes the user
 step-by-step through the definition of a domain based on an RMS data
 file.

 If DEC DATATRIEVE is used on the same information by experienced and
 novice users, the novice user can use the full power of the language
 by invoking procedures designed by the more experienced user.

 For the Programmer

 DEC DATATRIEVE is a highly structured language that provides automatic
 access optimization, data type conversion, and data validation. Loop-
 ing and control structures, such as IF THEN ELSE, BEGIN END, REPEAT,
 WHILE, CHOICE and FOR (each record) can be combined and nested to cre-
 ate complex, powerful commands.

 DEC DATATRIEVE responds to programming errors with clear, explicit er-
 ror messages. The user can issue an EDIT command to invoke a text ed-
 itor with an erroneous statement as input text, correct the mistake,
 and resubmit the command. This editor can be either EDT, TPU, or DEC
 Language-Sensitive Editor (LSE) and is controlled by a user logical
 name assignment.

 Data Definition

 DEC DATATRIEVE stores the fixed attributes of each record in the record
 definition. In addition to COBOL-like attributes, DATATRIEVE allows
 validation criteria, fields whose values are computed at run-time, miss-
 ing value expressions, and default values.

 DEC DATATRIEVE supports most data types used by DEC FORTRAN, DEC COBOL,
 VAX PL/1, and DEC BASIC. DEC DATATRIEVE also supports Varying String
 and Segmented String data types in DEC Rdb for OpenVMS databases.

 Views

                                  3

 

 A VIEW is an alternative description of data. It can be used to al-
 low a user access to a subset of the data items in a record. It can
 restrict a user by including only some of the data items in a record,
 or it can combine data items from several files. Information can be
 linked through common values (or set linkages in DEC DBMS) to produce
 complex hierarchical structures. Using a predefined VIEW, a user can
 access and display data from several files at once with the same com-
 mands used on a single file. Data accessed through a VIEW can be printed
 and modified, but data cannot be stored or erased using a VIEW.

 Program Access

 DEC DATATRIEVE can be called from any language that supports the Open-
 VMS calling standard. DEC DATATRIEVE automatically converts data from
 its storage format to the format expected by the program. All of the
 features of interactive DEC DATATRIEVE are available through the call
 interface and use the same syntax.

 Storage Methods

 DEC DATATRIEVE uses a single, consistent syntax to provide full ac-
 cess to information stored in RMS for OpenVMS sequential or indexed
 files (RMS relative files are supported for queries only), DEC DBMS,
 and DEC Rdb databases. DEC DATATRIEVE can also provide access to in-
 formation stored in certain IBM[R] mainframe databases, through the
 use of DEC RdbAccess for DB2[TM], as well as information stored in OR-
 ACLE[R] databases through DEC RdbAccess for ORACLE. Data from all these
 sources can be combined into a single VIEW.

 If access to a DEC DBMS database involves explicit set walking or if
 records must be manually connected or disconnected from sets, the user
 can employ DEC DATATRIEVE language features that are specific to DEC
 DBMS access. However, if the user employs VIEWS or implicit set walk-
 ing, DEC DATATRIEVE can access information in DEC DBMS databases us-
 ing the same syntax used for data from an RMS file.

 Report Generation



                                  4

 

 The DEC DATATRIEVE REPORT statement can produce simple formatted re-
 ports without formatting statements. It also allows the user to over-
 ride the default format when more complex reports are required. Re-
 ports can either be page-based, printable documents, or table-based
 formatted data that can be input by a spreadsheet.

 Column headers and, in page-based reports, page headers containing ti-
 tle, date, and page numbers are produced automatically. Simple state-
 ments (AT TOP, AT BOTTOM) create page headers and trailers for con-
 trol breaks, page breaks or a report summary. DEC DATATRIEVE provides
 all of its statistical functions and value expressions within the RE-
 PORT statement.

 Reports can be output in a variety of output formats: table reports
 are produced in DTIF format, and page-based reports in DDIF, Postscript[R]
 and Text formats. Usage of DDIF and Postscript allows a variety of text
 attributes (size, font types, rendition) to be applied to any part of
 the report to obtain a boardroom-quality output. These attributes, and
 other printing characteristics such as page size and orientation, can
 be selected from DEC DATATRIEVE through simple statements without re-
 quiring the use of a graphical terminal. Simple character-cell based
 reports are also available, using the Text format. Using the CDA con-
 verter library, DTIF and DDIF reports can be converted to a variety
 of output formats, allowing interoperability with a number of popu-
 lar applications.

 The Report Writer provides two layout tools: a grid printout of the
 CDA report layout with placement of rows and columns, including those
 with varying font types, and graphical printout of the layout page,
 with placement of the different report objects (such as header, footer,
 body)

 Reports can be generated from data stored in DEC RMS files, DEC DBMS
 and DEC Rdb databases, certain IBM mainframe databases accessed through
 the use of DEC RdbAccess for DB2 or DATATRIEVE VIEWS that combine any
 of these without any change in the syntax of the REPORT statement.

 Graphics


                                  5

 

 DEC DATATRIEVE includes a number of predefined plots invoked with a
 single command that takes standard record selection expressions as ar-
 guments and creates bar, pie, line, and scattered point plots of the
 information selected. Plots can be displayed on Digital Equipment Cor-
 poration Graphics terminals such as the VT340 (refer to the OPTIONAL
 HARDWARE section for a list of specific supported terminals). Hard copy
 can be obtained from terminals by attaching a Digital device which sup-
 ports the SIXEL protocol (for example, LA50, LA75). For users with DECwin-
 dows, graphics can be displayed in DECterm windows.

 Compatibility

 DEC DATATRIEVE is largely upward compatible from DATATRIEVE-11. DATATRIEVE-11
 provides a utility that extracts the contents of a DATATRIEVE-11 dic-
 tionary in a format to be entered into CDD/Repository for OpenVMS. Some
 syntactic and semantic differences do exist between DATATRIEVE-11 and
 DEC DATATRIEVE. Procedures copied with the EXTRACT utility can require
 modification.

 DEC DATATRIEVE for OpenVMS VAX systems and DEC DATATRIEVE for Open-
 VMS AXP systems are highly compatible, with the exception of the sup-
 port for floating point definitions typical of the AXP platform.

 Processor Restrictions:

 A TK50 Tape Drive is required for standalone MicroVAX 2000 and VAXs-
 tation 2000 systems.

 Other Hardware Required:

 Mass storage with a minimum of 25,000 disk blocks for DEC DATATRIEVE
 system software for VAX Systems.

 Disk Space Requirements (Block Cluster Size = 1):

 Disk space required for    30,000 blocks
 installation:
                            (15.3 Mbytes)

 Disk space required for    20,000 blocks
 use (permanent):
                            (10.2 Mbytes)

 These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
 sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
 system environment, configuration, and software options.

 Memory Requirements for DECwindows Support:

 The minimum supported memory for this application running in a stan-
 dalone DECwindows environment with both the client and server execut-
 ing on that same system is 8M bytes.

 The performance and memory usage of DECwindows applications are par-
 ticularly sensitive to system configuration. Less memory may be re-
 quired on the client system (the system where the software is installed
 and executed) if the server (the component that displays the appli-
 cation) resides on another system. More memory may be required on a
 system with several applications running, or where it may be desir-
 able to improve the performance of an application.
