 PRODUCT NAME:  VAX COBOL GENERATOR, Version 1.4        SPD 27.16.05

 DESCRIPTION

 VAX COBOL GENERATOR is developed by Touch Technologies, Inc. and dis-
 tributed under Digital Equipment Corporation's standard terms and con-
 ditions.

 VAX COBOL GENERATOR is a screen-oriented program generator that pro-
 duces VAX COBOL source programs. Commercial programmers use the VAX COBOL
 GENERATOR as a productivity tool for the creation and maintenance of
 data processing applications. The programmer can create or modify a
 program by choosing icons that represent the components making up the
 program (menus, screens, etc.). From this input, the VAX COBOL GEN-
 ERATOR produces a VAX COBOL source program that can be used like any
 other source program. Also, the VAX COBOL GENERATOR can be used for
 rapid prototyping to produce a program that can later be expanded and
 refined to become a production application. Thus, programmers can pro-
 duce and maintain VAX COBOL programs in much less time than by tra-
 ditional hand coding.

 The VAX COBOL GENERATOR runs under the VMS Operating System. The VAX
 COBOL GENERATOR can produce programs that call subprograms written in
 other VMS languages, as well as many Run-Time Library routines and sys-
 tem services. Similarly, programs produced by the VAX COBOL GENERA-
 TOR can be called by other VMS products adhering to the VAX Calling

 Standard. The default screen interactions utilize the VAX COBOL ex-
 tensions to the ACCEPT and DISPLAY statements. However, the VAX COBOL
 GENERATOR can produce screen applications that use other screen pack-
 ages, such as VAX FMS (Forms Management System). These VAX COBOL source
 programs can be debugged by the VAX Symbolic Debugger.

 To define an application in the VAX COBOL GENERATOR environment, the
 programmer selects and places icons (representing various parts of the
 application) in the screen work area for expansion. Data and proce-
 dural flow are specified by connecting these parts together. The VAX COBOL
 source code generated is then compiled by the VAX COBOL language pro-
 cessor and linked by the VAX Linker. These applications can then be
 executed on any valid VMS Operating System.

 Features

 The VAX COBOL GENERATOR lets the application be defined in a "top-down"
 manner. The programmer defines and manipulates the high-level design
 of the program parts (nodes) and the relationship between those parts
 (connections) and supplies more detailed information by using inter-
 active forms and editors.

 There are icons for each of the following data type nodes that rep-
 resent the data used in the application:

 o  File - Defines a file (any RMS file or Rdb database accessible from
    VAX COBOL) to be accessed in the application.

 o  Form - Defines the layout of a form to be used in the application.

 o  Report - Defines the layout of a report to be generated by the ap-
    plication.

 o  Local Storage - Defines data used in the application, but not stored
    in a file.

 There are icons for each of the following procedural type nodes that
 represent the specific functional tasks performed in the application:

 o  Menu - Creates a menu in the application.

                                  2

 

 o  Procedure - Defines a procedure to be executed in the application
    that can be either predefined (for example, SORT) or customized VAX
    COBOL source code produced by the application designer using an ed-
    itor.

 o  Data Movement - Defines the movement of data from one data node to
    another (for example, accepting data from a form into a file).

 A group node (icon) is a structural node that represents a complex func-
 tion at a high level as a single node. Later, in the application de-
 sign, the node is expanded to include the specific data type and pro-
 cedural type nodes for that particular complex function.

 The VAX COBOL GENERATOR provides a data dictionary that allows the pro-
 grammer to store common data definitions. This provides a single point
 of control so that data elements used in a single, or multiple, ap-
 plication need only be changed once. The applications can then be re-
 generated to incorporate the changes. Optionally, VAX CDD record def-
 initions can be used.

 Libraries are another single point of control for changes. Form, file,
 local storage, report, and procedure node definitions (with the ex-
 ception of SORT and MERGE procedures), as well as data dictionary, can
 be stored in a library and referenced from multiple programs.

 In a DECwindows environment, VAX COBOL GENERATOR can be executed un-
 der the DECwindows Terminal Emulator.
