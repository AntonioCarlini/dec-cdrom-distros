 PRODUCT NAME:  CDD/Repository Version 5.3 for OpenVMS VAX Systems SPD
 25.53.22

 DESCRIPTION

 CDD/Repository for OpenVMS VAX Systems is an active, distributed repos-
 itory system that provides the capabilities for users to organize, man-
 age, control and integrate tools and applications across the entire
 enterprise. CDD/Repository is the foundation of Digital Equipment Cor-
 poration's COHESION Environment and a component of Network Applica-
 tion Support (NAS). It is an evolutionary outgrowth of the earlier CDD/Plus
 data dictionary and is now able to provide the data integration ca-
 pabilities required in software development environments.

 New repository information management features are equally applica-
 ble to complex software code development projects as to database schema
 definition and modification over time. CDD/Repository provides both
 CASE and data management disciplines.

 Information Management Features

 Common View of Information

 CDD/Repository for OpenVMS provides a storage area for common elements
 and methods that can be accessed and shared by multiple applications.
 Use (and re-use) of common elements saves development time.

 Consistency of Information

 When multiple applications use the same elements and methods, redun-
 dant information and conflicting definitions can be eliminated. CDD/Repository
 includes a notification system that alerts users to changes made to
 related elements. Users can also check the effects of a projected change
 before the change is made.

 Distribution of Information

 CDD/Repository for OpenVMS VAX Systems is designed to allow customers
 to treat multiple physical repositories as one logical repository span-
 ning multiple devices in a network. Users can transparently access repos-
 itories on different devices on a single node and on different nodes
 on a local or wide area network. Repositories can be organized accord-
 ing to the needs of a corporation, and definitions can be managed ei-
 ther centrally or locally. Users can switch from one physical repos-
 itory to another and gain access to definitions in any of the repos-
 itories the user can access.

 Extensible Information Model

 The CDD/Repository Information Model contains a base set of elements,
 behaviors, and relationships that span all phases of the software de-
 velopment process. This allows users to model, manipulate, and con-
 trol aspects of product and process as development occurs.

 The Information Model is implemented in the form of an object-oriented
 type hierarchy. This form is designed to reduce the amount of infor-
 mation that must be explicitly stated in application code.

 The CDD/Repository Information Model can be extended to create addi-
 tional elements, behaviors, and relationships. This functionality al-
 lows users to customize (extend) the information model to integrate
 applications and tools, or to address business-specific needs. Exten-
 sions can be done using the CDD/Repository call interface or by use
 of a companion product, CDD/Administrator.

 Environment Management Features

 Configuration Management

 Configuration Management is tailored to the needs of groups working
 on complex development efforts. It provides for multiple versions of
 system elements, multiple versions of system configurations, and vari-
 ant lines of development.

 Context Management

 Context Management allows users to switch between activities equated
 to project tasks, and to maintain the current state of each activity.

 User-Designed Approval Structures

 These structures allow users to promote system elements to higher lev-
 els (and wider visibility) as they become more stable or meet spec-
 ified criteria.

 Version Management

 This capability allows users to track versions of work products and
 to manage the concurrent creation of new versions by multiple users.
 Multiple variants of an object can be created and merged back together
 into a single version.

 Pieces Tracking and Notification

 Pieces Tracking makes it possible to locate all uses of a shared def-
 inition. This facilitates impact analysis and planning for the imple-
 mentation of changes.

 The Notification mechanism delivers a notice that a definition has been
 changed to any user or application that accesses a copy of the def-
 inition.

 Data Security and Integrity

 CDD/Repository for OpenVMS VAX Systems provides the capability to grant
 or deny access rights to repository definitions. The CDD/Repository
 protection provisions for definitions are consistent with OpenVMS pro-
 tection schemes.

 Utilities/Interfaces

 Common Dictionary Operator (CDO) Utility

 The CDO Utility is the command line interface to CDD/Repository, where
 users can accomplish data description and repository management func-
 tions. The CDO Utility supports the OpenVMS style of command entry.
 A flexible menu-driven editor allows users to create new field and record
 definitions and to browse through previously-defined field and record
 definitions.

 CDO can be used to define any type of object included in the CDD/Repository
 information model including objects defined as extensions to the Digital-
 provided information model.

 Verify Utility

                                  4

 

 The Verify Utility confirms and optionally restores the integrity of
 a repository.

 Call Interface

 System programmers, software engineers, and experienced application
 designers can directly invoke the object-oriented callable interface
 to CDD/Repository from user programs. Through this interface, appli-
 cations call procedures to send messages that affect repository el-
 ements. Using the call interface allows users direct access to repos-
 itories without using the CDO Utility. Documentation
