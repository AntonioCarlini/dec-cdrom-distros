 PRODUCT NAME:  OSI Application Developer's Toolkit     SPD 34.98.05

 DESCRIPTION

 The OSI Applications Developer's Toolkit enables users to write dis-
 tributed applications that communicate over open networks and use the
 OSI services provided by DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS on VAX and AXP sys-
 tems, DEC OSF/1[R] on AXP, and ULTRIX on MIPS platforms.

 The Toolkit provides an application development environment which con-
 sists of:

 o  an interface to FTAM (File Transfer, Access and Management)

 o  interfaces to the ACSE (Association Control Service Element) and
    Presentation layers

 o  an interface to ROSE (Remote Operations Service Element) (OpenVMS
    VAX, OSF/1, and ULTRIX platforms)

 o  support for OSI TP (Transaction Processing) (OpenVMS and OSF/1 plat-
    forms)

 o  ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) Tools (OpenVMS and OSF/1 plat-
    forms)

 o  example programs

 and permits the application writers to use the services of the OSI up-
 per layers in their applications.

 The Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provide access to the
 OSI services supported by the underlying DECnet/OSI system.

 The ASN.1 Tools provide a compiler and utilities that allow the user
 to build a library of encode/decode routines.

                               DIGITAL                 November 1994

                                                         AE-PJA3F-TE

 

 The Toolkit allows for the development of applications on all three
 systems; source code must be compiled and linked with the Toolkit on
 each operating system. The Toolkit is required on the development sys-
 tem and the compile/link system. The resulting application can be run
 on any DECnet/OSI system with the appropriate operating system. The
 Toolkit is not required on these target systems unless the applica-
 tion is using OSI TP.

 The current Toolkit versions are:

 o  OpenVMS VAX: Version 2.0

 o  OpenVMS AXP: Version 2.2

 o  DEC OSF/1 AXP: Version 2.2

 o  ULTRIX RISC: Version 1.1

 Standards Supported

 FTAM

 FTAM supports the OSI standard

 o  ISO 8571-Information Processing Systems-Open Systems Interconnection-
    File Transfer, Access and Management.

 The FTAM API provides the interface to the FTAM protocol machine pro-
 vided in DECnet/OSI. Communications between the application code and
 the FTAM protocol machine are carried out using ASN.1 encoded data struc-
 tures. The API supports the following functions:

 o  Abort

 o  Begin-Group

 o  Cancel

 o  Change-Attributes

 o  Create

 o  Close

 o  Data

 o  Data-End

 o  Delete

 o  Deselect

 o  End-Group

 o  Initialize

 o  Open

 o  Read-Attributes

 o  Read

 o  Select

 o  Terminate

                                  4

 

 o  Transfer-End

 o  Write

 ACSE

 The Association Control Service Entity (ACSE) API supports the OSI stan-
 dards

 o  ISO 8650-Information Processing Systems-Open Systems Interconnection-
    Protocol Specification for the Association Control Service Element

 o  ISO 8649-Information Processing Systems-Open Systems Interconnection-
    Service Definition for the Association Control Service Element

 The ACSE API provides the interface to the Associate and Release ser-
 vices. The services provided are

 o  Associate

 o  Release

 o  Abort

 o  Redirect

 The Redirect service is not an ACSE service. It allows applications
 to redirect an incoming association to another process on the local
 system.

 Presentation

 The implementation of the Presentation layer in the Toolkit supports
 the OSI standards:

 o  ISO 8823-Information Processing Systems-Open Systems Interconnection-
    Connection Oriented Presentation Protocol Specification

 o  ISO 8822-Information Processing Systems-Open Systems Interconnection-
    Connection Oriented Presentation Service Definition

 o  ISO 8327-Information Processing Systems-Open Systems Interconnection-
    Basic Connection Oriented Session Protocol Specification

                                  5

 

 o  ISO 8326-Information Processing Systems-Open Systems Interconnection-
    Basic Connection Oriented Session Service Definition.

 The Presentation API provides the interface to the Presentation layer
 services and, by pass through, to the equivalent Session layer ser-
 vices. The API supports the following services:

 o  Alter-Context

 o  Data

 o  Capability-Data

 o  Expedited-Data

 o  Typed-Data

 o  Token-Please

 o  Token-Give

 o  Control-Give

 o  Sync-Major

 o  Sync-Minor

 o  Resynchronize

 o  Exception-Report

 o  Activity-Start

 o  Activity-Interrupt

 o  Activity-Resume

 o  Activity-Discard

 o  Activity-End

 o  Abort

                                  6

 

 The Session layer supports ISO Session Version 1 and Version 2. Ses-
 sion version 1 allows up to 512 octets of user data on a service. Ses-
 sion version 2 supports the restrictions imposed by the National In-
 stitute of Standards and Technology allowing up to 10,240 octets of
 data on a service.

 ROSE

 The Remote Operations Service Element (ROSE) supports the OSI stan-
 dard:

 o  ISO 9072 - Information Processing Systems - Text Communications -
    Remote Operations

 ROSE supports interactive applications in a distributed open systems
 environment. It is a service for multivendor distributed processing.

 The ROSE functionality provides a mechanism which allows for the en-
 coding and decoding of the Remote Operations Protocol Control Infor-
 mation, as defined in ISO 9072, for the following services:

 o  Invoke

 o  Result

 o  Error

 o  Reject

 OSI TP

 The OSI TP component of the Toolkit supports the OSI standard

 o  ISO/IEC 10026-Information Technology-Open Systems Interconnection-
    Distributed Transaction Processing (OSI TP)

 OSI TP resides at the Application layer of the OSI Reference Model.
 It provides sufficient facilities to support transaction processing
 among two or more open systems. It can also be used as a communica-
 tions subsystem connecting distributed applications involved in peer-
 to-peer communications in an OSI environment (that is, with no need
 for transaction processing).

                                  7

 

 The OSI TP component supports the following functions:

 o  Dialogue

 o  Shared Control

 o  Polarized Control

 o  Handshake

 The OSI TP component does not currently support the transactional func-
 tional units. 


 ASN.1

 The Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) compiler is based on the fol-
 lowing OSI standards:

 o  ISO 8824-Information Processing Systems-Open Systems Interconnection-
    Specification of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)

 o  ISO 8825-Information Processing Systems-Open Systems Interconnection-
    Specification of Basic Encoding Rules for Abstract Syntax Notation
    One (ASN.1)

 The ASN.1 compiler is capable of processing the full syntax specified
 in ISO 8824 (v1988 and v1990) without any additional or special aug-
 mentations to the syntax. Macros are fully supported by the compiler.
 In addition to the compiler, there are four core components:

 o  buffer management

 o  encoding protocol

 o  decoding protocol

 o  protocol tracing

 The compiler produces a "C" header file that provides a "C" represen-
 tation of the ASN.1 structures and PDU definitions. Compile time op-
 tions select either a space optimized (table driven) or a time opti-
 mized (generated in line code) variant of C-source output, however the
 "C" header file remains the same in both cases.

                                  8

 

 The compiler and associated run-time components are terminal line mode
 based. The interfaces are provided for the compiler and associated run-
 time components.
