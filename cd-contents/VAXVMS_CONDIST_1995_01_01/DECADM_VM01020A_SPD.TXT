 PRODUCT NAME:  DECADMIRE V2.0                          SPD 52.65.00

 DESCRIPTION

 DECADMIRE is an application development tool that generates high-performance,
 large-scale production applications. DECADMIRE is used to create full
 client/server and transaction processing implementations across het-
 erogeneous systems, standard timesharing applications, or continuous
 fault tolerant applications in the OpenVMS environment.

 Rapid development takes place using the prototyping, automatic screen
 generation, and code generation facilities. DECADMIRE provides an en-
 vironment for the application developer to describe and define the database,
 and the appearance of application screens, menus, and reports in the
 DECADMIRE BUILDER.

 Individual components of the application (screens, reports, and menus),
 or the entire application can be tested using prototyping. The appli-
 cation's source code is generated by the DECADMIRE GENERATOR. Specific
 customizations for the application can be manually entered into the
 generated code and are preserved for regeneration. Future maintenance
 of the application can take place in DECADMIRE or directly in the gen-
 erated application code.

 Components Overview

 DECADMIRE has two major components that allow the user to create an
 application: the DECADMIRE BUILDER and the DECADMIRE GENERATOR.

 DECADMIRE BUILDER



                               DIGITAL                     June 1994

                                                         AE-Q4CQA-TE

 

 Using DECADMIRE BUILDER, the application developer interactively de-
 scribes the database structure of the application, screen, and report
 designs. Existing data definitions can be imported or cloned into DECAD-
 MIRE. The prototyping environment enables the application to be used
 interactively with real data. The application can be tested and re-
 viewed with the end users confirming that the application meets their
 needs prior to any code generation. Online help can be added to the
 screens during application development.

 DECADMIRE GENERATOR

 The source code for the application is produced by the DECADMIRE GEN-
 ERATOR. The result of this generation is an integrated application based
 on code for standard Digital layered products. This code can be mod-
 ified, enabling additional features or customizations to be added to
 the application. The code contains markers, which represent portions
 of the code that will be updated during regeneration from changes made
 in the DECADMIRE BUILDER. Modifications to the code should be placed
 outside of these markers. The latest version of the source code can
 be used for regeneration, capturing all customizations.

 DECADMIRE GENERATOR produces COBOL, Fortran, Pascal, and DEC C code,
 complete DECforms code, full exchange or single step ACMS tasks, client
 file for PC development, a CDD dictionary, a test Rdb database, and
 ACMS task group and application definition file (for the ACMS-specific
 applications). In addition, production reports and user handbook doc-
 umentation can be generated.

 Components Detail

 Database Design/Description

 DECADMIRE allows the user to start either by importing database in-
 formation into the dictionary or manually entering this information
 using the dictionary maintenance facility. A review of all informa-
 tion entered or imported should be completed with either the dictio-
 nary maintenance tool or reports before continuing prototyping and code
 generation.


                                  2

 

 Relationships among tables are defined by associating like data items,
 which comprise parent-child and related table descriptions. All screen
 development, report development, prototyping, and code generation are
 based on the dictionary information. A copy table function is provided
 to enhance development efforts. Application Design

 Each function performed by the application is designed as a module.
 Each module is associated with predefined templates, which associate
 a specific series of actions to be processed within the application.
 A module can be a screen for data entry, inquiry, menu, report, or an
 update module used to update data not specific to the activated screen.

 For client/server development with TFM or a third-party client tool,
 a companion module must be defined.

 The following components are included in the application design and
 description:

 o  Panel maintenance identifies the panels used by the specific mod-
    ule within the application. Any of the following can be assigned
    to the module:

    -  Key panel, enabling data entry into key fields.

    -  Select panel, allowing record selection based on the value en-
       tered in a particular field, and having those values passed back
       to the form based on the criteria.

    -  Field panel, enabling the main area of data entry.

    -  Extension panel, allowing for extended input of field entry, with
       a maximum number of eight per module.

    -  Function panel, enabling the definition of application actions
       versus the specific use of function keys.

 o  Screen painting uses the screen editor to describe the fields, free
    text, grouping of fields, and action among the fields and modules.

 o  Automatic screens can be generated from a table in three style vari-
    ations:

    -  Two-column format for left-to-right data entry

                                  3

 

    -  Two-column format for top-down data entry

    -  Multiple columns across with the field labels above the field

 o  The module copy feature copies not only the module contents, but
    also the action/processing from the copied module into the new mod-
    ule.

 o  Application messages can be tailored for each module.

 o  Menus are defined using the menu design painter including support
    for:

    -  Labeling of menu headers

    -  Quick labels for moving around the application

    -  Entry of documentation for user's guide handbook

    -  Main menu and submenu support

 o  RTR routing key maintenance (COBOL only)

    -  Definition of an RTR routing key for a dataset to be used by an
       RTR server

    -  Definition of an RTR key value to each DECADMIRE module

 Report Design

 Reports are defined using the report designer. This includes the re-
 port painter (the same as the screen painter used to define modules).
 Reports can be complicated in nature with multiple selection crite-
 ria, but are not intended for ad hoc queries.

 The report design and description includes the following features:

 -  Sort parameters

 -  Module calling

 -  Module parameters

                                  4

 

 -  Report layout

 -  Report selection parameters

 Prototyping

 After the user defines the database and creates the modules that de-
 fine menus, screens, and reports, the application can be simulated us-
 ing prototyping.

 Prototyping can be completed for a single module (menu, report, or screen),
 a grouping of modules, or the entire application. Prototyping of a mod-
 ule that makes a call to other modules automatically includes all re-
 lated modules in the prototyping session. Data can be entered, retrieved,
 and updated, using the DECADMIRE BUILDER data structure, simulating
 the final application based on a test or existing Rdb database.

 Prototyping closely mimics the completed application. However, some
 inconsistencies within the prototyping environment are not in the fi-
 nal generated application. Customizations made to the generated code
 are not operational in the prototyping. Application Generation

 DECADMIRE generates the required information to build an application,
 including the following:

 o  Table descriptions (COPY-files for 3GL)

 o  Entire application's CDD/Repository and supporting CDO language

 o  A specific database table for CDD/Repository and supporting CDO lan-
    guage

 o  A test Rdb database (multiple or single file) and required SQL lan-
    guage definition

 o  Table descriptions (COPY-files) for DECforms (if CDD/Repository is
    not used for compiling)

 o  Lists of values for DECforms

                                  5

 

 o  TFM client repository for TFM client/server applications (ACMS gen-
    eration only)

 o  ACMS Desktop workspace definition client file

 o  RTR embedded calls (COBOL only)

 o  ACMS task, task group, ACMS application definition file, and sin-
    gle step task for NO I/O task ACMS implementations (ACMS versions
    of DECADMIRE only)

 o  Handbook user documentation for a specific module or the entire ap-
    plication

 o  Support of RMS files via the DEC DB Integrator Gateway for RMS for
    OpenVMS

 There are two methods for creating applications from the modules cre-
 ated with the DECADMIRE BUILDER:

 o  Generation and compilation of source code module-by-module. This
    method allows the user to create pieces of an application program
    as they are completed.

 o  Generation, compilation, and linking of the source code into ex-
    ecutable code for the entire application all at the same time, start-
    ing from a defined top-level module. Usually this method is used
    when all the source code for a specific routine/module or the en-
    tire application has been completed. The DECADMIRE GENERATOR au-
    tomatically processes all modules in the correct sequence.

 Timesharing applications can scale to TP by specifying ACMS during re-
 generation (ACMS license required). The specific language and DECforms
 are exactly the same in both applications preserving all modifications
 made. The language driver code is replaced with an ACMS task and other
 ACMS components. An object library with some generic routines is used
 during the linking of the application. Development Environment Reports



                                  6

 

 DECADMIRE provides reports that describe information contained in the
 DECADMIRE dictionary. These reports can be used during development and
 as application documentation. The following types of reports are avail-
 able:

 o  Table and associated columns

 o  Application modules (menu, screen, and report)

 o  Module calls and modules called from

 o  Fields and their associated screens and reports (valid for DECforms
    only)

 o  References to a column

 o  Related modules

 Support Functions

 DECADMIRE includes an authorization tool and a print, batch, and queue
 management facility, which are available for use in the generated ap-
 plication. (Available only on server code with DECforms.)

 DECADMIRE BUILDING BLOCKS

 DECADMIRE includes a set of 15 building blocks, which represent a col-
 lection of application-specific functions or actions in code templates.
 There are seven building blocks for the screen generation, one for up-
 date modules, one for the menus within the application, and six for
 the report designer.

 These building blocks can be customized for each application's needs;
 however, modifications must follow the rules for each building block.
 Customizations made within the DECADMIRE building blocks are included
 in the generated code. Removal of the code markers in the building blocks
 is not supported.



                                  7

 

 Internationalization Features

 DECADMIRE allows for localization of messages and localized language
 input, as supported by DECforms, using the screen text description.
 Sample Applications

 Six sample applications are included with the product. Modules in these
 applications can be used for self-paced training by reproducing them,
 or can be copied to quickly include similar functions in the appli-
 cation under development.

 o  Visual Basic Client Vehicle Type Application for ACMS Desktop Ap-
    plications

    -  ACMS server can be generated from DECADMIRE BUILDER

 o  DECADMIRE/TFM Order Entry Application

    -  TFM forms on the PC utilize tasks that can be built on the server.
       Both DECforms and the TFM PC forms can utilize the same ACMS ap-
       plication.

    -  TFM samples replicate the functions of the Order Entry appli-
       cation using presentation services on the PC.

 DECADMIRE/TFM for ACMS

 TFM for ACMS is a Windows[TM] based development system that can be used
 to rapidly generate Windows based PC client applications for DECAD-
 MIRE generated OpenVMS ACMS server applications.

 DECADMIRE/TFM Integrator allows the rapid development of a complete
 client/server ACMS application. The same DECADMIRE generated ACMS ap-
 plication can then be used by TFM based PC clients and terminal based
 clients.

 The TFM PC client application is developed by creating a correspond-
 ing set of PC based building blocks. At run time the client and server
 building blocks interact to provide the required application features.

 Each DECADMIRE building block is represented on the PC by the creation
 of three TFM objects:

 o  A building block specific TFM dialog model, which provides the struc-
    ture of the building block.

 o  A building block specific TFM dialog box, which the developer de-
    signs to create the user interface presented by the building block.

 o  A building block specific TFM subroutine library, which contains
    the code that is used during the execution of the building block.

                                  9

 

 The product provides a set of template building block objects (dia-
 log model, dialog box, subroutine library). The TFM PC client devel-
 oper produces a working PC client application by customizing these tem-
 plate TFM dialog models and subroutine libraries, which contain knowl-
 edge of all the DECADMIRE specific building blocks.

 Customizations are performed using the standard TFM development tools,
 and the application is tested and debugged with the powerful TFM Test
 and Debugging facilities. The application can be built and tested in-
 crementally and interactively. During the actual execution of the ap-
 plication, the data sent between the client and the server can be in-
 spected and altered, new building blocks can be modified or created.
 It is possible to quickly build a basic working client application,
 then refine and enhance it as required.

 The final deliverable application consists of a number of small build-
 ing block objects, which are executed by the standard TFM run-time pack-
 age. Individual objects can be updated and distributed without any re-
 building of the complete application.

 The product promotes a PC Client technical architecture, which allows
 the developer to concentrate almost exclusively on the user interface
 (dialog boxes and the visual appearance) and the application features,
 without being concerned with the details of DECADMIRE interfacing, ACMS
 or Windows programming.

 DECADMIRE contains a subset of the complete TFM development environ-
 ment required for client development: TFM UNIX server (starter, de-
 velopment, or repository is not included). Extended features such as
 pie-charts, bit map, and animation extensions to the client require
 the purchase of the full TFM developers kit from Digital.

 Summary of Digital Layered Products Used by DECADMIRE Generated
 Applications

 DECforms (SPD 29.90.xx)

 DECforms is Digital's strategic product for forms-based user inter-
 faces. DECforms provides an architecture that can support the evolv-
 ing needs of application developers and end users.

 DECforms is an integral component of Digital's Network Application Sup-
 port (NAS) environment, providing consistent forms-based user inter-
 face presentation services across multiple NAS platforms. DECforms is
 also the strategic front-end forms system for Digital's TP environ-
 ment, offering an integrated, efficient, asynchronous interface for
 ACMS based applications in either centralized or distributed trans-
 action processing environments on OpenVMS VAX systems.

 One of the most powerful principles reflected in the DECforms archi-
 tecture is complete separation of form and function. With DECforms,
 user interface processing is completely removed from the application
 program and totally isolated within the form itself. The application
 program is concerned only with the processing of data, not with the
 gathering and display of data at the user interface. This makes ap-
 plication programs much simpler to develop and easier to maintain.

 ACMS (SPD 25.50.xx)

 ACMS is a transaction processing (TP) monitor designed for OpenVMS op-
 erating systems. ACMS works with other Digital Equipment Corporation
 commercial application software products to provide users with a com-
 plete and customizable development and run-time environment for trans-
 action processing applications such as order tracking, accounting and
 billing, shop floor control, and insurance claims processing.

 ACMS software helps users through the entire application development
 life cycle, including the installation, planning, design, development,




                                 11

 

 testing, implementation, management, and maintenance of complex TP ap-
 plications. ACMS provides a special-purpose application definition lan-
 guage for structured definition of TP application functions and run-
 time characteristics.

 ACMS Desktop for OpenVMS (SPD 34.81.xx)

 ACMS Desktop is a layered software product that allows application pro-
 grams running in MS-DOS®, Macintosh®, SCO[TM], UNIX®, OSF/1, and Open-
 VMS operating system environments to access OpenVMS based ACMS trans-
 action processing applications through a desktop programming inter-
 face.


 RTR for OpenVMS (SPD 34.30.xx)

 Reliable Transaction Router for OpenVMS may be licensed for either full
 function operation or to work only as a client. It is a reliable, trans-
 parent message routing system that includes both a transactional and
 a nontransactional message control system.

 Reliable Transaction Router for OpenVMS implements automatic software
 fault tolerance and failure recovery on the OpenVMS operating system
 by adapting to hardware (CPU), communications, and application soft-
 ware failures.

 Reliable Transaction Router for OpenVMS provides users with the abil-
 ity to easily partition multiple application programs over DECnet lo-
 cal area networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs). Ease of de-
 velopment features include both a Requester (Client)/Server design en-
 vironment, with optional all-or-nothing transaction semantics, as well
 as a message broadcasting capability. Reliable Transaction Router for
 OpenVMS implements virtual, rather than physical, networks, which pro-
 vide the application developer with a "single view" of a distributed
 client/server environment. This technique allows the application soft-
 ware to be independent of physical hardware (CPU) location, network
 naming conventions, and communications protocol.



                                 12

 


 COBOL (SPD 25.04.xx)

 COBOL is a high-level language for business data processing that op-
 erates under OpenVMS operating systems, taking full advantage of the
 system facilities and the Information Architecture. COBOL is based upon
 the 1985 ANSI COBOL Standard X3.23-1985 as modified by the X.23a-1989
 amendment. Pascal (SPD 25.11.xx)

 Pascal is an implementation of the Pascal language that accepts pro-
 grams compatible with either level of the ISO specification for pro-
 gramming languages - Pascal [ISO 7185-1983(E)] as well as ANSI/IEEE
 770X3.97-1983 (December, 1983). Pascal also meets the Federal Infor-
 mation Processing Standard Publication (FIPS-109) requirements by ac-
 cepting programs conforming to the ANSI standard. Pascal also accepts
 many features from the Extended Pascal standard (ANSI/IEEE 770X3.160-
 1989 and ISO 10206)

 DEC Fortran for OpenVMS (SPD 25.16.xx)

 DEC Fortran is an implementation of full language FORTRAN-77, conform-
 ing to American National Standard FORTRAN, ANSI X3.9-1978. It includes
 optional support for programs conforming to the previous standard, ANSI
 X3.9-1966. DEC Fortran meets the Federal Information Processing Stan-
 dard Publication (FIPS-69-1) requirements by conforming to the ANSI
 Standard and by including a flagger. The flagger optionally produces
 diagnostic messages for compile-time elements that do not conform to
 the Full-Level ANSI FORTRAN X3.9-1978 Standard. DEC Fortran also con-
 forms to the International Standard ISO 1539-1980(E) and to MIL-STD
 1753.


 DEC C (SPD VAX: 25.38.xx, AXP: 42.26.xx)







                                 13

 

 DEC C is an ANSI-compliant implementation of the C programming lan-
 guage with Digital extensions. The DEC C compiler runs under the Open-
 VMS Operating Systems and generates optimized and position-independent
 code. DEC C is a native-mode language product, and is integrated into
 the OpenVMS Common Language Environment. All OpenVMS system services
 are available to programs written in DEC C. DEC C programs can invoke
 functions written in other languages.

 DEC Rdb for OpenVMS (SPD 25.59.xx)

 DEC Rdb for OpenVMS is a full-function, SQL-based relational database
 management system designed for the OpenVMS operating system. It is in-
 tended for general purpose, multiuser, centralized, or distributed ap-
 plications and includes database administration utilities and support
 for host-based and client/server programming. DEC Rdb is available on
 both OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS AXP systems. CDD/Repository (SPD 25.53.xx)

 CDD/Repository for OpenVMS is an active, distributed repository sys-
 tem that provides the capabilities for users to organize, manage, con-
 trol, and integrate tools and applications across the entire enter-
 prise. CDD/Repository is the foundation of Digital Equipment Corpo-
 ration's COHESION Environment and a component of Network Application
 Support (NAS). It is an evolutionary outgrowth of the earlier CDD/Plus
 data dictionary and is now able to provide the data integration ca-
 pabilities required in software development environments. ACMS uti-
 lizes CDD/Repository for the creation, analysis, and administration
 of metadata.


 TFM (SPD 44.19.xx)

 TFM provides a robust and complete development environment for cre-
 ating clients for ACMS in a client/server architecture.
