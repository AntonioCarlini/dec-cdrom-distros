 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC Network Integration Server Software, Version 1.2 SPD
 36.05.03

 DESCRIPTION

 The DEC Network Integration Server (DECNIS) software runs on any DEC
 Network Integration Server 500 or 600 series hardware unit. It pro-
 vides routing, bridging, and X.25 gateway services to network systems
 located on a Local Area Network (LAN) or connected directly to the hard-
 ware unit over synchronous line connections.

 Overview

 The DECNIS software provides a multiprotocol routing service for:

 o  TCP/IP hosts

 o  OSI-compatible systems

 o  DECnet/OSI Phase V nodes

 o  DECnet Phase IV nodes

 These end systems may be located on the same LAN or directly connected
 to the synchronous communications ports of the DECNIS hardware unit.
 Multi-protocol routing is implemented using the ISO Intermediate Sys-
 tem to Intermediate System (IS-IS) Routing Exchange Protocol extended
 to handle both TCP/IP and DECnet network traffic. Routing of TCP/IP
 traffic is also supported using RIP in DECnet areas without the need
 for IS-IS routing in the area.

 The DECNIS software provides a bridging service for any end-system lo-
 cated on any LAN connected to the DECNIS hardware unit which gener-
 ates LAN traffic which is not routable by the DECNIS routing service.
 This traffic can be bridged to another LAN connected locally to the
 DECNIS hardware unit or to a LAN connected remotely to another DEC-
 NIS hardware unit across a wide area link.

                               DIGITAL                   August 1992

                                                         AE-PQBSD-TE

 

 The DECNIS can also provide an X.25 gateway service to relay X.25 level
 3 packets to and from Digital and non-Digital systems on a LAN, X.25
 Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) connected directly to the unit or con-
 nected over an X.25 Packet Switched Data Network (PSDN).

 The DECNIS software image is installed and configured on an OpenVMS[*],
 VAX/ULTRIX or RISC/ULTRIX system (termed a load host). The load host
 may be:

 o  Located on the same LAN or extended LAN as the DECNIS hardware unit

 o  Accessible from another DECNIS connected directly to the target hard-
    ware unit over one or more synchronous links

 Once configured, the software image is downline loaded to the hard-
 ware unit from the load host.

 The DECNIS software can be managed from any OpenVMS or ULTRIX end sys-
 tem using either the DECnet Network Command Language (NCL) or the DEC
 Management Control Center (DECmcc). Monitoring of the Internet func-
 tions of the software can be performed from any system supporting the
 Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). A separate data tracing util-
 ity available on OpenVMS systems assists problem solving by tracing
 control messages received or sent by the DECNIS software.

 DECnet Routing

 The DECNIS software implements both the DECnet Phase IV routing al-
 gorithm (routing vector) and the DECnet/OSI Phase V routing algorithm
 (link-state routing). The DECNIS software supports both intra-area rout-
 ing (Level 1) and inter-area routing (Level 2). The DECNIS software
 can run either the Phase IV or Phase V routing algorithm in either com-
 bination at each level. When running the Phase V algorithms at either
 level 1 or level 2, the routing software is still able to handle traf-
 fic generated by DECnet Phase IV end systems and performs any neces-
 sary address and header conversions.

 Communication with other DECnet end or intermediate systems over the
 synchronous connections can use either HDLC or X.25 data link circuits.

 The DECNIS software supports path splitting over up to four routing
 circuits. If the cost between the router and the destination node is
 the same on multiple synchronous circuits, then the DECNIS software
 splits the traffic across the circuits.

 Internet Routing

 The DECNIS software provides support for the following IP routing pro-
 tocols:

 o  RIP (RFC 1058)

 o  Integrated IS-IS (RFC 1195)

 o  EGP (RFCs 827, 888, and 904)

 Integrated IS-IS is OSI IS-IS Intra-Domain routing, with additions to
 support IP routing as defined in RFC 1195. An IS-IS routing circuit
 is required in order to handle IP traffic either within a level 1 area
 or between areas over a level 2 link. It is also possible to route IP
 traffic using RIP within a DECnet Phase IV only network by running RIP
 over the DECnet Phase IV level 1 or level 2 links.

 In addition to IP routing protocols, the software also supports IP reach-
 able addresses (static routes) over any circuit.

 When using Integrated IS-IS, the software supports equal-cost path split-
 ting of IP data over up to four equal-cost paths. Variable, but con-
 tiguous, IP subnet masks are also supported.

 The DECNIS software can communicate directly with IP hosts or gate-
 ways over CSMA/CD or dynamically assigned X.25 circuits. It interop-
 erates with other IP gateways using RIP or EGP on these circuits. For-
 warding of IP traffic over X.25 circuits is in accordance with RFC 877.



                                  3

 

 When operating over HDLC and X.25 static circuits, the software com-
 municates directly only with other Digital routers. When operating over
 X.25 dynamic circuits, the software can communicate with other routers
 which support the OSI connectionless network service over X.25 data
 links.

 The DECNIS software communicates with IP hosts and gateways using the
 ARP protocol on CSMA/CD circuits (RFC 826). Proxy ARP (RFC 1027) is
 also supported.

 OSI Routing

 The DECNIS software fully implements the requirements of an OSI In-
 termediate System. The DECNIS software exchanges information about reach-
 ability of end systems using the OSI Intermediate System to Interme-
 diate System (IS-IS) Intra-Domain Routing Exchange Protocol as spec-
 ified in ISO/IEC 10589. OSI-compatible end systems on the same Local
 Area Network can exchange information with the DECNIS software and use
 the OSI End System to Intermediate System (ES-IS) Routing Exchange Pro-
 tocol as specified in ISO 9542.

 The DECNIS software uses the OSI Connectionless Network Protocol (CLNP),
 as specified in ISO 8473, to communicate with OSI-compatible systems
 over an ISO 8802/3 or IEEE 802.3 Local Area Network. Communication over
 the synchronous links uses either the HDLC or the X.25 packet-level
 protocols.

 Bridging

 The DECNIS software supports both local and remote bridging of any data
 traffic which cannot be routed, e.g., Digital's LAT, PC LAN protocols
 such as Novell(R) NetWare(R), Xerox(R) XNS, and Apple(R) AppleTalk(R).

 DECnet, IP, and OSI protocols are always routed and cannot be bridged
 except in the following cases:

 o  IP traffic can either be routed or bridged on a systemwide basis.
    When IP routing is not enabled, IP traffic will be bridged on all
    interfaces. Bridge filtering can be enabled for IP traffic on a port-
    by-port basis.

                                  4

 

 o  OSI null-Internet frames will always be bridged.

 The DECNIS software implements the IEEE 802.1D Spanning Tree Proto-
 col and will interoperate with other Digital or IEEE 802.1D-compliant
 bridges in the same extended LAN.

 When used as a local bridge, the DECNIS software forwards data pack-
 ets from one LAN interface to another LAN interface. When used as a
 remote bridge, the DECNIS software forwards data packets from one LAN
 interface, through the DEC WANcontroller 622 interface card, to a sim-
 ilar card on another DECNIS hardware unit.

 Remote bridging is supported over multiple remote hops but there are
 restrictions on the number of synchronous links and the minimum speed
 of these links. Please refer to the Bridging Configuration Guidelines
 section in this SPD for further details.

 Remote bridging is only supported on the high-speed DEC WANcontroller
 622 network interface card; it is not supported on the DEC WANcontroller
 618 network interface card.

 Bridge traffic, both local and remote, may be filtered based on a com-
 bination of source or destination address and protocol type on a port-
 by-port basis.

 X.25 Routing Circuits

 The DECNIS software supports the use of statically and dynamically as-
 signed X.25 routing circuits. Static circuits are established when the
 routing circuit is enabled and remain set up until the routing cir-
 cuit is disabled. Dynamically assigned circuits are established only
 when there is information to send over the routing circuit. They are
 disconnected when there is no further information to send.

 The DECNIS software supports more than one connection to one or more
 X.25 PSDNs. The software can share outgoing calls between all the DTEs
 connected to a PSDN. The DECNIS software supports routing over either
 Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVCs) or Switched Virtual Circuits (SVCs).


                                  5

 

 Each X.25 virtual circuit can run only one routing protocol. However,
 different routing protocols can be run over separate virtual circuits
 on the same X.25 DTE connection.

 X.25 Gateway

 When operating as an X.25 Gateway, the DECNIS software transmits and
 receives X.25 packets to and from any of the following systems:

 o  Any Digital systems which support the DNA Gateway Access Protocol
    (GAP).

 o  Any systems located on the same LAN which support the ISO Logical
    Link Control 2 (LLC2) protocol (as described in ISO 8881).

 o  Any X.25 DTE accessible over an X.25 Public Switched Data Network
    (PSDN) connected to the DECNIS.

 o  Any X.25 DTE connected directly to a synchronous port of the DEC-
    NIS operating in X.25 DCE mode (ISO 8208 point-to-point mode).

 o  Any X.25 DTE connected to any other DECNIS or DEC X.25gateway 100
    /500 server accessible to the DECNIS over the DECnet/OSI routing
    network.

 When providing wide area access to an X.25 PSDN for end systems on the
 LAN which use LLC2, the DECNIS software fully implements the recom-
 mendations in ISO Technical Report 10029 as a CONS LAN/WAN relay.

 X.25 packets can be relayed locally between any X.25 DTE attached to
 the DECNIS hardware unit and any other similarly attached X.25 DTE or
 any X.25 system connected to the same LAN. Additionally, X.25 pack-
 ets can be relayed to remote X.25 DTEs accessible to other DECNIS or
 DEC X25gateway 100/500 servers over a DECnet/OSI routing network. The
 software does not support the relaying of X.25 packets generated from
 an X.25 DTE connected to an X.25 PSDN to an X.25 DTE connected to an-
 other X.25 PSDN.



                                  6

 

 The DECNIS software supports both Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVCs)
 and Switched Virtual Circuits (SVCs) and allows multiple connections
 to one or more PSDNs. Most major international public X.25 PSDNs are
 supported. For a current list of public X.25 PSDNs and X.25(1984) op-
 tional facilities supported by the DECNIS, refer to the System Sup-
 port Addendum (SSA 36.05.03-x).

 The following accounting information is provided by the DECNIS X.25
 Gateway software:

 o  Logging of virtual circuit accounting when calls are cleared

 o  Logging of accounting records to a designated Event Logging sink

 o  Logging to multiple sinks for reliability

 The following security mechanisms are supported in the DECNIS X.25 Gate-
 way software:

 o  Inbound and outbound calls can be controlled on the basis of the
    remote DTE, the application, and, if applicable, the X.25 Access
    node

 o  Access to accounting sink management is restricted to authorized
    users

 o  Access to accounting source management is restricted to authorized
    users

 Installation and Configuration

 The minimum requirement is for one host to load the DECNIS hardware
 unit. However, the DECNIS software can be installed on a number of load
 hosts. This helps to protect against loss of service if a single load
 host is unavailable or unable to load the system for any other rea-
 son.

 Installation is performed using VMSINSTAL (on OpenVMS) or setld (on
 ULTRIX). The software must be configured using two configuration pro-
 grams supplied with the product. These configuration programs allow
 the network manager to set up the downline load database and to de-
 fine the required DECNIS management entities.

                                  7

 

 The DECNIS hardware unit must be located on the same LAN as the load
 host or connected by a synchronous circuit to another operating DEC-
 NIS system. When loading over synchronous links, the DECNIS system per-
 forming the loading operation is configured to copy the required files
 from any load host by establishing a DECnet connection to that load
 host. Loading of DECNIS units may also be daisy-chained over a sequence
 of synchronous links. The only restriction is that the first DECNIS
 in the chain must be on the same LAN as the load host and each mem-
 ber of the chain must be another DECNIS unit. The DECNIS unit can also
 be used to load any other Digital device which supports Digital's Main-
 tenance Operation Protocol (MOP) over synchronous links.

 Management

 The DECNIS software conforms to both the Digital Enterprise Manage-
 ment Architecture (EMA) and the Internet Structure of Management In-
 formation. Access to the manageable entities is supported using ei-
 ther the OSI Control Management Information Protocol (CMIP) or the Sim-
 ple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

 Permanent changes to the configuration of the DECNIS software can be
 made by using the configuration utilities to create a script file and
 then rebooting the hardware unit. Temporary changes to the configu-
 ration of the DECNIS software can be made by using any EMA-compliant
 Director such as NCL or DECmcc from any available system.

 Other management tasks can also be performed from Network Management
 directors allowing the network manager to:

 o  Manage specific connections, for example, set up the data links,
    enable and disable circuits.

 o  Monitor network traffic, for example, enable event logging, dis-
    play counters.

 o  Resolve problems, for example, test circuit availability, perform
    loopback tests.

 An additional utility called Common Tracing Facility (CTF) is avail-
 able on OpenVMS systems to assist with problem solving by tracing con-
 trol messages as they are processed by the DECNIS software.

                                  8

 

 Information about Internet variables held on the DECNIS software can
 also be accessed by Network Management systems using the Simple Net-
 work Management Protocol (SNMP). The DECNIS software implements the
 Management Information Base-II (MIB-II) variables which can be read
 by any SNMP management station. Note that support is not provided for
 modifying these variables from an SNMP management station. SNMP can
 only be used to access these variables when routing is enabled for IP
 traffic.

 Physical Line Support

 The DECNIS hardware units are modular, expandable, hardware platforms.
 The DECNIS 500 is a four-slot enclosure; the DECNIS 600 is a nine-slot
 enclosure. The first two slots are reserved for Management Processor
 and Pool Memory cards; the remaining slots are available for network
 interface cards. The DECNIS software operates on all DECNIS 500 and
 DECNIS 600 configurations.

 The following network interface cards are supported by the DECNIS 500
 /600 series hardware units. The DECNIS 500 can contain up to two net-
 work interface cards; the DECNIS 600 can contain up to seven network
 interface cards.

 o  DEC LANcontroller 601 - Single-port Ethernet/IEEE 802.3 interface

 o  DEC LANcontroller 602 - Dual-port Ethernet/IEEE 802.3 interface

 o  DEC WANcontroller 618 - Eight-port, low-speed synchronous inter-
    face supports line speeds from 1.2 Kbits/s to 128 Kbits/s

 o  DEC WANcontroller 622 - Dual-port, high-speed synchronous inter-
    face supports line speeds from 9.6 Kbits/s to 2 Mbits/s

 Communication over the synchronous lines is full-duplex with full mo-
 dem control on all synchronous line(s). The synchronous port(s) can
 operate as HDLC point-to-point links or X.25 LAPB/LAPBE links.




                                  9

 

 The DEC WANcontroller 618 and 622 synchronous interfaces support V.24
 interchange circuits with the following electrical interfaces:

 o  DEC WANcontroller 618:

    -  V.28 (EIA-RS232-D/EIA-RS232-C)

    -  V.36/V.11 (RS449/RS422)

    -  V.35

 o  DEC WANcontroller 622:

    -  V.36/V.11 (RS449/RS422)

    -  V.35

    -  CCITT X.21 (Leased line services)

    -  British Telecom Kilostream

 The number of lines supported depends on the synchronous interface and
 the number of these interfaces installed in the hardware unit.

 For the DEC WANcontroller 618, separate distribution panels are re-
 quired for support of RS232/V.28, RS422/V.11, and V.35 interfaces. For
 use with British Telecom Kilostream services, an extra adapter cable
 is used in conjunction with the RS422/V.11 distribution panel. Refer
 to the System Support Addendum (SSA 36.05.03-x) for further informa-
 tion on the required adapter cable.

 For the DEC WANcontroller 622, separate adapter cables provide the nec-
 essary interchange circuits for each synchronous line. Refer to the
 System Support Addendum (SSA 36.05.03-x) for further information on
 the required adapter cables.

 When used with T1 or G.703 lines, the additional requirements for op-
 eration of the DEC WANcontroller 622 are as follows:

 o  The DEC WANcontroller 622 supports only clear channel interfaces.
    Connection to a T1 or G.703 line requires a V.35/RS422 to T1/G.703
    DSU/CSU converter to provide framing to meet CCITT G.704. The DEC
    WANcontroller 622 does not provide either T1 framing pulses or sep-
    arate channels for 64 Kbits/s control data for G.703.

                                 10

 

 o  The DEC WANcontroller 622 does not guarantee line density. T1 links
    can offer only 1.536 Mbits/s or 1.344 Mbits/s rates. 1.536 Mbits
    /s rates require the DSU/CSU converter to offer B8ZS and the line
    to accept bipolar violations. 1.334 Mbits/s rates require the DSU
    /CSU converter to offer B7.

 o  Transmit clocking should be provided by the DCE, CCITT 114. The DEC
    WANcontroller 622 uses CCITT 114 to clock data out of the DTE and
    will source a CCITT 113 transmit clock. CCITT 113 should be used
    by the DCE to receive the transmit data. The DEC WANcontroller 622
    implements CCITT 113 as a buffered version of CCITT 114. This clock-
    ing scheme ensures both network synchronization and minimized skew
    between the clock and data for a range of cable lengths and param-
    eters.

 If the above transmit clocking mechanism is not provided by the DCE,
 this DCE must provide a method of adjusting the phase of the clock used
 to sample the data with respect to that supplied to the DTE. This re-
 quires that the DCE provide test points to allow analysis of the clock
 and data waveforms and that this adjustment be performed on instal-
 lation and after any subsequent alteration of the connection cable.
 This alternative method is also required for DCEs utilizing the X.21
 interface.

 For more information about CSU/DSU converters supported by the DEC WAN-
 controller 622, please refer to the System Support Addendum (SSA 36.05.03-
 x).

 Network Size and Supported Circuits

 DECnet Phase IV networks are hierarchical networks that can be seg-
 mented into up to 63 areas, each containing up to 1,023 nodes. Note
 these are maximum values permitted by the Digital Network Architec-
 ture and satisfactory operation in large networks requires proper net-
 work planning.





                                 11

 

 DECnet/OSI Phase V domains can be virtually unlimited. However, the
 actual size of a domain is limited by the product's memory size and
 processor power. Table 1 lists the values of the parameters used to
 determine the size of the supported network for DECNIS 500 and 600 se-
 ries hardware units.

 Note these figures are given as a rough guide only. Actual sizes ex-
 perienced will depend on a number of factors including the topolog-
 ical characteristics of the network, the mix of protocols and data link
 interfaces, and the amount of routing control traffic generated by the
 network. Please consult your local Digital office for more details and
 for assistance with network sizing and planning.

 Bridging Configuration Guidelines

                                 14

 

 When bridging over remote links using the DEC WANcontroller 622 net-
 work interface cards, the performance of delay-sensitive protocols (such
 as LAT) cannot be guaranteed without paying careful consideration to
 the number of bridging hops and the speed of the lines connecting the
 DECNIS units. Digital warrants and supports the DECNIS software prod-
 uct when used in extended LAN configurations subject to the follow-
 ing configuration restrictions:

 o  Remote bridging is only supported on the DEC WANcontroller 622 net-
    work interface card; it is not supported on the DEC WANcontroller
    618 network interface card.

 o  Remote bridging is not supported over X.25 data links.

 o  The minimum synchronous line speed supported for remote bridging
    between DECNIS units is 56 Kb/s.

 o  Remote bridging over satellite links is not supported.

 o  A maximum of seven local and remote bridges may be configured in
    series between any two communicating end stations. Each DECNIS unit,
    or any other IEEE 802.1D or LANbridge 100 compatible bridge, counts
    as one bridge towards this maximum configuration of seven bridges.

 o  Local Area VAXclusters are not supported over remote bridging links.

 o  Digital's PC Systems Architecture (PCSA) PATHWORKS services may be
    restricted over remote bridging links; please refer to the rele-
    vant Software Product Descriptions for further information.

 In addition to the above configuration restrictions, Digital also rec-
 ommends that, when using 56 Kb/s or 64 Kb/s links between DECNIS units
 for remote LAT access, the following configuration guidelines also be
 followed to ensure reliable operation:

 o  A maximum of two synchronous links is recommended in the spanning
    tree path between the LAT server and LAT host.

 o  A minimum of 3 Kb/s should be allocated for each active LAT ses-
    sion which needs to be supported simultaneously across the remote
    link.

                                 15

 

 o  Digital recommends that the link be reserved for LAT usage and not
    shared with routed traffic such as DECnet, OSI, or IP. Also, other
    bridged traffic which may generate large packets over the remote
    link should be filtered using the DECNIS Bridge Filtering facil-
    ities.

 Public Networks Supported

 Refer to the System Support Addendum (SSA 36.05.03-x) for a list of
 the public networks that are supported by the DECNIS software. Con-
 nections to public networks not listed in the SSA are not supported
 by Digital at the time of publication of this SPD. Please consult your
 local Digital office for any questions you have concerning other pub-
 lic networks.

 In addition to the public X.25 PSDNs listed in the SSA, certain pri-
 vate PSDNs are supported by the DECNIS software. The appropriate pro-
 files are included in these products.

 Conformance to Standards

 The DECNIS software conforms to the following IEEE standards, CCITT
 recommendations, and Internet RFCs:

 Performance

 When operating over serial line connections the overall packet rate
 will be less than that indicated by the aggregate line speeds and is
 determined by such factors as:

 o  Type of traffic (routing updates or data packets) and data rates

 o  Mix of protocol types

 o  Proportion of leased line to X.25 traffic

 o  The path of messages passing through the product (synchronous-to-
    synchronous, synchronous-to-LAN, or LAN-to-LAN)

 o  Communications line characteristics

 o  Frequency and type of errors on the synchronous links

 o  Network topology

 o  Protocol overhead

 Please contact your local Digital office for further details of the
 performance characteristics of the product.

 PREREQUISITE SUPPORT
