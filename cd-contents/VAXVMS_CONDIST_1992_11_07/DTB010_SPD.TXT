 PRODUCT NAME:  PATHWORKS Desktop Backup Server         SPD 41.52.00
                for VAX/VMS, Version 1.0

 DESCRIPTION

 PATHWORKS Desktop Backup provides easy-to-use, over-the-network backup
 and restore services to IBM[R]-compatible personal computers from VAX/VMS
 servers. PATHWORKS Desktop Backup uses a client/server model to pro-
 vide unattended backup of multiple PCs to one or more servers. It uses
 DECnet services provided by Digital Equipment Corporation's PATHWORKS
 product family.

 PATHWORKS Desktop Backup Server for VAX/VMS is the server component of
 the PATHWORKS Desktop Backup product family. It is used in conjunc-
 tion with PATHWORKS Desktop Backup Client for DOS. PATHWORKS Desktop
 Backup Client for DOS (SPD 41.55.xx) provides a remote system inter-
 face for backup process management and backup/restore services.

 PATHWORKS Desktop Backup Server for VAX/VMS allows any VAX system run-
 ning DECnet to act as a backup server to attached clients running PATH-
 WORKS for DOS. PATHWORKS Desktop Backup Server for VAX/VMS initiates
 client backups, writes and reads data to/from VAX-connected tape drives,
 maintains backup schedules, and provides media management facilities.

 Clients are IBM or IBM-compatible PCs that have local disks with backup
 requirements. Clients must use MS[R]-DOS[R] as an operating system and may
 optionally use MS-Windows[R], at a minimum of Version 3.0. The server
 is a VAX/VMS platform with any tape drive supported by VMS. For the spe-
 cific list of supported tape drives, refer to the VMS Operating Sys-
 tem Software Product Description (SPD 25.01.xx). Multiple clients on
 the network can be backed up by a single Desktop Backup Server sys-
 tem.
