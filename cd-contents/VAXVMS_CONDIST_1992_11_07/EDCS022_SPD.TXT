 PRODUCT NAME:  EDCS II, Version 2.2                    SPD 26.39.05

 DESCRIPTION

 The Electronic Data Control System II (EDCS II) is an integration tool
 that provides tracking, access control, change notification, and archiv-
 ing of data across a network regardless of the application that was
 used to generate the data. EDCS II manages important information about
 the documents it is controlling. EDCS II manages non-electronic data
 such as design drawings stored on microfilm or hardcopy. In addition,
 it manages the same files electronically. It provides revision track-
 ing of work in progress, work in review, and released documents. EDCS
 II provides an automatic notification capability that maintains lists
 of persons affected by changes and informs them of the current sta-
 tus.

 EDCS II is a management tool that enables users to efficiently share
 data. It frees users from concerns over the existence of multiple orig-
 inals, latest revisions, and change notification issues. EDCS II uses
 a Client/Server Architecture where the client provides the user in-
 terface and connects to the server, which performs all data manage-
 ment tasks.

 EDCS II supports several interfaces for integration. For the end-user,
 EDCS II comes with both a terminal and DECwindows interface provid-
 ing a common menu system for both character-cell terminals and work-
 stations. For system integrators, EDCS II has a complete, callable in-
 terface providing a mechanism to integrate EDCS II into any applica-
 tion suite. Command line interface is also supported.

 All four interfaces are supported for the VMS client. Command line and
 callable interfaces are supported for the products Sun[R] UNIX[R], RISC
 /ULTRIX and PC clients with the exception that custom applications,
 e.g., MS[R]-Windows[TM] based, will be built.

 File Management

                                  2

 

 EDCS II manages the creation, use, modification, and storage of files.
 The user can also track the hierarchical relationships these files have
 to one another. The simplest entity EDCS II tracks is called an el-
 ement. A collection of elements is a group. Users can define data re-
 lationships to represent part assemblies and sub-assemblies of a prod-
 uct or other collections of data. EDCS II also allows users to cre-
 ate dependencies for the purpose of notification, which are file re-
 lationships that are not hierarchical.

 When using EDCS II to track files, the user will know who created the
 files, when they were created, what changes have been made, and where
 the file is stored. The user can also track information about their
 files by defining attributes. For example, an attribute might indi-
 cate the language in the file or the material in the file.

 EDCS II can also manage paper documents or aperture cards by storing
 pointers to offline data. In this way, the user can monitor the project
 development electronically and manage hardcopy data.

 Version Control

 Every time an entity is changed in EDCS II, a new generation is cre-
 ated. EDCS II keeps copies of each successive generation and gives each
 new entity a generation number. Users are able to find out what the
 latest generation is and can view the latest version. EDCS II provides
 the latest version automatically, unless the user specifies otherwise.
 EDCS II records all operations on entities and keeps a detailed his-
 tory of transactions.

 Access Control

 With EDCS II, the user can maintain a double security system. Access
 control is assigned to the entity and specifies whether a user can read,
 make changes on, or delete an entity. When a change is being made, EDCS
 II prevents other users from updating the same file; however, the file
 can still be viewed.




                                  3

 

 Privileges are assigned to each account. There are six privilege lev-
 els associated with user type (these privileges are cumulative). The
 privilege level assigned to each user determines whether the user is
 allowed to view, create, change, or delete data.

 Automatic Notification of Changes

 The user can set up automatic notification through the use of mail-
 ing lists. This ensures that project members in different departments
 or locations learn about important changes as soon as they occur.

 Configurable Review Manager

 The Review Manager in EDCS II enables users to review completed work
 and approve or disapprove it. This allows project members to be cer-
 tain that all the appropriate team members have reviewed the data. A
 review leader plans the review and creates the review process by as-
 signing review teams and a review path. Team members review the en-
 tity and register their opinion. The review can be configured as teams
 on serial paths, or levels, or several teams may conduct the review
 in parallel.

 History

 EDCS II tracks information about entities and maintains an audit trail
 on the entities it manages. The user can obtain all the information
 kept in the Rdb/VMS database and sort it in different ways, such as
 how many entities a user has created or how many entities have the same
 attribute.

 Archive and Retrieve

 ESCS II features a new "FETCH from archive" command which allows users
 to retrieve an entity's associated file without having to go through
 the formal EDCS procedure for bringing an ARCHIVED file back online,
 e.g., the EDCS RETRIEVE utility. This feature benefits EDCS customers
 who archive data to magnetic disk.

 Query and Database Access

                                  4

 

 Powerful and comprehensive SHOW commands allow the user to display for-
 matted information on entities and their characteristics, as well as
 access and mailing lists, user account information, or the reviews in
 progress. EDCS II has a callable interface for added reporting capa-
 bilities used to return user-customized information. Information can
 also be accessed directly from the database using SQL or other query
 languages and 4th generation query applications.

 Distributed Architecture

 EDCS II consists of server software and client software. A user may
 issue commands from any node in a particular network that has the EDCS
 II client software installed. The server processes all of the commands
 and communicates back to the users. The information about the files
 (meta-data) is managed in the Rdb/VMS database. The electronic files
 are stored in RMS. Non-resident files are tracked by use of pointers.

 Ability to Manage Heterogeneous Data

 EDCS II is an application-independent file manager. The system is ca-
 pable of managing electronically formatted data or hardcopy data such
 as paper documents or fiche cards.

 Four Types of Interfaces

 EDCS II provides users with four options for interfacing with EDCS II.
 There are two menu interfaces; one that runs under DECwindows on work-
 stations, and a similar interface (DECforms) for character cell ter-
 minals. For the more advanced user, EDCS II commands can be executed
 at DCL. For users interested in tailoring EDCS II to their specific
 environment, a callable interface is provided. The callable interface
 adheres to the VMS Operating System calling standards. Fully supported
 languages are: BASIC, FORTRAN, C, BLISS-32, Pascal, and PL/1.

 Heterogenous Clients

 EDCS II provides four client platforms: VMS, RISC/ULTRIX, Sun UNIX and
 386/486 PCs. Full EDCS II functionality (with the exception of EMU)
 is available through the command line and callable interfaces on these
 clients.

 RISC/ULTRIX, Sun UNIX and 386/486 PCs access the server through the
 VMS router client software. This client is an optional layer on the
 VMS client platform.

 Viewer/Editor Integration with Other Tools

 Simple callable routines allow customizers of the product to provide
 users seamless integration of EDCS II with DECview 3D, DECwrite and
 Autocad. A user can apply the full power of these tools while main-
 taining control of the associated files by EDCS II.
