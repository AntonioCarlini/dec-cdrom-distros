 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC Availability Manager for            SPD 34.88.00
                Distributed Systems, Version 1.0

 DESCRIPTION

 DEC Availability Manager for Distributed Systems
 (DECamds), Version 1.0 is a real-time monitoring, investigation, di-
 agnostic, and software correction tool that assists system managers
 to improve system availability.

 DECamds collects and analyzes system-level data from multiple nodes
 simultaneously, directing all output to a centralized display. Based
 on data it collects, DECamds detects, analyzes, and proposes actions
 to correct resource exhaustion and denial problems in real-time. These
 actions can be executed in real-time.

 The DECamds product contains two software components:

 o  A DECwindows-based console

 o  A data collecting driver

 DECamds Console:

 o  Recognizes nodes running the DECamds driver in an extended Local
    Area Network

 o  Directs driver to collect system-level data

 o  Analyzes data collected from remote nodes to determine system avail-
    ability

 o  Logs resource exhaustion problems to a static window ranked by sever-
    ity

 o  Instructs the driver to modify data collection to gather more spe-
    cific data

 o  Allows system managers to correct various system availability prob-
    lems over the Ethernet

 o  Maintains a security file to access remote nodes

 Driver:

 o  Runs on remote nodes

 o  Interprets requests at an elevated IPL (IPL 8)

 o  Uses a security file to control READ and WRITE access from a re-
    mote node

 DECamds Communication

 The DECamds console communicates with the driver over the Ethernet us-
 ing a private 802E Ethernet protocol. The driver sends multicast hello
 messages to all nodes in an extended LAN. These messages contain the
 node name, operating system type and version, group name, and Ether-
 net address. The DECamds console recognizes these hello messages and
 begins communicating with the driver that sent the message.

 Data Collection

 To collect data, the DECamds console sends packets of instructions to
 the remote system. The driver, running on the remote systems, receives
 and interprets these packets and returns the requested data to the DE-
 Camds console for analysis, display, and problem notification.

 Monitoring and Analysis

 Upon starting DECamds, two windows are displayed: an Event Log and the
 System Overview. These windows are essential for investigating and fix-
 ing system problems.

 o  Event Log Window:

    The Event Log Window displays a list of system events as they are
    detected by the DECamds console. An event is a potential system prob-
    lem and is generated by the console whenever a system resource is
    consumed beyond a customizeable threshold.

 o  System Overview Window:

    The System Overview Window displays CPU, Memory, and I/O data for
    nodes with the driver installed. The System Overview window is the
    central navigational tool for investigating the status of the sys-
    tem manually. Data presented includes clusters, cluster nodes, stan-
    dalone nodes, and node status for CPU, I/O, memory, and processes.

 Correction

 After analyzing the resource denial or exhaustion problem, a system
 manager can direct DECamds to fix problems such as:

 o  Low memory

 o  Lock contention

 o  CPU problem

 o  I/O problem

 o  Runaway process

 o  Hung nodes

 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

 Processors and/or hardware configurations as specified in the System
 Support Addendum (SSA 34.88.00-x).

 Digital recommends that the DECamds console run on a dedicated stan-
 dalone VAXstation 3100 with 16 Mbytes of memory with a color monitor.
 However, it can run on a workstation in a cluster, or on a non-workstation
 system, using DECwindows (based on X User Interface, XUI) to direct
 the display to a workstation.
