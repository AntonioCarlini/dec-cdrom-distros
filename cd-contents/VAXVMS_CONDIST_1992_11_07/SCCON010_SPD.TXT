 PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER System Census Consolidator   SPD 39.19.00
                for OpenVMS[*], Version 1.0

 DESCRIPTION

 The POLYCENTER System Census Consolidator for OpenVMS is a software
 layered product that resides on a system running the OpenVMS Operat-
 ing System. It consolidates the information collected from the POLYCENTER
 System Census Agents, formats it into an SQL database, and makes it
 available for presentation and access by other programs.

 The POLYCENTER System Census product set is described below, followed
 by a description of the POLYCENTER System Census Consolidator for Open-
 VMS.

 POLYCENTER System Census Product Set

 POLYCENTER System Census is a product set running on OpenVMS and UL-
 TRIX platforms. It is a Digital EMA-compliant product that fits in the
 "Configuration Management" function in the Digital POLYCENTER solu-
 tion suite of products. Its design intent is the automatic and peri-
 odic gathering of configuration information from the customer's com-
 plex, worldwide, multivendor, heterogeneous distributed systems, and
 the presentation of this information in graphic displays or through
 access by other application programs. The user thus gets current in-
 formation about the enterprise system and can use it for vital func-
 tions such as resource utilization, asset management, or inventory man-
 agement.

 The   terms VMS and OpenVMS refer to the OpenVMS Operating System.

 Specifically, POLYCENTER System Census provides the user with the abil-
 ity to:

 o  Discover, identify, and collect the configuration elements of en-
    terprisewide systems in a heterogeneous environment (OpenVMS and
    ULTRIX), using Agents running on individual systems. (See SPD 39.16.xx
    for information about the POLYCENTER System Census Agent for Open-
    VMS and SPD 39.17.xx for information about the POLYCENTER System
    Census Agent for ULTRIX.)

 o  Consolidate and organize the collected data in an SQL database (Rdb/VMS
    or ULTRIX/SQL), using the Consolidator running on system(s) where
    the enterprisewide configuration data is to be consolidated. In ad-
    dition, the consolidated SQL database also provides the ability to
    augment the collected data with user-defined data, and query and
    extract the consolidated data using a variety of SQL and 4GL tools.
    (See SPD 39.20.xx for information about the POLYCENTER System Cen-
    sus Consolidator for ULTRIX.)

 o  Navigate and view the consolidated configuration data from the database
    via a DECwindows Motif(R)-based graphical user interface. (See SPD
    39.22.xx for information about the POLYCENTER System Census GUI for
    OpenVMS and SPD 39.23.xx for information about the POLYCENTER Sys-
    tem Census GUI for ULTRIX.)

 POLYCENTER System Census Agents are manageable from DECmcc, with the
 DECmcc 1.2 Director and the POLYCENTER System Census Agent Management
 Interface (MI).

 POLYCENTER System Census Consolidator for OpenVMS

 The Consolidator is given a user-defined schedule and the set of sys-
 tems from which the configuration data is to be collected, and then
 collects the data from individual Agents and consolidates it on an SQL
 database (Rdb/VMS). The Consolidator can obtain configuration data from
 one or more systems running Agents. Thus, enterprisewide configura-
 tion data can be collected from heterogeneous systems (OpenVMS and UL-
 TRIX) using network transports DECnet (for OpenVMS nodes) and/or TCP
 /IP (for ULTRIX nodes) and consolidated on an SQL database (Rdb/VMS)

                                  2

 

 for analysis, report generation, or graphical visualization (using the
 GUI).

 After building the consolidated database, the user can query and gen-
 erate extensive reports using any of the SQL or 4GL tools available
 on that system, or use the basic set of reporting capability provided
 by the Consolidator. The Consolidator database cam hold multiple ver-
 sions of data from each Agent. The number of versions kept for each
 Agent is user selectable.
