 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC Commserver for VMS, Version 1.1     SPD 33.21.01

 DESCRIPTION

 DEC Commserver for VMS is a layered software product that allows VMS
 host systems to communicate with suitably configured server systems
 over the Ethernet. The DEC Commserver for VMS software package is com-
 posed of both host and server functional components.

 The host components include:

 o  An Application Interface Driver that implements the Simpact Asso-
    ciates' application programming interface (API)

 o  A host transport driver that interfaces to the system's Ethernet
    Driver

 o  Configuration and management drivers

 The server components within DEC Commserver for VMS include:

 o  Commserver transport driver

 o  Transfer application

 o  Management and device processes

 o  VAXELN Operating System

 o  Communication protocols

 The DEC Commserver's application interface driver permits users to uti-
 lize their existing Simpact applications as if the Simpact hardware
 (ICP1622) were installed in the host. Application programs are able
 to perform $QIO requests to the DEC Commserver's host transport driver-
 all transparent to the host application. Flexibility

 DEC Commserver for VMS can be configured to interface with multiple
 servers and conversely, servers can be configured to interface with
 multiple hosts. Any combination of host and server connections can be
 made up of a maximum configuration of 31 hosts and/or 31 servers on
 a single LAN (Local Area Network). Users must follow configuration and
 performance guidelines, since the total number of communications lines
 supported is a function of line speeds and line utilization.

 Supportability

 Simpact Associates' software protocols for the DEC Commserver are sup-
 ported by Digital when purchased with the DEC Commserver for VMS soft-
 ware.

 Multiplicity

 A wide variety of Simpact protocols are available with DEC Commserver
 for VMS. These protocols are included on the DEC Commserver media, and
 can only be used by ordering the appropriate software license. Refer
 to Software Licenses in the ORDERING INFORMATION section of this SPD.

 Commserver X.25

 Simpact's CCITT 1980 X.25 interface is certified for Telenet®, Tym-
 net®, and the Defense Data Network. Line speed, utilizing four simul-
 taneous lines, is 19.2K bits per second.

 Commserver HDLC LAPB

 This high-speed, point-to-point interface is well suited for real-time
 applications such as process control, utilities monitoring, and man-
 ufacturing. Line speed, utilizing four simultaneous lines, is 19.2K
 bits per second.

 Commserver ADCCP NRM

                                  2

 

 Complying with ANSI X.366-1979 and FED-STD-1003A standards, this in-
 terface provides multi-point communications allowing a primary sta-
 tion to communicate with multiple secondary stations. Line speed, uti-
 lizing four simultaneous lines, is 19.2K bits per second.

 Commserver ADCCP ABM

 Complying with ANSI X.366-1979 and FED-STD-1003A standards, this in-
 terface provides high-speed, point-to-point communications and is well-
 suited to satellite communications. Line speed, utilizing four simul-
 taneous lines, is 19.2K bits per second.

 Commserver BSC 2780/3780 and BSC 3270

 These interfaces connect non-IBM® systems to traditional IBM comput-
 ing environments, performing point-to-point file transfer or connect-
 ing systems to IBM 3270 display devices within a multi-drop network.
 Line speed, utilizing four simultaneous lines, is 19.2K bits per sec-
 ond.

 Commserver FMP

 This interface connects computers to nearly all systems that broad-
 cast stock, bond, and commodity information including SIAC, NASDAQ,
 OPRA, and NYSE. Line speed, utilizing four simultaneous lines, is 19.2K
 bits per second.

 Commserver AUTODIN

 Certified per DCA circular 370-D195-1, this interface connects sys-
 tems to message centers within the store-and-forward AUTODIN network.
 Asynchronous line speed, utilizing four simultaneous lines, is 19.2K
 bits per second; synchronous line speed, utilizing four simultaneous
 lines, is 4.8K bits per second.

 Commserver IDN, TIC 4, and TIQ

 This interface furnishes systems with direct access to Telerate's Mar-
 ketfeed, Telekurs' Marketfeed, or Reuter's Marketfeed 2000 consoli-
 dated market data streams. Line speed, utilizing four simultaneous lines,
 is 19.2K bits per second.

                                  3

 

 Commserver S.W.I.F.T. & CHIPS

 This interface connects systems to the S.W.I.F.T. & CHIPS electronic
 funds transfer networks. A safe-store feature ensures integrity of fi-
 nancial data. Line speed, utilizing four simultaneous lines, is 19.2K
 bits per second.

 Commserver DDCMP

 This interface is configurable for a variety of parameters. These pa-
 rameters include data rate, protocol type, and QIO access. Performance

 DEC Commserver for VMS performance is measured in terms of the per-
 formance of the individual components. In particular, customers must
 be aware of the performance restrictions of the communications devices
 being used. Simpact's ICP1622 and EXC1612 modules are capable of sup-
 porting line speeds up to 64K bits per second. However, the antici-
 pated performance of any individual communication line must consider
 data throughput needs, the protocol(s) used, the number of communi-
 cation lines per DEC Commserver system, and the density of traffic on
 the Ethernet.

 INSTALLATION

 Only experienced customers should attempt installation of this prod-
 uct. Digital recommends that all other customers purchase Digital's
