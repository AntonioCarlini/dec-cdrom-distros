 PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER System Census GUI            SPD 39.22.00
                for OpenVMS[*], Version 1.0

 DESCRIPTION

 The POLYCENTER System Census GUI for OpenVMS is a software layered prod-
 uct that resides on a system running the OpenVMS Operating System. It
 provides a graphical (iconic) user interface to visualize and navi-
 gate through the configuration information collected by the POLYCEN-
 TER System Census Agents and consolidated into an SQL database by the
 POLYCENTER System Census Consolidator.

 The POLYCENTER System Census product set is described below, followed
 by a description of the POLYCENTER System Census GUI for OpenVMS.

 POLYCENTER System Census Product Set

 POLYCENTER System Census is a product set running on OpenVMS and UL-
 TRIX platforms. It is a Digital EMA-compliant product that fits in the
 "Configuration Management" function in the Digital POLYCENTER solu-
 tion suite of products. Its design intent is the automatic and peri-
 odic gathering of configuration information from the customer's com-
 plex, worldwide, multivendor, heterogeneous distributed systems, and
 the presentation of this information in graphic displays or through
 access by other application programs. The user thus gets current in-
 formation about the enterprise system and can use it for vital func-
 tions such as resource utilization, asset management, or inventory man-
 agement.

 The   terms VMS and OpenVMS refer to the OpenVMS Operating System.


                               DIGITAL                September 1992

                                                         AE-PSE4A-TE

 

 Specifically, POLYCENTER System Census provides the user with the abil-
 ity to:

 o  Discover, identify, and collect the configuration elements of en-
    terprisewide systems in a heterogeneous environment (OpenVMS and
    ULTRIX), using Agents running on individual systems. (See SPD 39.16.xx
    for information about the POLYCENTER System Census Agent for Open-
    VMS and SPD 39.17.xx for information about the POLYCENTER System
    Census Agent for ULTRIX.)

 o  Consolidate and organize the collected data in an SQL database (Rdb/VMS
    or ULTRIX/SQL), using the Consolidator running on system(s) where
    the enterprisewide configuration data is to be consolidated. In ad-
    dition, the consolidated SQL database also provides the ability to
    augment the collected data with user-defined data, and query and
    extract the consolidated data using a variety of SQL and 4GL tools.
    (See SPD 39.19.xx for information about the POLYCENTER System Cen-
    sus Consolidator for OpenVMS and SPD 39.20.xx for information about
    the POLYCENTER System Census Consolidator for ULTRIX.)

 o  Navigate and view the consolidated configuration data from the database
    via a DECwindows Motif(R)-based graphical user interface. (See SPD
    39.23.xx for information about the POLYCENTER System Census GUI for
    ULTRIX.)

 POLYCENTER System Census Agents are manageable from DECmcc, with the
 DECmcc 1.2 Director and the POLYCENTER System Census Agent Management
 Interface (MI).

 POLYCENTER System Census GUI for OpenVMS

 The GUI is an intuitive graphical user interface based on DECwindows
 Motif that displays the stored information from the Consolidator-generated
 SQL database. The user can navigate within the enterprisewide config-
 uration data from the SQL database, and obtain various categories of
 configuration information (Hardware, Software, User, Licenses, Filesys-
 tems, Queues, etc.).

 A context-sensitive online Motif Help system is provided to help the
 user during navigation. The GUI allows the user to extract the con-
 figuration data into a variety of forms-hardcopy PostScript(R), text,
 and compound document (DDIF) formats. It also allows users to augment
 the configuration data with user-supplied data, thus enabling the users
 to attach "Configuration Notes" to the automatically collected data.
