 PRODUCT NAME:  DEC WANrouter 150/250, Version 1.0      SPD 36.24.00

 DESCRIPTION

 The DEC WANrouter 150/250 software provides a Wide Area Network (WAN)
 routing service for nodes on a Local Area Network (LAN). It runs on
 either the DEC WANserver 150 (DSRVJ) or DECrouter 250 (DSRVR) hard-
 ware units. The combination of these software/hardware packages are
 known as the DEC WANrouter 150 when running on a DSRVJ, and DEC WAN-
 router 250 when running on a DSRVR.

 Overview

 The DEC WANrouter 150/250 software provides a network routing service
 for:

 o  TCP/IP hosts

 o  OSI-compatible systems

 o  DECnet/OSI Phase V nodes

 o  DECnet Phase IV nodes

 These nodes and hosts can be connected to the DEC WANrouter 150 or 250
 via:

 o  The same Local Area Network as the DEC
    WANrouter 150 or 250 using Ethernet or IEEE 802.3 protocols

 o  The serial communications ports of the router using DDCMP (asyn-
    chronous/synchronous), or HDLC (synchronous only) data link pro-
    tocols

 Connections to the serial communication ports may be made:

 o  Locally - Using dedicated null modem wiring, or modem eliminators

 o  Remotely - Using modem connections over leased lines or dial-in Pub-
    lic Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) lines

                               DIGITAL                      May 1992

                                                         AE-PJM9A-TE

 

 The DEC WANrouter 150/250 software image is installed and configured
 on a VMS, VAX/ULTRIX, or RISC/ULTRIX system (termed a load host). The
 configured files are then down-line loaded from the host to the tar-
 get DSRVJ or DSRVR hardware over the LAN. Serial-line down loading is
 not supported in this release.

 The DEC WANrouter 150/250 software can be managed from any VMS or UL-
 TRIX end system using the DECnet Network Command Language (NCL), or
 the DEC Management Control Center (DECmcc). Monitoring of the Inter-
 net functions of the software can also be performed from a system sup-
 porting the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP/MIB II).

 DECnet Routing

 The DEC WANrouter 150/250 software implements IS-IS (link state rout-
 ing) as the DECnet/OSI Phase V routing protocol. Note that the DEC-
 net/OSI Phase V routing protocol also supports DECnet Phase IV endsys-
 tems.

 For backward compatibility, the DEC WANrouter 150/250 software also
 implements DECnet Phase IV routing (router vector routing).

 The DEC WANrouter 150/250 software supports both intra-area routing
 (Level 1) and inter-area routing (Level 2). The router can run either
 the Phase IV or Phase V routing algorithm in either combination at each
 level.

 Routers within the same DECnet area must use the same routing algo-
 rithms, either DECnet Phase IV or DECnet/OSI Phase V, but not both.

 Communication with other DECnet end systems or routers over the se-
 rial connections can use either DDCMP (synchronous or asynchronous),
 or HDLC (synchronous only) datalink circuits.

 If the routing circuit costs are set appropriately, the DEC WANrouter
 150/250 software performs path splitting across two (DSRVJ) and four
 (DSRVR) paths of equal cost. Note that routing cost is an arbitrary
 network management parameter set by the network manager to control net-
 work traffic flow. If the cost between the router and the destination

                                  2

 

 node is the same on multiple circuits, then the DEC WANrouter 150/250
 software splits the traffic across the circuits.

 Internet Routing

 The WANrouter 150/250 software provides support for the following IP
 routing protocols:

 o  RIP (Routing Information Protocol) for routing in pure TCP/IP en-
    vironments, as specified in RFC 1058. (Note that in DECnet Phase
    IV areas, where DECnet Phase IV routing algorithms are used, RIP
    should be used instead of integrated IS-IS.)

 o  Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGPs) as specified in RFCs 827, 888,
    and 904.

 o  Integrated Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) pro-
    tocol for routing in pure TCP/IP and dual environments, as spec-
    ified in RFC 1195.

 RFC 1195 is the OSI IS-IS Intra-Domain routing, with additions to sup-
 port IP routing as defined in RFC 1195. IP routers which do not sup-
 port IS-IS, RIP, or EGP can also be supported by manually configured
 IP Reachable Addresses (static routes) over serial or CSMA/CD circuits.

 When using Integrated IS-IS, the DEC WANrouter 150/250 software sup-
 ports equal-cost path splitting of IP data over equal-cost paths. Vari-
 able, but contiguous, IP subnet masks are also supported.

 IP hosts and gateways on the same CSMA/CD circuit as the DEC WANrouter
 150 or 250 are identified by the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) as
 described in RFC 826. Proxy ARP (RFC 1027) is also supported.

 The DEC WANrouter 150 and 250 can communicate directly with IP hosts
 or gateways over CSMA/CD circuits. They inter-operate with other IP
 gateways using RIP or EGP on these circuits.

 IP datagrams can be forwarded over:

 o  CSMA/CD circuits using Ethernet format packets

 o  Serial synchronous circuits using HDLC or DDCMP data links

                                  3

 

 o  Serial asynchronous circuits using DDCMP data links

 OSI Routing

 The DEC WANrouter 150/250 software fully implements the requirements
 of an OSI Intermediate System. The DEC WANrouter 150/250 exchanges in-
 formation about reachability of end systems using the OSI Intermedi-
 ate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) Intra-Domain Routing Exchange
 Protocol as specified in ISO/IEC 10589.

 OSI-compatible end systems on the same Local Area Network can exchange
 information with the DEC WANrouter 150/250 using the OSI End System
 to Intermediate System (ES-IS) Routing Exchange Protocol as specified
 in ISO 9542.

 The DEC WANrouter 150/250 software uses the OSI Connectionless Net-
 work Protocol (CLNP) as specified in ISO 8473 to communicate with OSI-
 compatible systems over an ISO 8802/3 or IEEE 802.3 Local Area Net-
 work. Communication over the serial links uses the synchronous HDLC
 data link protocol or the synchronous/asynchronous DDCMP data link pro-
 tocol.

 Installation and Configuration

 The minimum requirement is for one host to load the DSRVJ or DSRVR tar-
 get hardware. However, DEC WANrouter 150/250 software can be installed
 on a number of load hosts. This helps to protect against loss of ser-
 vice if a single load host is unavailable, or unable to load the sys-
 tem for any other reason.

 Installation is performed using VMSINSTAL (on VMS) or setld (on UL-
 TRIX). The router software must be configured using configuration pro-
 grams supplied with the product. These configuration programs allow
 the network manager to set up the downline load database, to define
 the required DEC WANrouter 150/250 entities, and produce an initial-
 ization script file. Once configured, the software image and initial-
 ization script file are down-line loaded to the target DSRVJ or DSRVR
 hardware unit.


                                  4

 

 The DSRVJ and DSRVR must be loaded using the Maintenance Operation Pro-
 tocol (MOP) via the IEEE802.3/Ethernet connection.

 The load host must be located on the same LAN or extended LAN as the
 DSRVJ or DSRVR hardware unit.

 Management

 The DEC WANrouter 150/250 software conforms to both the Digital En-
 terprise Management Architecture (EMA) and the Internet Structure of
 Management Information. Access to the manageable entities is supported
 using either the OSI Control Management Information Protocol (CMIP)
 or the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

 Permanent changes to the configuration of the DEC WANrouter 150/250
 software can be made by using the configuration utilities to create
 a script file and then downline loading these to the DSRVJ or DSRVR
 hardware unit. Temporary changes to the configuration of the DEC WAN-
 router 150/250 software can be made by using any EMA-compliant Direc-
 tor such as NCL or DECmcc from any available and supported end sys-
 tem. These temporary changes are lost when the hardware unit is re-
 loaded with the original script file.

 Other management tasks can also be be performed using NCL, allowing
 the network manager to:

 o  Manage specific connections (for example, set up the datalinks, en-
    able and disable circuits)

 o  Monitor network traffic (for example, enable event logging, dis-
    play counters)

 o  Resolve problems (for example, test circuit availability, perform
    loopback tests)

 Information about MIB II objects held on the DEC WANrouter 150/250 can
 also be accessed by Network Management systems using the Simple Net-
 work Management Protocol (SNMP). The DEC WANrouter 150/250 implements
 the Management Information Base (MIB-II) variables which can be read
 by a SNMP management station. Note that support is not provided for
 modifying these variables from an SNMP management station.

 Physical Line Support

 The DSRVR and DSRVJ hardware units contain an Ethernet interface port
 (IEEE 802.3 compatible). The DSRVR has eight synchronous/asynchronous
 serial communications ports. Six of these are 25-pin low-speed ports,
 and two are 50-pin multi-standard high-speed ports. The DSRVJ has two
 synchronous/asynchronous communications ports, one 25-pin low-speed,
 and one 50-pin multi-standard high-speed port.

 All 25-pin low-speed ports (up to 19.2Kbps maximum) only support the
 V.24/V.28 (EIA-232-D) ISO 2110, electrical and physical interface stan-
 dards.

 The 50-pin multi-standard high-speed (up to 64Kbps maximum) ports re-
 quire use of an appropriate adapter cable to support one of the fol-
 lowing electrical and physical interface standards:

 o  CCITT V.28/V.24 (EIA-RS232-C/D) - ISO 2110

 o  CCITT V.36/V.11 (EIA-RS422/449) - ISO 4902

 o  CCITT V.35 - ISO 2593

 o  CCITT V.10 (EIA-RS423/449) - ISO 4902

 o  CCITT V.11 - ISO 4903 (for British Telecom 64K Kilostream service
    only)

 Refer to the System Support Addendum (SSA 36.24.00-x) for details of
 the adapter cables.

 The number of lines and speeds supported simultaneously are shown in
 Table 1.

 Note that when any port is configured for V.28/V.24 (EIA-232-D/C) or
 asynchronous mode the speed is restricted to 19.2Kbps maximum.

 All serial ports operate in full-duplex mode and support full modem
 control for manually dialed, and auto answer modems conforming to Bell
 standards and CCITT recommendations, including V.22, V.22bis and V.32.
 These ports can operate as synchronous or asynchronous DDCMP point-
 to-point, or synchronous HDLC point-to-point links.

 Network Size and Supported Circuits

 DECnet Phase IV networks are hierarchical networks that can be seg-
 mented into up to 63 areas, each containing up to 1023 nodes. Note that
 these are maximum values permitted by the Digital Network Architec-
 ture, and that satisfactory operation in large networks requires proper
 network planning.

 DECnet/OSI Phase V Domains can be virtually unlimited. However, the
 actual size of a Domain is limited by the product's memory size and
 processor power. Table 2 lists the values of the parameters used to
 determine the size of the supported network for the DEC WANrouter 150
 (DSRVJ) and DEC WANrouter 250 (DSRVR).

 Note that these figures are given as a guide only. Actual sizes ex-
 perienced will depend on a number of factors including the topolog-
 ical characteristics of the network, the mix of protocols and data link
 interfaces, and the amount of routing control traffic generated by the

                                  7

 

 network. Consult your local Digital Sales office for more details and
 for assistance with network sizing and planning.

 Performance

                                 12

 

 The DEC WANrouter 150/250 products can saturate the band width of all
 serial lines at the speeds shown in Table 1 with packet sizes of 128
 bytes or greater. The actual performance of packets forwarded by any
 given DEC WANrouter 150/250 depends on many protocol and network topol-
 ogy considerations. Some of these considerations are:

 o  Mix of protocol types

 o  Type of traffic (routing updates or data packets) and data rates

 o  Communications line characteristics

 o  Frequency and type of errors on the synchronous or asynchronous links

 o  Network topology stability

 o  Protocol overhead
