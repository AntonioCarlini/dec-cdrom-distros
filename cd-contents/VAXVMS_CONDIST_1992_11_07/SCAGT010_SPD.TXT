 PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER System Census Agent          SPD 39.16.00
                for OpenVMS[*], Version 1.0

 DESCRIPTION

 The POLYCENTER System Census Agent for OpenVMS is a software layered
 product that resides on a system running the OpenVMS Operating Sys-
 tem. It collects available configuration information from the system
 and forwards the information to the Consolidator, which formats it into
 an SQL database and makes it available for presentation and access by
 other programs.

 The POLYCENTER System Census product set is described below, followed
 by a description of the POLYCENTER System Census Agent for OpenVMS.

 POLYCENTER System Census Product Set

 POLYCENTER System Census is a product set running on OpenVMS and UL-
 TRIX platforms. It is a Digital EMA-compliant product that fits in the
 "Configuration Management" function in the Digital POLYCENTER solu-
 tion suite of products. Its design intent is the automatic and peri-
 odic gathering of configuration information from the customer's com-
 plex, worldwide, multivendor, heterogeneous distributed systems, and
 the presentation of this information in graphic displays or through
 access by other application programs. The user thus gets current in-
 formation about the enterprise system and can use it for vital func-
 tions such as resource utilization, asset management, or inventory man-
 agement.

 The   terms VMS and OpenVMS refer to the OpenVMS Operating System.

 Specifically, POLYCENTER System Census provides the user with the abil-
 ity to:

 o  Discover, identify, and collect the configuration elements of en-
    terprisewide systems in a heterogeneous environment (OpenVMS and
    ULTRIX), using Agents running on individual systems. (See SPD 39.17.xx
    for information about the POLYCENTER System Census Agent for UL-
    TRIX.)

 o  Consolidate and organize the collected data in an SQL database (Rdb/VMS
    or ULTRIX/SQL), using the Consolidator running on system(s) where
    the enterprisewide configuration data is to be consolidated. In ad-
    dition, the consolidated SQL database also provides the ability to
    augment the collected data with user-defined data, and query and
    extract the consolidated data using a variety of SQL and 4GL tools.
    (See SPD 39.19.xx for information about the POLYCENTER System Cen-
    sus Consolidator for OpenVMS and SPD 39.20.xx for information about
    the POLYCENTER System Census Consolidator for ULTRIX.)

 o  Navigate and view the consolidated configuration data from the database
    via a DECwindows Motif(R)-based graphical user interface. (See SPD
    39.22.xx for information about the POLYCENTER System Census GUI for
    OpenVMS and SPD 39.23.00 for information about the POLYCENTER Sys-
    tem Census GUI for ULTRIX.)

 POLYCENTER System Census Agents are manageable from DECmcc, with the
 DECmcc 1.2 Director and the POLYCENTER System Census Agent Management
 Interface (MI).

 POLYCENTER System Census Agent for OpenVMS

 A POLYCENTER System Census Agent for OpenVMS runs on each OpenVMS sys-
 tem from which configuration data is to be collected. The configura-
 tion data collected in this release of the software consists of:

 o  Machine Group (a tightly or loosely coupled group of machines, e.g.,
    a VAXcluster system)

 o  Machine (a physical platform running an operating system)

 o  Processor (the CPU(s) that actually runs the machine)

                                  2

 

 o  Memory (the physical memory of a machine)

 o  Adapter (the physical adapters on the machines' buses)

 o  Controller (a network or device controller)

 o  Disk (physically connected)

 o  Tape (physically connected)

 o  Peers (HSC and ISE information)

 o  Servers (accessible PrintServers)

 o  Group (a group of users on a machine)

 o  User (user account information on a machine)

 o  User/Group (user-group relationship)

 o  Installed Software (operating system and layered product software)

 o  Licenses (from the LMF database)

 o  Queues (queues set up on a machine)

 o  Filesystem (the software representation of a mounted and format-
    ted disk or group of disks)

 o  Mountinfo (information that links filesystems and associated disk(s)
    to the machine(s) that the filesystem is mounted on)

 o  Network (network information for machine(s) and VAXcluster system(s))

 Once installed and started, the Agent on each system acts as a con-
 figuration data server, waiting for requests (via DECnet or TCP/IP)
 coming from any clients such as the Consolidator (which requests con-
 figuration data from multiple Agents and consolidates the data in an
 SQL database) or an EMA/DECmcc Director V1.2 using the MI (which pro-
 vides the ability to communicate with individual Agents and present
 the live configuration data using the DECmcc FCL or Iconic PMs).
