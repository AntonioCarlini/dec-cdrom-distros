 PRODUCT NAME:  CDD/Administrator for VMS, Version 1.1  SPD 32.72.01

 DESCRIPTION

 CDD/Administrator for VMS is a DECwindows Motif[R]-based, fully customiz-
 able, graphical management tool for CDD/Repository. It allows persons
 who manage or administer repositories to locate, query, manipulate,
 manage, and report on objects stored in CDD/Repository through a graph-
 ical interface.

 Features

 o  DECwindows Graphical Interface - Provides an easy-to-use means of
    defining, locating, querying, manipulating, and reporting on ob-
    jects in CDD/Repository.

 o  Multiple Navigator Styles - Allows the repository administrator to
    chose one or more styles of graphical interface in navigating the
    contents of a CDD/Repository. The two major styles of navigators
    are hierarchical navigators, which display objects in indented lists,
    and network navigators, which display objects in a graphical form.

 o  Accessible Editors - An appropriate editor for a given object can
    be invoked by simply "clicking" with the mouse from any navigator.
    Alternatively, the repository administrator can invoke an editor
    on an object directly.

 o  Customizable Editors - Repository administrators can change edi-
    tors to match characteristics of new or existing object types. Ed-
    itors can also be changed to display the appropriate information
    for various classes of users.

 o  Ad-hoc and Canned Reporting - Ad-hoc reporting provides the flex-
    ibility to create reports to do any necessary analysis. Standard
    reports provide cost-effective reporting for repetitive repository
    administrative tasks. The standard report files can be created from
    any VAX VMS platform, whether DECwindows-based or not.

 o  Customized Reports - Customized reports can be created covering any
    objects stored in CDD/Repository, including any user-made exten-
    sions. This provides cost-effective support for user-specific, frequently-
    used reports as well as support for less sophisticated users.

 o  Keywords - Can be defined and associated with objects stored in CDD/Repository
    and used in locating, querying, and reporting in CDD/Administrator.
    Keywords created through CDD/Administrator can also be used by any
    application layered on top of CDD/Repository.

 o  Work in Multiple Workspaces - Allows the repository administrator
    to switch between multiple workspaces or "contexts" within CDD/Repository.

 o  CDD/Repository Extensions - Repository administrators can extend
    CDD/Repository by adding new objects, protocols, or methods to an
    individual repository, or multiple repositories through the same
    graphical interface used to manage existing objects in CDD/Repository.

 o  Code Generator for Repository Extensions - Enables consistent de-
    scription of repository extensions across multiple repositories and
    in new repositories. Resultant executable images can be run on in-
    stallations of CSO's products to ensure accurate description of ex-
    tensions every time an installation or upgrade is performed.

 o  Callable Interface - Allows the use of the functionality of CDD/Administrator
    in CSO's products. This provides a consistent "look and feel" to
    navigators, editors, and reports layered on CDD/Repository across
    multiple tools and platforms.
