 PRODUCT NAME:  DECinspect                              SPD 26.N2.01
                Security Reporting Facility for VMS, Ver-
                sion 2.0

 DESCRIPTION

 DECinspect Security Reporting Facility (DECinspect SRF) is a security
 reporting tool that collects and manages security compliance and se-
 curity event information sent from the following software tools:

 o  DECinspect Compliance Manager (DECinspect CM) for VMS (SPD 26.N1.xx)

 o  DECinspect Compliance Manager (DECinspect CM) for ULTRIX (SPD 41.26.xx)

 o  DECinspect Compliance Manager (DECinspect CM) for SunOS[TM] (SPD
    41.25.xx)

 o  DECinspect Intrusion Detector (DECinspect ID) for VMS (SPD 41.27.xx)

 DECinspect SRF software runs on one or more nodes to support central-
 ized collection and management of security compliance data from nodes
 running DECinspect CM and security events data from nodes running DECin-
 spect ID.

 DECinspect CM software, a compliance management tool, runs on VMS, UL-
 TRIX, and SunOS nodes in a customer's network and periodically eval-
 uates compliance with a baseline security policy defined for that node's
 operating system. Optionally, DECinspect CM forwards the compliance
 data to the DECinspect SRF node.

 DECinspect ID software, an intrusion detection tool, runs on VMS nodes
 in a customer's network and notifies security managers about security
 events occurring on the node. Optionally, the data is sent to the DECin-
 spect SRF node, where the designated DECinspect SRF adminstrator is
 notified about these events.

                                                         AE-PGC6B-TE

 

 With these tools, the security manager can implement and maintain a
 security policy for nodes running the VMS, ULTRIX, or SunOS operat-
 ing systems.

 While DECinspect CM can be used alone in small distributed systems,
 the centralized management capabilities of DECinspect SRF can be very
 helpful in managing a large number of nodes or a set of nodes on a dis-
 persed network.

 If centralized management is desired, the customer will establish one
 or more DECinspect SRF installations on the network. Typically, DECin-
 spect SRF installations are set up to support the organizational re-
 porting structure (for example, one DECinspect SRF node for each or-
 ganizational management domain).

 DECinspect SRF software performs integrity checks to prevent unautho-
 rized modification of tokens transmitted from DECinspect CM and DECin-
 spect ID installations.

 Once the system is configured, the DECinspect SRF software collects
 the tokens and automatically stores the data in a relational database.

 The database stores the following security compliance data:

 o  Node name

 o  Network address

 o  Cluster name

 o  Summary status of DECinspect CM test collection results

 o  Detailed status of DECinspect CM test collection results

 o  Status of policy file in use

 o  DECinspect CM policy file information

 o  Operating system

 o  Operating system version

 o  DECinspect CM version

 o  Inspection date

                                  2

 

 o  Received date

 The DECinspect SRF software stores the compliance data so designated
 users can access current as well as historical data to manage the se-
 curity compliance of nodes on the network.

 The database stores the following security event data:

 o  Node name

 o  Network address

 o  Target entity

 o  Source entity

 o  Alarm time

 o  Received time

 o  Failure type

 o  Failure limit

 o  Security contact information

    -  Name

    -  Location

    -  Electronic mail address

    -  Phone-1

    -  Phone-2

 The DECinspect SRF software stores the security event data so desig-
 nated users can access current as well as historical data to monitor
 the security events occurring on VMS nodes in the network.

 The security manager can use the DECinspect SRF software to:

 o  Display the security status of any VMS, ULTRIX, or SunOS node within
    the management domain of a particular DECinspect SRF installation.

 o  Automatically notify system managers and group managers about the
    compliance status of their node or cluster via electronic mail.

                                  3

 

 o  Automatically notify system managers and group managers about miss-
    ing compliance status information via electronic mail.

 o  Produce reports about the compliance status of nodes or groups.

 o  Produce reports about missing compliance status information.

 o  Produce reports about implementation trends of the DECinspect CM
    product on different platforms.

 o  Display and produce reports from information in the DECinspect SRF
    database.

 o  Forward tokens to another DECinspect SRF installation automatically
    in a reporting structure consistent with the customer's organiza-
    tional structure.

 o  Store and access data about the manager responsible for a node or
    a group of nodes.

 o  Store and access data about valid policy files used by the nodes
    running DECinspect CM software. DECinspect CM policy files contain
    the settings established by the security manager consistent with
    the organization's baseline security policy. DECinspect SRF works
    with DECinspect CM to perform integrity checks to protect against
    unauthorized modification of DECinspect CM policy files.

 o  Schedule tasks, such as producing reports or forwarding tokens, to
    run automatically.

 The security managers can also write their own programs to extract data
 from other sources for storage in the DECinspect SRF database as well
 as produce other reports using any of the following Digital software
 products:

    RDO and SQL utilities of VAX Rdb/VMS (SPD 25.59.xx)
    VAX Rdb/VMS precompilers (SPD 25.59.xx)
    VAX DATATRIEVE (SPD 25.44.xx)
    VAX RALLY (SPD 27.03.xx)
    VAX TEAMDATA (SPD 27.02.xx)
    DECdecision (SPD 25.62.xx)
