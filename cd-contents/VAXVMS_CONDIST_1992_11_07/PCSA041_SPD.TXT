 PRODUCT NAME:  PATHWORKS for VMS, Version 4.1          SPD 30.50.10

 DESCRIPTION

 PATHWORKS for VMS is based on the Personal Computing Systems Archi-
 tecture (PCSA), which is an extension of Digital Equipment Corpora-
 tion's systems and networking architecture that merges the VAX, RISC,
 and personal computer environments. The PATHWORKS product family, de-
 veloped under the PCSA architecture, provides a framework for inte-
 grating personal computers into an organization's total information
 system so different types of users can share information and network
 services across the entire organization.

 The PATHWORKS family of software products includes:

 o  PATHWORKS for VMS - Software that allows a VMS-based VAX system to
    act as a file, print, mail and disk server to DOS- and OS/2[R]-based
    personal computers.

 o  PATHWORKS for ULTRIX - Software that allows an ULTRIX-based VAX or
    RISC system to act as a file, print and mail server to DOS- and OS/2-
    based personal computers. (Described in SPD 32.44.xx.)

 o  PATHWORKS for OS/2 - Software that allows a personal computer run-
    ning the OS/2 Operating System to use the facilities provided by
    PATHWORKS for VMS, PATHWORKS for ULTRIX, or the PATHWORKS for OS/2
    server software. Also included is server software that allows an
    OS/2- based personal computer to act as a file, print and mail server
    to other personal computers. (Described in SPD 55.24.xx.)

 o  PATHWORKS for Macintosh[R] - Software that allows a VMS-based VAX sys-
    tem to act as a file or print server to Macintosh computers. Also
    included are Macintosh client applications and utilities. (Described
    in SPD 31.53.xx.)

                                                         AE-HD94K-TK

 

 o  PATHWORKS for DOS - Software that allows a personal computer run-
    ning the DOS Operating System to use the facilities provided by PATH-
    WORKS for VMS, PATHWORKS for ULTRIX, or the PATHWORKS for OS/2 server
    software. (Described in SPD 55.07.xx.)

 o  PATHWORKS for DOS (TCP/IP) - Software required for a personal com-
    puter running the DOS Operating System to access services of a PATHWORKS
    for VMS or PATHWORKS for ULTRIX server via the TCP/IP network trans-
    port. (Described in SPD 33.45.xx.)

 o  DECnet/PCSA Client: VAXmate - Required software for VAXmate or/ com-
    puters to use the facilities provided by PATHWORKS for VMS. (De-
    scribed in SPD 55.10.xx.)

 PATHWORKS for VMS software allows VAX, MicroVAX, VAXstation and VAXserver
 computers to act as application, data and resource servers to groups
 of personal computers. By using these server systems, personal com-
 puters can share applications, data and resources. Information can be
 accessed from local and remote systems and applied in DOS or OS/2 ap-
 plications.

 PATHWORKS for VMS supports DECnet, LAST, and TCP/IP network transports
 in Local Area Network (LAN) environments, and DECnet and TCP/IP in Wide
 Area Network (WAN) environments.

 PATHWORKS for VMS can be used in an Ethernet or 802.5 Token Ring Net-
 work with VMS that supports these topologies, with transports that sup-
 port these topologies and the appropriate server hardware. Refer to
 the HARDWARE section in the SSA, and to the VMS Operating System SPD
 (SPD 25.01.xx) and the DECnet-VAX SPD (SPD 25.03.xx).

 Note: For the purposes of this Software Product Description, the term
 "DOS" refers to all disk operating system software supported by PATH-
 WORKS for DOS software. (Refer to System Support Addendum SSA 55.07.xx-
 x.) The term "OS/2" refers to all operating system software supported
 by PATHWORKS for OS/2 software. (Refer to SPD 55.24.xx.)

 Network Transport Support

 PATHWORKS for VMS supports DECnet, LAST, and TCP/IP network transport
 software.

 DECnet

 The DECnet transport is provided with the VMS Operating System. Us-
 ing DECnet, supported personal computer clients can access servers in
 both local area and wide area networks. Refer to the PATHWORKS for DOS
 and PATHWORKS for OS/2 Software Product Descriptions for detailed in-
 formation on supported features. Using DECnet as a transport, PATH-
 WORKS for VMS provides file, print, mail, time and date services to
 supported clients.

 TCP/IP

                                  3

 

 Support for TCP/IP is available using the VMS/ULTRIX Connection prod-
 uct. PATHWORKS clients accessing PATHWORKS for VMS via TCP/IP can use
 file and print services only. Refer to PATHWORKS for DOS (TCP/IP) SPD
 33.45.xx for details.

 LAST

 LAST is a high performance Local Area Network protocol supported by
 PATHWORKS for VMS that provides file, print, and disk services. LAST
 does not support Wide Area Network functionality or extended LANS us-
 ing bridges with speeds less then 10 Mb/seconds.

 Refer to the SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS section of this document for in-
 formation on required network transport software.

 NetBIOS Interface Support

 PATHWORKS for VMS makes use of NetBIOS naming services and datagram
 service, however, a NetBIOS programming interface is not provided.

 PATHWORKS for VMS supports the NetBIOS interface in TCP/IP Networks.
 That is a B-node RFC 1001/1002 compliant implementation. This means
 that the NetBIOS interface is supported under TCP/IP in Local Area Net-
 work (LAN) environments only.

 File Services

 PATHWORKS for VMS file services provides DOS and OS/2 clients with a
 remote file system that appears as a transparent extension of the client
 system's local computing environment.

 PATHWORKS for VMS file services are based on the Microsoft[R] LAN Man-
 ager SMB (Server Message Block) protocols.

 Each DOS or OS/2 file stored through the file service is stored as a
 VMS file: either an RMS Stream file or an RMS Sequential Fixed Length
 Record (512 record bytes) file type. The files stored through the file
 service are accessible to PC clients, VMS users, and to applications
 that can interpret the content and organization of the file written
 by the client application. Each read issued by the client application

                                  4

 

 will result in the presentation to the application of the next "n" re-
 quested data bytes contained sequentially in the file.

 Multiple DOS and OS/2 clients can concurrently access files stored on
 the server's disk through the file access modes and byte range lock-
 ing support provided by the server as defined by Microsoft's SMB pro-
 tocol.

 Through the use of the VMS Lock Manager, VMS and PC-based applications
 can control file access. Refer to the Server Management and Control
 section of this SPD for further information on access control.

 Restrictions

 The DOS and OS/2 utilities specific to PC hardware devices cannot be
 used with file services, such as CHKDSK, FDISK, DISKCOPY, DISKCOMP,
 and FORMAT.

 DOS filenames containing two sequential underscores (__) are not sup-
 ported by PATHWORKS for VMS. This is a restricted character sequence
 for use by the Server only.

 Disk Services

 Through Digital's Local Area Systems Transport (LAST), PATHWORKS for
 VMS software provides PC clients with local area disk services. The
 local area disk service defines a space on a VMS disk for clients to
 access as a virtual disk. This virtual disk is formatted as an OS/2
 or DOS disk. Because LAST is a LAN-only communications protocol, over-
 head is low and performance high.

 Local area disk services are accessible through the PATHWORKS for DOS
 client and PATHWORKS for OS/2 client software using LAST in a Local
 Area Network (LAN) and through the Network Disk Utility (NDU) using
 DECnet in a Wide Area Network (WAN). PATHWORKS for DOS and PATHWORKS
 for OS/2 client software can also access virtual disks created with
 NDU. Access to local area disks in extended LANs across bridges with
 a transfer speed of 10Mb/seconds or less is NOT provided.

 Disk management may be completed from the VAX or remotely from the per-
 sonal computer.

                                  5

 

 The local area disk service has the following restrictions:

 o  Only one client at a time may have read and write access to the lo-
    cal area disk.

 o  Multiple readers (and no writers) to a local area disk are allowed.

 o  The DOS and OS/2 files cannot be shared with VMS users.

 o  The local area disk service is available only in a Local Area Net-
    work configuration. However, virtual disks created with the local
    area disk service are available in a Wide Area Network through the
    Network Device Utility (NDU).

 The local area disk's size is established at its creation and can be
 360K bytes, 720K bytes, 1.2M bytes, 1.44M bytes, 5M bytes, 10M bytes,
 20M bytes, or 32M bytes, 64M bytes, 128M bytes, 256M bytes, 512M bytes.
 Refer to the Server Management and Control section, for further in-
 formation on access control.

 Print Services

 PATHWORKS for VMS software allows DOS, OS/2, and VMS users to share
 printers connected to a VAXserver, VAXcluster, or supported terminal
 servers in a LAN or WAN. PATHWORKS clients can send files to the re-
 mote printer from DOS, OS/2, Microsoft Windows (DOS clients only), or
 from applications. PC clients can also delete a remote print entry and
 can associate some VMS printing parameters with a redirected logical
 print device.

 The system administrator assigns a service name to a VMS print queue
 and can define user access to the print service. The PATHWORKS for DOS
 client and PATHWORKS for OS/2 client software redirect printer I/O from
 a client printer port to a defined print service.

 The system administrator's utility in PATHWORKS for VMS software cre-
 ates the physical and generic queues as well as defines forms for se-
 lected Digital and third-party printers. Refer to the OPTIONAL HARD-
 WARE section in the SSA for details.

                                  6

 

 Multiple print services may be set up for the same printer. For ex-
 ample, a landscape service and a portrait service may be created for
 the same LN03 PLUS printer. In addition, other printer queues can be
 manually set to support additional Digital and third-party printers
 that are not listed in the menus.

 Mail Services

 The mail server that is part of PATHWORKS for VMS provides DOS and OS/2
 clients with the ability to send and receive electronic mail messages.
 A mail account is established on the VMS server for each PC client.
 Mail can be sent to this account by other PC clients as well as users
 of VMS mail software. The mail server then routes messages to the ap-
 propriate client when the client logs onto the server.

 The PATHWORKS for VMS mail server provides the PC user with folders,
 distribution lists, and delivery capabilities. Notification of new mes-
 sages occurs both real-time and upon login to a network session. Real-
 time notification of incoming messages can be optionally disabled by
 the client.

 PATHWORKS for VMS allows PC users to read mail without having to log
 in to the VMS system. The mail utility is based on the MAIL-11 prod-
 uct. Refer to the Network Transport Support section for PATHWORKS mail
 functionality by transport.

 Time and Date Services

 DOS and OS/2 clients can request date and time information from the
 server system to set the local workstation date and time.

 Server Management and Control

 Two types of server management interface are provided by PATHWORKS for
 VMS, a menu-driven user interface and a command line interface.

 The Manager Menu is a PC-style menu interface that requires only min-
 imal knowledge of VMS Operating System commands. The Manager Menu al-
 lows the system administrator to manage file and print services, user
 accounts, and the client workstation database. Users can also create

                                  7

 

 groups of users and grant these groups access to file, disk, and print
 services.

 Service and file access is supported across a VAXcluster, however, re-
 fer to the section on Cluster Environment Support for specifics. In
 a VAXcluster, a common database must be used for the cluster. Access
 to the file service is determined via standard VMS file access autho-
 rization mechanisms.

 Print service access is controlled through username, password, and VMS
 Access Control Lists.

 Access to the disk service is controlled via passwords, and the as-
 signment of read-only or read/write privileges to users of a local area
 disk service.

 PATHWORKS for VMS also includes a DOS file maintenance utility called
 PCDISK that can be used to maintain DOS devices accessible to VMS. This
 would include virtual disk files, LAD disk services, and physical diskette
 devices on the VMS server. The interface is DOS-like, while VMS-style
 prompting, line editing, and HELP are available. It supports wildcard
 file transfer between DOS devices and the VMS file system.

 The system administrator can restrict the number of simultaneous client
 connections to a given service on the server. This capability means
 the system administrator can restrict access to DOS or OS/2 applica-
 tions stored in the directory to aid the system administrator in com-
 plying with vendor licensing agreements. Other restrictions on the use
 of the server can be imposed to help meet performance and security goals.

 An administrator's utility is provided to allow the system adminis-
 trator to add and remove services, register clients, and list resources.
 The server software can list current connections, current file opens,
 current sessions, and current services available, as well as show var-
 ious counters. The server also provides for the use of broadcast in-
 formation to all actively connected clients that are configured to use
 RECEIVE. (For limitations, refer to the Broadcast Utilities Section.)

 PATHWORKS for VMS also includes an automated configuration utility.

                                  8

 

 In addition, the Manager Menu can be used to view the following log
 file:

 o  Server log file that tracks network and server events, such as no-
    tices about connections being opened and closed, and failed attempts
    to access server resources.

 The server administrator can also use the command line interface to
 control features and services that are also accessible via menus. The
 command line interface can also be invoked by batch, allowing the user
 to create automated command procedures.

 Broadcast Utility

 PATHWORKS for VMS includes a message broadcast facility that allows
 the system administrator to send messages to workstations in the lo-
 cal area network. A message can be sent to a single client or to all
 currently active clients in the LAN.

 The broadcast utility can be used to inform users of system events,
 such as the creation of new services or the shutdown of the system.
 This feature is not currently available to 802.5 Token Ring LAN Users.

 Remote Boot Services (DOS Clients Only)

 PATHWORKS for VMS software also enables remote boot for VAXmates and
 DOS personal computers with Digital's DEPCA or DEMCA PC Ethernet con-
 trollers. DOS personal computers using other supported Ethernet con-
 trollers can remote boot utilizing the supplied Remote Boot Software
 diskette. The administrator's utility provides facilities to add, delete,
 and list workstations to be booted remotely. LAST disk services on a
 LAN is a prerequisite.
