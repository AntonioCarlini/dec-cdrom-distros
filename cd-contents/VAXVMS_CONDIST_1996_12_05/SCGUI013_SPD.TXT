PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER[TM] System Census, Version 1.3        SPD
39.19.02

DESCRIPTION

POLYCENTER System Census product set is comprised of POLYCENTER Sys-
tem Census for OpenVMS AXP, OpenVMS VAX, and ULTRIX RISC, as well as
a companion product, POLYCENTER System Census for PC LANs (SPD 50.72.xx).
It is a configuration management and software asset management prod-
uct within Digital's POLYCENTER portfolio of networked system manage-
ment products. It provides automatic and periodic gathering of con-
figuration information from worldwide, heterogeneous distributed sys-
tems, and presents this information in graphic displays and reports.
This information can be used for critical system management functions
such as asset management, inventory management, and resource utiliza-
tion analysis.

POLYCENTER System Census collects, consolidates, and presents the con-
figuration information from the OpenVMS AXP, OpenVMS VAX, or ULTRIX
RISC systems within the enterprise. When POLYCENTER System Census is
deployed with POLYCENTER System Census for PC LANs (SPD 50.72.xx), all
MS-DOS[R], Windows[R], OS/2[R], and Macintosh [R] PC information is
also collected and consolidated with the enterprise data on an Open-
VMS AXP or OpenVMS VAX system.

Specifically, POLYCENTER System Census provides the user with the abil-
ity to:

o  Discover, identify, and collect the configuration information from
   enterprise-wide systems through software agents running on Open-
   VMS AXP, OpenVMS VAX, and ULTRIX RISC systems.

POLYCENTER[TM] System Census, Version 1.3              SPD 39.19.02


o  Consolidate and organize the collected data from OpenVMS AXP, Open-
   VMS VAX, and ULTRIX systems using an SQL compliant database (Rdb/VMS[TM]
   for OpenVMS AXP and OpenVMS VAX. In addition, information from MS-DOS
   and Windows, OS/2, and Macintosh PC clients running in the PATH-
   WORKS[TM] for DOS[R] or Novell[R] NetWare[R] PC LANs can also be
   consolidated into this database by installing a companion product,
   the POLYCENTER System Census for PC LANs (SPD 50.72.xx). The con-
   solidated SQL compliant database provides the ability to augment
   the collected data with user-defined data as well as the ability
   to query and extract the data using a variety of SQL and 4GL tools.

o  Navigate through and view the consolidated configuration informa-
   tion through a graphical user interface (GUI). A DECwindows[TM] Mo-
   tif[R] based GUI on an OpenVMS AXP, or OpenVMS VAX, system allows
   you to look at data from OpenVMS AXP, OpenVMS VAX systems, and UL-
   TRIX RISC systems, plus MS-DOS, OS/2, Macintosh, and Windows PCs.

The rest of this document describes the POLYCENTER System Census for
OpenVMS AXP, OpenVMS VAX, and ULTRIX RISC systems. Please refer to the
Software Product Description (SPD 50.72.xx) for the description of the
POLYCENTER System Census for PC LANs.

AGENTS

A POLYCENTER System Census Agent runs on each OpenVMS AXP, OpenVMS VAX,
or ULTRIX RISC system from which the configuration data is to be col-
lected. The configuration data collected in this release of the soft-
ware includes:

o  Machine Group (a tightly or loosely coupled group of machines, for
   example, a VAXcluster[TM] system)

o  Machine (a physical platform running an operating system)

o  Processor (the CPU(s) that actually runs the machine)

o  Memory (the physical memory of a machine)

o  Adapter (the physical adapters on the machines' buses)

o  Controller (a network or device controller)

                                 2

 



POLYCENTER[TM] System Census, Version 1.3              SPD 39.19.02


o  Disk (physically connected)

o  Tape (physically connected)

o  Peers (HSC and ISE information for OpenVMS, ISE only for ULTRIX RISC)

o  Servers (accessible PrintServers[TM])

o  Group (a group of users on a machine)

o  User (user account information on a machine)

o  User/Group (user-group relationship)

o  Installed Software (operating system and layered product software)

o  Licenses (from the LMF database)

o  Queues (queues set up on a machine)

o  Filesystem (the software representation of a mounted and format-
   ted disk or group of disks)

o  Mountinfo (information that links filesystems and associated disk(s)
   to the machine(s) that the filesystem is mounted on)

o  Network (network information for machine(s) and VAXcluster system(s))

Once installed and started, the Agent on each system acts as a con-
figuration data server waiting for requests coming from the POLYCEN-
TER System Census Consolidator. The OpenVMS AXP and OpenVMS VAX Agents
require DECnet[TM] and the ULTRIX RISC Agent requires TCP/IP for client
communications.

CONSOLIDATOR

The Consolidator requests configuration data from multiple Agents and
consolidates the data in an SQL compliant database. Rdb/VMS is used
by the OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS AXP Consolidators as their database.
The Consolidator is given a user-defined collection schedule and the
set of systems from which to consolidate the data. DECnet transport
is used to consolidate data from target systems. If used with POLY-
CENTER System Census for PC LANs, DECnet or TCP/IP can be used to con-
solidate data from the PC LANs.

POLYCENTER[TM] System Census, Version 1.3              SPD 39.19.02


The consolidated data can be used for analysis, report generation, or
graphical visualization using the Graphical User Interface (GUI). Once
the database has been loaded, the user can query and generate exten-
sive reports using SQL or 4GL tools available on the system or use the
basic reporting capability provided by the Consolidator and the GUI.

The Consolidator database can maintain multiple versions of data from
each Agent, providing a history of configuration changes. The number
of versions of data kept for each Agent is user selectable.

GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE (GUI)

POLYCENTER System Census GUI is a DECwindows Motif based graphical user
interface that displays the stored information from the Consolidator-
generated SQL compliant database. The user can navigate within the enterprise-
wide configuration data and obtain various categories of configura-
tion information such as hardware, software, user, license, filesys-
tem, and queues.

A context-sensitive online Motif Help system is provided to help the
user during navigation. The GUI allows the user to extract the con-
figuration data into a variety of forms: hardcopy PostScript, text,
and compound document (DDIF) formats. It also allows users to augment
the configuration data with user-supplied data, enabling the users to
attach Configuration Notes to the automatically collected data.

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

Note:  It is recommened that you use a system more powerful than a VAXs-
tation 3100 for the Consolidator and GUI.

Alpha AXP Systems

This product is distributed on the Digital CD-ROM Software Library for
OpenVMS AXP.

ORDERING INFORMATION

An Agent license is required for each OpenVMS AXP, OpenVMS VAX and UL-
TRIX RISC node from which data needs to be collected.

One Consolidator can collect data from several OpenVMS AXP Agents, Open-
VMS VAX Agents, ULTRIX RISC Agents, and PC LANs. The Consolidator can
be bought either with an "Unlimited Use" license or with a "Concur-
rent Use" license, where each Agent node or PC LAN (defined as one LAN
Auditor database) is treated as one "Concurrent Use". If a "Concur-
rent Use" license is bought for the Consolidator, one must buy enough
license units for the Consolidator to cover all the Agents and PC LANs.

The GUI can also be bought with an "Unlimited Use" license or a "Per-
sonal Use" license. The "Unlimited Use" license allows an unlimited
number of users to run the GUI simultaneously on a system. If a "Per-
sonal Use" license is bought for the GUI, one must buy enough license
units to match the number of users using the GUI at the same time.
