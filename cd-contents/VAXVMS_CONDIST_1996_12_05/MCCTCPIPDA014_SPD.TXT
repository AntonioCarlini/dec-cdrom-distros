          PRODUCT NAME:  POLYCENTER Fault Diagnostic Package, Version 1.4 SPD
                                  (formerly DECmcc Fault Diagnostic Pack-
          39.72.02                age)

          INTRODUCTION

          POLYCENTER Fault Diagnostic Package is one of several packages of
          POLYCENTER Management Modules that can be used in conjunction with a
          prepackaged POLYCENTER Product Family Management System. The
          POLYCENTER Module Packages provide management functions and protocol
          support for generic and specific network and system-managed object
          environments.

          POLYCENTER Module Packages can be installed on a POLYCENTER Framework
          and used individually or in combination with one another. The manage-
          ment services provided by a newly installed module or module package
          are enrolled as part of the POLYCENTER Framework Software and are
          available to management services already installed.

          POLYCENTER Framework software is the minimum prerequisite software
          product for POLYCENTER Management Module Packages such as the Fault
          Diagnostic Package. The Fault Diagnostic Package can also be
          installed on a POLYCENTER Network Manager 200 and is available in
          OpenVMS VAX and RISC/ULTRIX versions.

          Refer to the POLYCENTER Management Services Software Product Descrip-
          tion (SPD 37.20.xx) for a list of the POLYCENTER products and module
          packages and a description of their relationship to each other.

          POLYCENTER Fault Diagnostic Package, Version 1.4      SPD 39.72.02
          (formerly DECmcc Fault Diagnostic Package)

          DESCRIPTION

          The POLYCENTER Fault Diagnostic Package is a troubleshooting tool de-
          signed to simplify the process of isolating and quickly resolving some
          of the most frequently occurring TCP/IP network problems, minimizing
          down-time and maximizing network efficiency. It uses common UNIX Util-
          ities and Bourne Shell scripts to retrieve information about a TCP/IP
          network.

          The POLYCENTER Fault Diagnostic Package is comprised of ten diagnos-
          tic routines, a load check utility, a path trace utility, and a ping
          utility. The diagnostic routines are:

          o  Diagnose host_unknown

          o  Diagnose host_unreachable

          o  Diagnose inetdaemon

          o  Diagnose network_unreachable

          o  Diagnose nfs_problem

          o  Diagnose rcp_denied

          o  Diagnose rlogin_denied

          o  Diagnose rsh_denied

          o  Diagnose telnet_refused

          o  Diagnose telnet_timeout

          These routines are designed to help users isolate network faults such
          as component failures, improperly set parameters, and improper file
          protections. When a diagnostic routine is executed, the Fault Diag-
          nostic software determines the tests to execute. After the tests are
          executed, it produces a report containing test results and the rec-
          ommended actions an operator should take to troubleshoot or repair the
          problem.

          (formerly DECmcc Fault Diagnostic Package)

          The POLYCENTER Fault Diagnostic Package can diagnose problems between
          the station on which POLYCENTER resides and a remote host, or between
          two hosts that are remote from the POLYCENTER station (i.e., the POLY-
          CENTER station resides on a third host which is not involved in the
          reported problem).

          OPTIONAL HARDWARE

          VT1300 and VT2000 Color Terminals are supported.

          CLUSTER ENVIRONMENT

          This layered product is fully supported when installed on any valid
          and licensed VAXcluster* configuration without restrictions. The HARD-
          WARE REQUIREMENTS section details any special hardware required by
          this product.

          *  V5.x VAXcluster configurations are fully described in the VAXclus-
             ter Software Product Description (29.78.xx) and include CI, Eth-
             ernet, and Mixed Interconnect configurations.

          IMPORTANT INTEROPERABILITY INFORMATION FOR OPENVMS USERS ONLY

          Interoperability problems may occur when more than one product con-
          taining DECthreads is installed on a system. This occurs because some
          products overwrite the system version of DECthreads. If a product with
          a different version of DECthreads is installed after POLYCENTER Frame-
          work, problems may occur.

          POLYCENTER Framework V1.4 is linked with DECthreads V1.0-422. Later
          versions of DECthreads have a backwards compatible API. Consequently,
          no problem should result from having a more recent version of
          DECthreads on the system.
