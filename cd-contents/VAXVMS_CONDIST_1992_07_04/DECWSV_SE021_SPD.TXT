          PRODUCT NAME:  VMS DECwindows/Svenska V2.1             SPD 26.A1.01



          DESCRIPTION

             VMS DECwindows/Svenska, is the Swedish language interface
             to the VMS DECwindows product. VMS DECwindows is included
             with the VMS Operating System. A prerequisite for running
             VMS DECwindows/Svenska is the VMS Operating System and VMS
             DECwindows.

             This VMS DECwindows/Svenska product provides a language
             interface to the DECwindows desktop environment.

             This environment consists of four basic components:

             o  The Session Manager provides the top-level user interface
                to a DECwindows workstation. It performs application
                activation, session-wide customization, screen printing,
                security management and session control.

             o  The Window Manager provides user control for managing
                windows.

             o  FileView is a graphical interface to VMS file management
                that allows users to navigate through the VMS file system
                and perform operations on files.

             o  The DECterm terminal emulator provides workstation users
                with a traditional character cell interface for existing VMS
                features and applications.

          A set of integrated desktop applications is also provided as a
          component of the DECwindows environment. The applications are:

                are distributed and stored online.
