PRODUCT NAME: VAX Distributed Name Service, Version 1.1   SPD 28.79.01

DESCRIPTION

The VAX Distributed Name Service (DNS) provides selected DIGITAL 
products with a DECnet-wide name-to-attribute mapping service.

DNS presents and maintains a consistent, network-wide set of names for 
network resources, called the namespace. These names are constructed without
including any location information in them, thus permitting users to 
reference these network resources independent of their physical location.

A single DNS node can provide a DECnet-wide name service. DNS can be 
installed on additional nodes in a network to provide availability and
performance benefits. As a general rule, it is suggested that DNS be 
placed on two nodes in each local area network. This should provide adequate
performance and redundancy for most networks.

The VAX Distributed Name Service is used by selected DIGITAL products only, 
as noted in their SPDs.

Features

The following is a summary of features available with the VAX Distributed 
Name Service:

^  DNS provides a network-wide name-to-attribute mapping service which 
   allows selected DIGITAL applications to create, read, modify, and delete
   names in the namespace.

^  DNS can store and manage a large number of names using a hierarchical 
   structure.

^  Overall availability and performance of the name service can be enhanced 
   by installing DNS on multiple nodes. DNS automatically maintains 
   consistency of the namespace across all DNS nodes.

^  DNS provides access control to each name in the namespace. This set of 
   access control rights consists of read, write, delete, test, and
   control.

^  The DNS management control program controls DNS operation and displays 
   statistical and error information.

^  DNS provides network event logging using the standard DECnet-VAX event 
   logging facility. The DECnet-VAX NCP utility can be used to enable and
   disable DNS events.
