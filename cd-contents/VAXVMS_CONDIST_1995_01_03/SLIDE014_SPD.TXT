          PRODUCT NAME:  VAX DECslide, Version 1.4            SPD 26.11.09

          DESCRIPTION

          VAX DECslide is a menu-driven graphic presentation utility that
          runs on the VMS Operating System. It is intended for individuals
          who create or prepare materials for in-house presentations. A
          combination of symbols and text are used for menu selection.

          VAX DECslide uses an interactive interface so that diagrams and
          text are displayed as they are entered. Editing functions permit
          changes to slides as they are created, or after they have been
          saved.

          A strip (text) menu and message area at the bottom of the screen
          displays user options, help messages, and operation status. A
          directory feature lists the slides, including the date and time
          of creation, slide name and comments.

          After slides are created, they can be colored with available
          color palettes. They can be printed (single or double size
          format), saved (filed), copied, exported, changed, or deleted.

          Slides are saved in the current default VMS directory. Different
          directories can be used to group common slides together, and all
          are protected via the standard VMS protection mechanisms.

          Features

          VAX DECslide supports the following object types:

          o  Circle (can be dimensioned to an ellipse)

          o  Straight line (solid, dashed, dotted, dash/dot in various
             combinations)

          VAX DECslide, Version 1.4                           SPD 26.11.09



          o  Box (can be dimensioned to a rectangle)

          o  Triangle

          o  Polygon

          o  Arc

          o  Text

          Objects can be manipulated in the following ways:

          o  Single objects (shapes) can be combined to form more complex,
             compound objects.

          o  Both single and compound objects can be copied, rotated,
             moved, redimensioned, separated or joined together.

          o  Height and width can be increased or decreased (zoom) to
             achieve desired proportions.

          o  Objects can be filled with a selected fill pattern.

          The text functions provide the following capabilities:

          o  Delete/undelete a character or line

          o  Cursor movement to top or bottom of text, to beginning or end
             of line.

          o  Insertion and replacement of characters

          When coloring (painting) slides, users can:

          o  Select an appropriate palette

          o  Assign colors to each object

          o  Change the background color of the slide

          Objects, including text, can be moved about the screen in
          coarse mode (50 pixels per keystroke), medium (10 pixels per
          keystroke), or fine (1 pixel per keystroke).

          Completed slides can be ``exported'' (the ReGIS commands to
          display the slide can be filed) from both interactive and non-
          interactive (VMS DCL) modes in color ReGIS, black and white
          ReGIS, or printer protocol formats.

          With the slide organizer, users can:

          o  Assemble DECslide ``exported'' slides, DECgraph ``outputted''
             graphs and single frame text files into slide trays. The
             trays are stored in presentation libraries.

          o  Do batch input - display slides from trays on a graphics
             terminal or print them on a graphics printer attached to the
             terminal.

          o  Modify presentations by reordering, copying, adding and
             deleting slides in a tray. The user can also copy and delete
             trays within the libraries.

          The slide organizer programmer's interface allows user-written
          applications to retrieve slides from trays within presentation
          libraries.

          Existing slides can be combined to form a new slide.

          Grid lines can be displayed for aligning objects on the screen.

          Various text-object character sizes are available. Each size is
          printable in double height/double width.

          A VMS printer queue can be set up with a supported graphics
          printer (See Optional Hardware) to output printer protocol
          files.

          Frequently used diagrams or text can be saved for use in a
          number of different slides.

          VAX DECslide is callable, permitting applications to include
          DECslide as part of a larger software system.
