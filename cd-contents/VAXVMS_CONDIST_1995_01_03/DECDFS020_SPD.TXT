 PRODUCT NAME:  DECdfs for OpenVMS Systems, Version 2.0 SPD 28.78.04

 DESCRIPTION

 DECdfs for OpenVMS Systems is a DECnet and DECnet/OSI layered prod-
 uct that provides OpenVMS users with the ability to use remote Open-
 VMS VAX and OpenVMS AXP disks as if they were directly attached to the
 local OpenVMS system.

 DECdfs software provides users and applications with transparent, high
 performance file access while using fewer CPU resources than standard
 DECnet and DECnet/OSI file access.

 Systems running DECdfs software can act as "servers" or "clients" or
 both. DECdfs servers make file resources available to systems running
 DECdfs client software. DECdfs clients are able to use file resources
 of systems running DECdfs server software. The file resources acces-
 sible through DECdfs can range in scope from a master file directory
 and all of its subordinate directories and files on a disk volume, to
 an individual file. The DECdfs server software assigns a unique name
 to the resource to be shared.

 In configurations where the DECdns (Distributed Name Service) is sup-
 ported, the DECdfs server registers the resource name with DECdns. In
 configurations where DECdns is not supported, the DECdfs client must
 include the resource location name when issuing the command to use the
 resource.

 DECdfs software uses DECdns on OpenVMS VAX configurations running DEC-
 net or DECnet/OSI, and on OpenVMS AXP configurations running DECnet
 /OSI. In order for DECdfs to use DECdns, there must be at least one
 DECdns server in the network. DECdns allows the name of the resource

 to be independent of its physical location on the network. DECdfs sys-
 tems throughout the network can continue accessing a resource even if
 the resource location is changed.

 DECdns is not available on OpenVMS AXP configurations running DECnet,
 but these configurations can use DECdfs by specifying the node name
 where the resource is located.

 The DECdfs client uses the resource by means of the DFS$CONTROL MOUNT
 command. This command specifies the DECdns name by which the resource
 was registered, enables communication between the client and the server,
 and creates a pseudo-device on the client system. The pseudo-device
 makes the remote resource appear to the client system as a local disk.
 Users can then perform operations on the pseudo-device, and DECdfs han-
 dles all of the network access and translation.

 Features

 The features of DECdfs V2.0 for OpenVMS software include:

 o  High performance access to remote disks

 o  Applications require no modifications to use remote disks, because
    the disks appear to be local

 o  Fewer CPU resources used than standard DECnet and DECnet/OSI file
    access

 o  Supports all OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS AXP file types

 o  Supports the following OpenVMS file operations:

    -  Shared access (read)

    -  Exclusive access (read & write)

    -  All OpenVMS directory operations, including the creation and dele-
       tion of directories

    -  Virtual I/O

    -  Mapped I/O

                                  2

 

 o  Transparent access to most of the standard OpenVMS DCL commands (those
    commands which neither manipulate identifiers nor use logical, phys-
    ical or write-shared I/O).

 o  Operates in any DECnet or DECnet/OSI environment. Both Local Area
    Networks and Wide Area Networks are supported.

 o  Uses DECdns, if present, to provide location-independent data ac-
    cess.

 o  File security provided through standard OpenVMS proxy mechanisms.
    The system manager on the server controls all file access.

 o  Optional end-to-end checksum provided to guard against network faults.

 o  The DECdfs Management utility allows the user to control DECdfs com-
    ponents and to display statistical and error information.

 Restrictions

 o  Files opened for write are opened exclusively

 o  Logical I/O is not supported

 o  Installed files are not supported

 o  The use of ACLs (Access Control Lists) on DECdfs client devices is
    not supported. ACLs on served files are not visible to a DECdfs client.

 product.

 DECdns software is bundled with DECnet/OSI. The DECdns client is en-
 abled with the DECnet/OSI End System or Extended Function license on
 OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS AXP systems. The DECdns server is enabled with
 the DECnet/OSI Extended Function license on OpenVMS VAX systems.

 Note that DECdns server software is not available for OpenVMS AXP sys-
 tems.

 ORDERING INFORMATION

 Licenses

 A license is required for each OpenVMS system on which the DECdfs V2.0
 for OpenVMS software is to be installed and executed. An OpenVMS sys-
 tem may be licensed to use the full functionality of DECdfs V2.0 or
 the client functionality only. Separate DECdfs V2.0 client and DECdfs
 V2.0 full functionality licenses are available. A full functionality
 license grants the right to use both the client capabilities and the
 server capabilities of DECdfs V2.0.

 The table below indicates the appropriate licenses for OpenVMS AXP and
 OpenVMS VAX systems using the DECdfs V2.0 server software or DECdfs
 V2.0 client software.
