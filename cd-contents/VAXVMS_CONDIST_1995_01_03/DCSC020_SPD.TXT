           PRODUCT NAME:  Digital Cartridge Server Component for OpenVMS, Version
           2.0                                                             SPD
           33.59.02

           DESCRIPTION

           The Digital Cartridge Server Component (DCSC) for OpenVMS provides the
           software front-end interface to the StorageTek 4400 Automated Cartridge
           System (StorageTek ACS) and Digital's Library Server DECLS. It can be
           installed on either a single OpenVMS system or a VMScluster.

           DCSC manages the library resources within an OpenVMS system. This in-
           cludes managing the allocation of ACS transports, locking and unlock-
           ing both cartridge and transport resources to accommodate user tape
           function requests, and recovering any unused resources (caused by a
           user mounting a tape and logging out before dismounting it).

           When a user requests a tape function such as mount, DCSC checks for
           the existence of the requested cartridge, selects an available trans-
           port, and locks the required resources. DCSC ensures the tape cartridge
           is physically loaded onto a StorageTek transport and, if requested,
           executes an OpenVMS tape mount function. Once a tape cartridge is mounted,
           DCSC makes it possible for users to request an OpenVMS copy or backup
           function to read data from or send data to the cartridge.

           DCSC provides a variety of example programs and an example tape man-
           agement system. These are provided for demonstration purposes. Dig-
           ital recommends that customers use tape management systems that are
           integrated with DCSC to insure data integrity (such as Digital's SLS
           layered product).

           The DCSC kit includes the following:

           o  DCSC Run-Time Library (RTL) routines-A set of tools that let pro-
              grammers design applications specific to their system and users.

           o  DCSC DCL Interface - lets users request tape cartridge functions
              (to request a mount of a specific tape cartridge, for example) from
              the OpenVMS DCL interface.

           o  Configuration File Editor - A menu-driven interface that lets sys-
              tem managers create the configuration file used to describe the trans-
              port and ACS environment to DCSC. DCSC reads this file when it starts
              up and uses it to determine operation, network, and transport re-
              source allocations.

           o  DCSC Server-A set of processes that manage user requests by allo-
              cating transport resources to users on an OpenVMS system. It also
              controls communications between the DCSC components and the Open-
              VMS/ULTRIX Connection software which, in turn, communicate with the
              StorageTek ACS (UCX is not required for installations using the DE-
              CLS software).

           The connection to the StorageTek transport for input and output op-
           erations is made through an HSC40/70/90 which is connected to one or
           more TC44-AA or TC44-BA controller boards. This connection creates the
           data path from which tape cartridge data is read or written to.

           Systems that utilize the XMI backplane can also use the KCM-44 to es-
           tablish a data path to the StorageTek transports.

           Configurations using DECLS use SCSI devices to connect to the trans-
           ports in the library.

           On a VMScluster consisting of several nodes, one node called the mas-
           ter server node fields requests from the other nodes on the VMSclus-
           ter, which are called virtual server nodes.

           The following documentation is available:

           o  Digital Cartridge Server Component Installation Guide -Explains how
              to install the DCSC using VMSINSTAL and provides a sample instal-
              lation log file.

           o  Digital Cartridge Server Component System Manager's Guide -Describes
              the DCSC, how it works with the robotic tape library, configura-
              tion tasks, how to use the Configuration File Editor system, and
              DCSC-specific system maintenance tasks.

           o  Digital Cartridge Server Component Programmer's Reference Guide -
              Describes the DCSC RTL routines and describes how to use them by
              providing examples of VAX C code fragments.

           o  Digital Cartridge Server Component User's Reference Guide -Summarizes
              the main functions of the DCSC, highlighting the functions performed
              by general users, such as mounting and dismounting tapes. In ad-
              dition, it describes how to use the DCSC cartridge DCL commands.
