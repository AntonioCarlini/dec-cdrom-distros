          PRODUCT NAME:  Storage Library System                  SPD 29.67.09
                         for OpenVMS Version 2.4A

          DESCRIPTION

          Data center managers face three storage management problems: system
          backup and restore complexity, effective file archiving and retrieval,
          and lack of online data storage capacity. The Storage Library System
          (SLS) for OpenVMS helps the storage administrator solve these prob-
          lems.

          SLS for OpenVMS manages tape volumes through the volume life cycle,
          automates backups, provides for system and user archiving, and makes
          it easy to find files stored on tapes. SLS for OpenVMS also provides
          a remote backup facility, and is therefore a major component in "lights
          out" data center operations.

          Key Features

          SLS for OpenVMS provides the following important file archiving and
          backup capabilities:

          o  Automatic, flexible scheduling of backup operations

          o  Centralized services for user-requested backup and archiving op-
             erations

          o  Support for remote backup and archiving operations directly between
             disks and tape drives located on different systems within a DEC-
             net network without staging data across disks

          o  Online maintenance of information about backed up and archived files
             and volumes; this allows quick retrieval of the files or restora-
             tion of disk volumes without the user having to know the names of
             the tape volumes on which the data was saved

                                        DIGITAL                      Nov 1994

             backed up or archived files to the same volume or volume set

          o  Direct positioning to the start of each save set file during a re-
             store operation using saved information about the tape position of
             each save set file

          o  DCL and menu interfaces with online help for users, operators, and
             storage administrators

          o  Customization features to meet a variety of operational and site
             requirements

          SLS for OpenVMS provides the following important media and device man-
          agement capabilities:

          o  Support for unattended backup operations using the TA90, TA90E, TA91,
             Tx8n7 automatic tape cartridge loaders, and the RV64 optical juke-
             box; optional support for the StorageTek[R] automated cartridge server

          o  Support for Tx8n7 automatic tape cartridge loaders as either di-
             rect slot robotic devices or as gravity loaders (stackers)

          o  Media life cycle control including maintenance of volume retention
             period, availability status, location, and scheduling of dates when
             volumes are to move offsite and return

          o  Maintenance of counters for each volume noting the number of times
             a volume has been mounted and the number of errors associated with
             the volume; these counters are used to schedule volume cleaning when
             the counters exceed threshold values

          o  Control of media allocation based on customer-defined media pools

          o  Ability to print external tape labels in a customizable format

          supported reel-to-reel and cartridge tape drives, the RV20 write-once
          optical disk drive, and the RV64 optical disk jukebox.

          SLS for OpenVMS Version 2.4A supports the following Digital linear tape
          (DLT) loaders as robotic devices on systems running OpenVMS VAX Ver-
          sion 5.5-2 through 6.1 or OpenVMS AXP Version 6.1:

          for OpenVMS Version 2.4A

          RDF software is distributed within the SLS for OpenVMS software. It
          is optionally installed during the SLS software installation proce-
          dure.

          RDF allows a tape or optical disk to be accessed from other OpenVMS
          nodes across the DECnet network for backups and archives. RDF consists
          of these components:

          o  RDF servers that execute tape I/O requests on behalf of a remote
             client; Servers are located on systems that have tape drives at-
             tached or that can access drives through the OpenVMS TMSCP Server

          o  RDF clients that provide the communications interface between ap-
             plications reading or writing data to a tape drive and the RDF servers

          SLS for OpenVMS software makes access to remote tape drives transpar-
          ent to SLS backup and archive operations by issuing RDF commands as
          appropriate if a designated tape drive is a remote one. SLS for Open-
          VMS software also manages volume load requests to remote systems to
          allow unattended backups or to communicate with a console operator.
          SLS for OpenVMS makes no direct use of the remote disk capabilities
          inherent in RDF.

          OPTIONS

          To support a variety of configuration requirements, six SLS for Open
          VMS license options are available:

          Storage Library System                                SPD 29.67.09
          for OpenVMS Version 2.4A

          SLS for OpenVMS software provides full functionality, as described above,
          to users on the node or VMScluster on which SLS is executing. A node
          or VMScluster executing SLS for OpenVMS software provides media man-
          agement services for itself and for any "client nodes" connected to
          it. At least one SLS for OpenVMS license in the network is required
          for use of the SLS for OpenVMS product.

          SLS for OpenVMS software manages the following:

          o  The "SLS for OpenVMS media database," an RMS file which describes
             all removable storage media known to SLS for OpenVMS software.

          o  "SLS for OpenVMS history files" in which information about user files
             backed up or archived under SLS for OpenVMS control at the local
             node is recorded.

          o  The "SLS for OpenVMS magazine database," an RMS file which describes
             all Tx8n7 magazines and the cartridges contained in them.

          SLS for OpenVMS VAX REMOTE and SLS for OpenVMS AXP REMOTE

          SLS for OpenVMS REMOTE software provides backup scheduling and archiv-
          ing services for the node or VMScluster on which it is executing, and
          acts as a client of another node executing SLS for OpenVMS software
          when it requires media management services.

          A node or VMScluster executing SLS for OpenVMS REMOTE software in com-
          munication with another node or VMScluster executing SLS for OpenVMS
          software provides users with the full functionality described above.

          Like SLS for OpenVMS software, SLS for OpenVMS REMOTE software main-
          tains "SLS for OpenVMS history files" in which it records information
          about user files backed up or archived locally under its control. The
          node executing SLS for OpenVMS REMOTE software communicates using DEC-
          net software to a "server node" running SLS software. The "server node"
          maintains the SLS for OpenVMS media database. The SLS for OpenVMS me-
          dia database contains information about volume location and pool ac-
          cess authorization.

          for OpenVMS Version 2.4A

          Each SLS for OpenVMS REMOTE node must be connected to a server node
          executing SLS software for media management services. Any number of
          SLS for OpenVMS REMOTE nodes may be connected to a single SLS for Open-
          VMS node.

          SLS for OpenVMS VAX ACS and SLS for OpenVMS AXP ACS

          SLS for OpenVMS ACS supports the StorageTek 4400 automated cartridge
          server. This license is required in order to interface the StorageTek
          ACS to SLS for OpenVMS.

          The SLS ACS license is loaded in the system together with either the
          SLS or SLS REMOTE licenses.

          Disk space required by the SLS for OpenVMS media database and history
          files:

          The SLS for OpenVMS media database is present only on nodes execut-
          ing SLS for OpenVMS software (i.e., not on nodes executing SLS for Open-
          VMS REMOTE software). The disk space required by the SLS for OpenVMS
          media database depends on the number of pieces of media to be managed.
          During installation, the storage administrator may designate the disk
          on which the SLS for OpenVMS media database is to be kept. For enhanced
          data safety, the SLS for OpenVMS media database may be stored on a shad-
          owed disk.

          SLS for OpenVMS history files are present on any node executing ei-
          ther SLS for OpenVMS software or SLS for OpenVMS REMOTE software. The
          disk space required by a SLS history file depends on the number of files
          to be tracked by SLS for OpenVMS software. During installation, the
          storage administrator may designate the disk on which SLS for Open-
          VMS history files are to be kept. For enhanced data safety, the SLS
          for OpenVMS history files may be stored on a shadowed disk.

          Total Disk Space Requirement for SLS for OpenVMS Software:

          Execution of SLS for OpenVMS software requires approximately 8,400 blocks
          (the number of blocks occupied by SLS for OpenVMS and RDF software)
          plus one block for every piece of media it manages plus one block for
          every six files it tracks.

          Example: Assume that there are 1,500 pieces of media under management
          by SLS for OpenVMS software and that 60,000 files are tracked. The space
          required is:

          History         10,000 blocks
          files:

          TOTAL           19,900 blocks (10.0 MB)

          Total Disk Space Requirement for SLS for OpenVMS REMOTE software:

          Execution of SLS for OpenVMS REMOTE software requires 7,900 blocks (the
          number of blocks occupied by SLS for OpenVMS REMOTE and RDF software)
          plus one block for every six files it tracks.

          Example: Assume that there are 60,000 files known to SLS for OpenVMS
          REMOTE software. The disk space required is:

          SLS for         7,900 blocks
          OpenVMS
          REMOTE
          software:

          History         10,000 blocks
          files:

          TOTAL           17,900 blocks (8.0 MB)

          In addition to the disk space specified above, adequate disk storage
          must be available on the host system to accommodate history files if
          that option is selected.

          These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
          sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
          system environment, configuration, and software options.
