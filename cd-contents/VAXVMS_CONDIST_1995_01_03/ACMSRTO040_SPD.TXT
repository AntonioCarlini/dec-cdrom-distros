 PRODUCT NAME:  ACMS Version 4.0 for OpenVMS            SPD 25.50.13
                (Application Control and Management Sys-
                tem)

 DESCRIPTION

 ACMS is a transaction processing (TP) monitor designed for the Open-
 VMS operating systems. ACMS works with other Digital Equipment Cor-
 poration commercial application software products to provide users with
 a complete and customizable development and run-time environment for
 transaction processing applications such as order tracking, account-
 ing and billing, banking, shop floor control, and insurance claims pro-
 cessing.

 ACMS software helps users through the entire application development
 life cycle, including the installation, planning, design, development,
 testing, implementation, management, and maintenance of complex TP ap-
 plications. ACMS provides a special-purpose application definition lan-
 guage for the structured definition of TP application functions and
 run-time characteristics.

 ACMS makes efficient use of the OpenVMS operating systems and asso-
 ciated hardware resources, making ACMS particularly suited to mission-
 critical applications that require high throughput and performance.

 ACMS integrates with the following Digital layered products:

 o  DECforms or VAX TDMS for forms management

    -  If you plan to use TDMS or DECforms, a VAX system is required.

 o  CDD/Repository for VMS for the creation, analysis, and administra-
    tion of metadata

                               DIGITAL                      May 1994

                                                         AE-Y995N-TE

 

 o  DEC Rdb for OpenVMS, DEC DBMS for OpenVMS, and OpenVMS RMS for data
    management

 o  DECtrace for OpenVMS for performance event data collection

 o  ACMS Desktop for multivendor client access to ACMS applications

 o  All OpenVMS languages and tools for application development (eg.
    DEC C, VAX COBOL, DEC COBOL, DEC Fortran, DEC Pascal, and Basic)

 Because ACMS is designed to allow for modular implementation as well
 as development, users can separate and distribute front-end process-
 ing (data input/output operations such as forms processing) from back-
 end processing (data calculations and database storage). In addition,
 ACMS allows users the use of nonstandard terminal or I/O devices (such
 as bar-code readers and ATMs).

 Application Development Environment

                                  2

 

 ACMS uses a high-level, English-like definition language that replaces
 system service calls for most TP application functions. Using the ACMS
 Application Definition Utility, a programmer can:

 o  Structure all application work into three basic steps:

    -  Exchange steps for terminal I/O processing

    -  Processing steps for database access and general computation

    -  Block steps for performing work common to several processing and
       exchange steps

 o  Control task execution and flow using conditional statements such
    as IF THEN ... ELSE, WHILE DO, SELECT FIRST, and CONTROL FIELD syn-
    tax in conjunction with Boolean expressions

 o  Define and implement subroutine transactions using the CALL TASK
    syntax

 o  Create menus and hierarchies of menus

 o  Define resources used to execute transactions, such as servers, workspaces,
    and audit trails

 o  Start and end database recovery units

 ACMS also includes the ACMS Task Debugger to debug ACMS definitions
 and servers.

 Run-Time System

 ACMS includes a complete run-time system for implementing application
 definitions. The ACMS Run-Time System is made up of eight specialized
 processes. Four manage the processing of a transaction, and four mon-
 itor and control the run-time system.

 The following ACMS processes manage the work within ACMS transactions:

 o  Command Process (CP) - Manages logins and interaction between ter-
    minals and ACMS. CPs can be multithreaded (one CP process can han-
    dle menus and forms I/O for many ACMS terminals simultaneously).
    The CP passes input data to the Application Execution Controller
    (EXC) for processing by a server.

                                  3

 

 o  Application Execution Controller (EXC) - Controls task execution
    for all the tasks in an application. Each application has its own
    EXC process, which starts up and controls the server processes needed
    to handle processing work for tasks.

 o  Server Process (SP) - Carries out the high-level programming lan-
    guage routines or DCL routines that handle a task's processing work
    and database or file I/O. Programmers link their routines to the
    ACMS-supplied main program to create customized servers for database
    access, computation, and other functions.

 o  Queued Task Initiator (QTI) - Removes task elements from a task queue
    and initiates their execution in a specified application. Queued
    tasks are tasks placed in a queue for later execution. Queued tasks
    cannot collect terminal input data, but otherwise are the same as
    any other ACMS task.

 The ACMS processes that monitor and control the run-time system are:

 o  ACMS Application Central Controller (ACC) - Acts as the central con-
    trol point for ACMS run-time systems. The ACC starts and controls
    the Terminal Subsystem Controller, the QTI, the EXC, and the au-
    dit trail log. The ACC process must be started and running on each
    computer system where ACMS applications are used.

 o  Audit Trail Logger (ATL) - Writes information about a running ACMS
    system to the audit trail log file. The ATL keeps a record of when
    the ACMS system starts and stops, when users log in, and when ap-
    plications and tasks start and stop.

 o  Terminal Subsystem Controller (TSC) - Creates and controls the num-
    ber of active Command Processes (CPs) and assigns terminals to CPs.
    The TSC starts and stops CPs as needed, and controls which termi-
    nals can access ACMS.

 o  Software Event Logger (SWL) - Records all ACMS internal software
    errors and event messages that occur during the execution of ACMS
    application programs.


                                  4

 

 Communication among these run-time processes can occur on a single com-
 puter system or between more than one computer in a VMScluster sys-
 tem or DECnet network. For example, a Command Process (CP) on one com-
 puter system can initiate a task within an application on another com-
 puter system.

 Application Management and Control

 Once an application is developed, the user moves that application into
 a production (real-use) environment. ACMS provides support for ACMS
 applications used in a production environment.

 ACMS includes seven utilities for defining, monitoring and modifying
 application management characteristics:

 o  ACMSGEN - Modifies and displays ACMS system parameters.

 o  Application Authorization Utility (AAU) - Authorizes applications
    to be installed.

 o  User Definition Utility (UDU) - Authorizes users to log in to ACMS
    and assigns login displays, including default menus, to ACMS users.

 o  Device Definition Utility (DDU) - Authorizes ACMS terminals and,
    optionally, defines captive terminals to log in directly to ACMS.

 o  Queue Manager (QUEMGR) - Creates and manages ACMS task queues and
    queued task elements.

 o  Software Event Log Utility Program (SWLUP) - Creates reports of se-
    lected events recorded by the Software Event Logger.

 o  Audit Trail Report Utility (ATR) - Returns records of application
    and user activity.

 In addition to the utilities, ACMS also provides users with the fol-
 lowing additional support for application management and control:

 o  ACMS operator commands - Performs standard operator functions such
    as starting and stopping the ACMS system, the TSC (Terminal Sub-
    system Controller) process, the QTI process, and ACMS applications.

                                  5

 

 o  Command Procedures - Evaluates and modifies the values of OpenVMS
    and ACMS system parameters, and ACMS run-time process quotas.

 Front-End/Back-End Processing (Client/Server Processing)

 In ACMS, terminal, menu, and other I/O functions are separated from
 database or file processing and computational functions. The termi-
 nal and menu functions are handled on the front end of the transac-
 tion processing system, while task flow control, data processing, and
 computations are performed on the back end of the system.

 The separation of functions in ACMS (called the client/server model)
 can be implemented on a single node or on multiple nodes in a DECnet
 network. Because the ACMS client/server model always provides sepa-
 rate front and back ends, users can at any time off-load the front end
 to another computer system without reprogramming the application code.

 The ACMS Systems Interface (SI) lets users write front-end programs,
 or agents, to support specialized devices such as bar-code readers and
 automatic teller machines.

 ACMS includes support for failover in a distributed environment. If
 one OpenVMS node is not available to process a transaction, ACMS can
 automatically route the transaction to another application running on
 an available node.

 Presentation Services

 Users select and run ACMS tasks from menus. To create menus, ACMS sup-
 ports DECforms as its primary presentation service (on VAX only). In
 addition, ACMS provides support for VAX TDMS (on VAX only) and other
 presentation service products.

 *  If you plan to use TDMS or DECforms, a VAX system is required. See
    the ACMS Writing and Migrating Applications for OpenVMS AXP for more
    information on these restrictions.




                                  6

 

 ACMS also provides support for other presentation service products through
 the ACMS Request Interface and Systems Interface. The Request Inter-
 face lets users use presentation services other than DECforms or TDMS
 for I/O functions limited to one user per process. The Systems Inter-
 face lets users use presentation services for single-user or multiple-
 user I/O functions.

 Database Management

 ACMS includes support in its definition language for starting and end-
 ing database transactions/recovery units through a database manage-
 ment system. Database products supported include DEC Rdb for OpenVMS
 (including SQL), RMS, and DEC DBMS.

 Using the DECdtm component of the OpenVMS operating system, ACMS lets
 users coordinate operations on multiple recoverable resources (such
 as databases and files) within a single atomic transaction. Users can
 perform operations on multiple databases through a single transaction
 and ensure atomicity (that is, if the transaction fails, any changes
 made to databases, files, or ACMS queues are rolled back to their pre-
 vious state before the transaction started). Please note that RMS Jour-
 naling for OpenVMS is required to support recoverable ACMS queue op-
 erations coordinated using DECdtm. RMS Journaling for OpenVMS is a sep-
 arate layered product, distinct from RMS, supplied with OpenVMS.

 ACMS applications can also access other data management products or
 file management systems that support the OpenVMS VAX or OpenVMS AXP
 calling standard.

 Data Dictionary

 ACMS supports the CDD/Repository data dictionary. ACMS stores appli-
 cation definitions in CDD/Repository directories and uses CDD/Repository
 record definitions for its workspaces.

 Resource Utilization Collection and Reporting




                                  7

 

 ACMS supports DECtrace for OpenVMS to allow the collection and report-
 ing of event-based data gathered from any combination of OpenVMS lay-
 ered products and ACMS applications. For each predefined event in ACMS,
 DECtrace for OpenVMS can collect information about resource utiliza-
 tion such as CPU time or ACMS data items such as the task name. Us-
 ing the DECtrace for OpenVMS cross-facility feature, you can relate
 ACMS events with events from multiple layered products. Task Queuing

 Some ACMS applications require that the data be collected and stored
 in a temporary storage area (queue) for the application to process at
 another time. The ACMS queuing facility lets users create and manage
 ACMS task queues. ACMS queue services are used to place/remove tasks
 on/off ACMS task queues.

 Security

 ACMS ensures that the user's data remains secure by giving the sys-
 tem manager control over which users have access to ACMS. Using Open-
 VMS and ACMS authorization facilities system managers can:

 o  Authorize users to use ACMS

 o  Control terminals connecting to ACMS

 o  Limit the applications a user can run

 o  Prevent unauthorized access to the operating system while running
    ACMS tasks

 ACMS includes transaction security in the form of access control lists
 (ACLs) in the definition language. Whenever a user selects a trans-
 action, that user's OpenVMS identifier is checked against the ACL de-
 fined for that transaction to determine if that user is allowed to ex-
 ecute that transaction.

 VMScluster Environment/Availability

 In a VMScluster environment, ACMS applications support highly avail-
 able configurations that help avoid single points of system failure.

                                  8

 

 ACMS includes support for failover in a VMScluster environment. If one
 VMScluster processor is not available to process a transaction, ACMS
 can automatically route the transaction to another application run-
 ning on an available processor that shares the same data.

 ACMS can improve the performance of a database management system in
 a VMScluster environment by allowing the use of the client/server model
 to run database servers on a single processor.

 ACMS Run-Time Option

 The ACMS Run-Time Option is a subset of ACMS, which lets users run ex-
 isting ACMS applications or programs and change application attributes
 (for example, menu definitions). The purpose of the Run-Time Option
 is to support the execution of applications developed on a host ma-
 chine using the development version of this product, and to run on pro-
 duction machines.

 ACMS Remote Access Option

 The ACMS Remote Access Option is a subset of the Run-Time Option and
 provides the ability to place users and the terminal I/O associated
 with them on a separate OpenVMS system, off loaded from the applica-
 tion system or VMScluster.

 SOFTWARE LICENSING

 This software is furnished under the licensing provisions of Digital
 Equipment Corporation's Standard Terms and Conditions. For more in-
 formation about Digital's licensing terms and policies, contact your
 local Digital office.

 LICENSE MANAGEMENT FACILITY SUPPORT

 This layered product supports the OpenVMS License Management Facil-
 ity.

 License units for this product are allocated on an Unlimited and Con-
 current Use basis. Concurrent Use licensing enables a prespecified num-
 ber of users to use the product. Using this method of licensing, the
 price of the product depends on the number of licenses purchased for
 each node.

 With Concurrent Use licenses, the OpenVMS License Management Facil-
 ity checks to make sure that the number of simultaneous sign-ons does
 not exceed the number of Concurrent Use licenses purchased, where it
 is assumed that there is one license allocated for each simultaneous
 sign-on desired. LMF calculates this by assigning 100 license units
 to each license. It then computes the total number of license units
 purchased (100 times the number of licenses purchased) and subtracts
 100 for each simultaneous sign-on that occurs, until it reaches zero.
 At zero, LMF determines that no other users may sign on until license
 units are freed up.

 For more information on the License Management Facility, refer to the
 appropriate OpenVMS Operating System Software Product Description (VAX:
 SPD 25.01.xx or AXP: 41.87.xx) or the License Management Facility man-
 ual of the appropriate OpenVMS Operating System documentation set.

 For more information about Digital's licensing terms and policies, con-
 tact your local Digital office.
