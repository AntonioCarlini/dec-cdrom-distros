PRODUCT NAME:   POSIX for OpenVMS                      SPD 34.82.04
                Version 2.0

DESCRIPTION

POSIX for OpenVMS Version 2.0 brings support for the POSIX (Portable
Operating System Interface for Computing Environments) Industry Stan-
dards and for the X/Open[TM] BASE Profile specifications as defined
in the X/Open Portability Guide Issue 4, to OpenVMS on the VAX[TM] and
AXP platforms.

POSIX and XPG4 define a set of interface standards for various parts
of an operating system. Both provide a comprehensive set of standards,
draft standards, and specifications that support interoperability and
portability of applications at the source code level. Because of the
consistency they afford to applications at the operating system level,
the POSIX standards and XPG4 specifications are essential underpin-
nings of open computing environments. In fact, POSIX for OpenVMS Version 2.0
provides the capability on OpenVMS to develop and run applications con-
forming to the POSIX and the XPG4 standards.

The POSIX[R] standards development effort is sponsored by the Insti-
tute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE). As individual POSIX
standards are approved, organizations such as the International Or-
ganization for Standardization (ISO) are also embracing them. XPG4 has

been developed by X/Open, which is an independent consortium of com-
puter systems manufacturers; XPG4 specifies a comprehensive applica-
tions interface that includes POSIX 1003.1-1988 (as upgraded by POSIX
1003.1-1990) and POSIX 1003.2-1992 as well as an additional set of de
facto and formal standards.

POSIX for OpenVMS Version 2.0 includes support for the standards and
draft standards for the POSIX system application programming inter-
face (POSIX 1003.1, 1988 and 1990), POSIX shell and utilities (POSIX
1003.2, which includes the User Portability Extension, formerly POSIX
P1003.2a), and real time programming (1003.1b, formerly POSIX P1003.4).
POSIX for OpenVMS Version 2.0 also supports the XPG4 BASE Profile spec-
ifications, internationalized system calls and functions, commands and
utilities, with the C language. (For a listing of the specific stan-
dards supported by POSIX for OpenVMS Version 2.0, refer to Section 6.

User Environments

o  Program Development Environment

The program development environment for POSIX for OpenVMS Version 2.0
allows the use of tools from both the OpenVMS development environment
and the POSIX for OpenVMS Version 2.0 environment. Program develop-
ers who choose to work at DCL level can use the OpenVMS program de-
velopment environment tools, including the supported C compilers, the
OpenVMS Linker, and OpenVMS Debugger, as well as application build-
ing tools included in VAXset. Program developers who choose to work
at the POSIX for OpenVMS Version 2.0 shell level can use the POSIX en-
vironment defined in POSIX 1003.2, including the vi text editor, c89
(for linking and compiling programs), make (for building applications),
ar (for archiving object modules). Also supplied are the lex lexical
analyzer and the yacc compiler compiler.

o  Interactive User Environment






                                 2

 

The interactive user environment for POSIX for OpenVMS Version 2.0 pro-
vides the user with a set of UNIX[TM]-like commands and utilities that
include functions similar to DCL, in addition to functions unavail-
able in the DCL environment. For example the POSIX for OpenVMS Version 2.0
shell supports "pipes" which allow the output of one command to be-
come the input of a subsequent command.

Assistance on how to use the POSIX for OpenVMS Version 2.0 features
are available both via standard OpenVMS Online Help and a POSIX-conformant
man command. The man command supplies reference information on all of
the supported utilities, callable functions, datatypes and data struc-
tures using the typical user interface familiar to UNIX users.

o  End User Environment (Running POSIX and XPG4 Programs)

POSIX for OpenVMS Version 2.0 programs are run from either the Open-
VMS DCL level or the POSIX for OpenVMS Version 2.0 shell level. A cap-
tive account can also be created, in which a user who accesses the sys-
tem is limited to running one or more POSIX or XPG4 applications.

POSIX Standards

This section gives more detail on the POSIX standards implementated
by POSIX for OpenVMS Version 2.0.

o  POSIX 1003.1

POSIX 1003.1 is an approved standard, adopted by the IEEE and endorsed
by X/Open, ANSI, and ISO. It was first approved in 1988 as IEEE Std
1003.1-1988. In 1990 the standard was revised to IEEE Std 1003.1-1990
and also became the international standard ISO/IEC 9945-1.

POSIX 1003.1 is the standard most commonly supported by open system
vendors today. It defines a standard for the basic system services to
be provided by an operating system. These are the services which will
allow an application to perform operations such as process creation
and execution, file system access, and I/O device management.

o  POSIX P1003.1a

The draft standard IEEE P1003.1a covers extensions to IEEE 1003.1 and
has not yet been incorporated into the final standard. POSIX for Open-
VMS Version 2.0 currently implements draft 4.

o  POSIX 1003.1b

POSIX 1003.1b is an approved standard, adopted by the IEEE in 1993.
It was formerly the POSIX P1003.4 draft standard. It addresses require-
ments for real-time computing and support for such functions as mem-
ory management, semaphores, message queues, scheduling, real-time files
and signals, asynchronous I/O operations and timers.

o  POSIX 1003.2

POSIX 1003.2 is an approved standard, adopted by the IEEE in 1992, and
endorsed by X/Open, ANSI, and ISO. It includes the User Portability
Extension (UPE) functionality formerly defined in the POSIX P1003.2a
draft standard. It provides an interactive interface to shell and util-
ity services, and a series callable functions for regular expression
handling.

The 1003.2-based interactive interface to POSIX for OpenVMS Version 2.0
is a set of UNIX-like commands and utilities. The POSIX for OpenVMS
Version 2.0 command language interpreter (shell) has many of the func-
tions and features of the Korn Shell. The POSIX for OpenVMS Version 2.0
interactive interface also includes a group of complex utilities (such
as awk, lex, make and yacc), a series of C-language programming de-
velopment utilities, and a text editor, vi.

XPG4 BASE Profile Specifications

This section gives more detail on Issue 4 of the X/Open Portability
Guide specifications implementated by POSIX for OpenVMS Version 2.0.

o  XPG4 System Interfaces and Headers



                                 4

 

The XPG4 specifications include all the POSIX 1003.1 system calls and
functions together with extensions. POSIX for OpenVMS Version 2.0 im-
plements all the mandatory functions defined in this specification as
well as the functionality indicated as "extension" and "FIPS".

o  XPG4 Commands and Utilities

With the XPG4 specifications, a number of new commands and utilities
are required in addition to those defined with POSIX 1003.2. POSIX for
OpenVMS Version 2.0 implements the mandatory comands and utilities de-
fined in this specification as well as the functionality indicated as
"extension" and "FIPS".

o  XPG4 Internationalisation Features

The internationalisation features provided within XPG4 allow for the
run-time environment of a program to be set up to provide the correct
processing/presentation of local language text and cultural data; no
recompiling or relinking is required. Program messages may be stored
separate from the logic of a program and translated into several lan-
guages using the Message Catalogue system. The cultural environment
of a program is obtained by associating it with a specific set of lo-
calisation data, called a "locale". POSIX for OpenVMS Version 2.0 con-
tains the locale for American English; users can build their own lo-
cales for other languages. Examples of other locales are provided.

The specification provides support for the ISO 8859-1:1987 8 bit char-
acter set which covers the major European languages.

XPG4 multibyte character internationalisation for the shell and util-
ities is supported.

C Language Extensions

Conformance to the POSIX standards and XPG4 specifications has meant
changes and additional functionality for the C run-time library pro-
vided with the C compiler.



                                 5

 

Two sets of shareable images are supplied with POSIX for OpenVMS Version 2.0;
one to support the current range of functionality, and a second to pre-
serve backward compatibility with programs compiled and linked under
a previous version of POSIX for OpenVMS.

The stdio library funtions support the behaviour required by POSIX 1003.1.
The C run-time library supports the ISO C features required by POSIX
1003.1.

POSIX for OpenVMS Version 2.0 includes support for internationalized
regular expression match and compile functions, native language mes-
sage handling functions, and native language versions of the error han-
dling functions.

POSIX for OpenVMS Version 2.0 also adds table creation/search/deletion
functions for linear tables, hash tables, and tree structured tables,
as well as mathematical functions. Further additions and changes have
been necessary to incorporate the TCP/IP Sockets calls and interop-
erability with DECthreads.

POSIX for OpenVMS Version 2.0 supports all the floating point features
introduced by OpenVMS Version 6.1.

All the above enhancements are part of the POSIX C RTL which is in-
voked by the c89 preprocessor provided as part of POSIX for OpenVMS
Version 2.0.

Supported Standards and Components - a Summary

The following list summarizes the formal and draft POSIX standards and
components of the XPG4 BASE Profile specification implemented by POSIX
for OpenVMS Version 2.0:

o  POSIX IEEE Std. 1003.1-1988

o  POSIX IEEE Std. 1003.1-1990 ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990

o  a part of POSIX IEEE 1003.1a, draft 4

o  POSIX IEEE Std. 1003.1b-1993

o  POSIX IEEE Std. 1003.2-1992

                                 6

 

o  All system interfaces not defined as "optional" that are contained
   in the first two volumes of the XPG4.

o  The curses Interface Library defined in Volume 3 of Issue 3 of the
   X/Open Portability Guide.

POSIX and XPG4 Conformance and Certification

o  POSIX Conformace

The POSIX standards require that suppliers who claim conformance pro-
vide a conformance document that describes how the supplier implements
the standard. This is the only proof of conformance required by the
IEEE.

In the United States, the National Institute of Standards and Tech-
nology (NIST) has developed the POSIX Conformance Test Suite or PCTS.
The PCTS tests for conformance to NIST's Federal Information Process-
ing Standard (FIPS 151-2), which is based on POSIX 1003.1-1990. All
versions of OpenVMS from V5.5 onwards are FIPS 151 certifiable; the
V6.1 release of the OpenVMS operating system on both VAX and AXP plat-
forms will achieve FIPS 151-2 certification.

o  XPG4 Base Profile Branding

Software vendors whose products implement XPG4 BASE Profile specifi-
cations can apply to X/Open for the right to display the X/Open BASE
Profile brand. The X/Open BASE Profile brand identifies that a sys-
tem fulfills the comprehensive and stringent set of X/Open require-
ments by:

   -  Implementing the minimum set of components required to create
      the XPG4 Common Applications Environment. This set of XPG4 BASE
      Profile components consists of the internationalized system calls
      and functions, commands and utilities, and the C language as im-
      plemented on a specific hardware platform.




                                 7

 

   -  Passing those portions of the Verification Suite for X/Open (VSX)
      that test the implementation of these XPG4 BASE Profile compo-
      nents. Components must pass a series of more than 10000 tests
      in VSX to earn the X/Open BASE Profile Brand.

OpenVMS VAX V5.5 and V6.0 are XPG3 BASE branded (as of June 1992). The
V6.1 release of the OpenVMS operating system on both VAX and AXP plat-
forms will achieve XPG4 BASE Profile Branding.

Interoperability with OpenVMS Components and other Layered
Products

POSIX for OpenVMS Version 2.0 contains a number of enhancements which
provide for interoperability with components of OpenVMS and with Key
Layered products.

o  DECWindows Motif

POSIX for OpenVMS Version 2.0 applications can take advantage of the
DECwindows/Motif functions. DECwindows/Motif V1.2 is required.

o  DEC TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS

The network APIs provided by DEC TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS are ac-
cessible by POSIX for OpenVMS Version 2.0 applications via a sockets
interface. These interfaces provide support for sockets in the Inter-
net domain and are based on the BSD Sockets definition. The Sockets
Library is included as part of the POSIX for OpenVMS C RTL.

o  DECthreads

DECthreads as defined by IEEE P1003.4a draft 4 are provided with Open-
VMS. Use of OpenVMS DECthreads by POSIX for OpenVMS Version 2.0 is sup-
ported together with some additional Threads features as defined by
the more up-to-date IEEE P1003.4a draft 6.
