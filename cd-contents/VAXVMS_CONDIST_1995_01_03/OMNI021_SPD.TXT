 PRODUCT NAME:  DEComni for OpenVMS VAX, Version 2.1    SPD 32.32.03

 DESCRIPTION

 DEComni is a network communication product that provides an Applica-
 tion Programming Interface (API) for connection and management of man-
 ufacturing/utility control devices and systems. DEComni implements the
 Manufacturing Message Specification (MMS), ISO/IEC 9506-1 and ISO/IEC
 9506-2. When combined with prerequisite hardware and software, DEComni
 interoperates with other systems supporting the Manufacturing Message
 Specification ISO/IEC9506-1 and ISO/IEC 9506-2 specifications.

 The DEComni API is also used by DECosap for OpenVMS and provides for
 both open (OSI/MMS) and proprietary device connections. For more in-
 formation about DECosap, please see that product's Software Product
 Description (SPD 32.75.xx).

 Features

 DEComni is an implementation of the Manufacturing Message Specifica-
 tion (MMS), ISO/IEC 9506, consisting of a callable interface on Open-
 VMS that takes the proper arguments and transforms them into the proper
 MMS protocol.

 DEComni provides, as a minimal set, the Client Conformance require-
 ments for the services specified in MAP Implementation Class MAP3.

 The product may interoperate with those device vendors that have im-
 plemented to ISO/IEC 9506 (MMS).

 DEComni provides a high level applications programming interface (API)
 with a high degree of functionality built in. The interface is easy
 to use and requires very little support code.

 Components

 Omni API

 Omni API contains a callable run-time library that is an implementa-
 tion of MMS. The actual support for services is listed in the Proto-
 col Implementation Conformance Statement (PICS) found in Appendix A:
 Conformance to Standards. Service classes supported are in the fol-
 lowing categories: Environment, VMD Support, Domains, Program Invo-
 cations, and Variables.

 Object Definition Facility (ODF)

 ODF is used to define the objects and attribute values that are ex-
 pected to be found at a remote Virtual Manufacturing Device (VMD). This
 facility is also used to define aspects of a local VMD if supported
 by the application.

 ODF is used to define the mapping of MMS variable types to and from
 OpenVMS data type definitions.

 OmniView

 OmniView is a demonstration application written using the callable in-
 terface that operates in a DECwindows Motif[R] environment. It pro-
 vides a limited user interface to the following MMS client services
 from a VAXstation running the prerequisite software:

 o  Initiate

 o  Conclude

 o  Status

 o  Abort

 o  GetNameList

 o  Identify

 o  GetCapabilityList

 o  Read

                                  2

 

 o  Write

 o  Start

 o  Stop

 o  Reset

 o  GetVariableAccessAttributes

 o  GetDomainAttributes

 o  GetProgramInvocationAttributes



























                                  3

 

 DEComni Installation Verification Procedure (IVP)

 The DEComni IVP performs a series of tests to verify proper instal-
 lation.

 CONFORMANCE TO STANDARDS

 The conformance of DEComni software to OSI standards is specified in
 Appendix A of this SPD.
 INSTALLATION

 Only experienced customers should install DEComni for OpenVMS soft-
 ware. Digital recommends that all other customers purchase Digital's
 Installation Services. These services provide for installation of the
 software product by an experienced Digital Software Specialist.
 Installation for DEComni consists of the following:

 o  Verification that all components of DEComni have been received

 o  Verification that the necessary versions of the prerequisite soft-
    ware and documentation are available

 o  Verification of the appropriate system parameters

 o  Verification that the system meets the minimum hardware and soft-
    ware requirements as specified this SPD

 o  Customer making available for a reasonable period of time, as mu-
    tually agreed upon by Digital and the customer, all hardware com-
    munication facilities and terminals that are to be used during in-
    stallation

 o  Installation of the DEComni software by creating the necessary di-
    rectories and by copying the software from the distribution media

 o  Verification that DEComni has been installed correctly by using the
    IVP

 Note: Should a customer attempt the installation and require the ser-
 vices of a software specialist to modify the previously installed op-
 erating system parameters, or aid in the installation, a time and ma-
 terials charge will apply.

                                  4

 

 Connectivity to all other nodes within the network is the responsi-
 bility of the customer.

 of 32 bits is supported.

 Note 2

 The effective length for strings is limited by the maximum PDU size.
 See Note 8.

 Note 3

                                 19

 

 Date and Time are supported. Support for Time Sequence Identifier is
 N/A.

 Note 4

 Read and Write indications are delivered to user written code and thus
 uninterruptible access is application dependent.

 Note 5

 The syntax and semantics for file name are specified by the OpenVMS
 Operating System. This is documented in the VMS documentation under
 "Full File Specification." Wildcard specifiers are not permitted.

 The file name must be specified in the first graphic string of the File-
 Name production. Any information in additional graphic strings will
 be ignored.

 Note 6

 The range is 1-infinity. Acceptance of indications is under program-
 ming control. The actual number of outstanding requests allowable is
 dependent upon process memory limits which is set by either the pro-
 grammer or system manager.

 Note 7

 This implementation does not specify additional code nor additional
 detail in error type.

 Note 8

 The following semantics are defined for the use of the local detail
 calling/called fields. As a result, a limit is set for a maximum MMS
 PDU size, which limits specific functions.

 The semantics of this field are contained in the implementation agree-
 ments of the NIST (National Institute for Standards and Technology -
 OSE Implementor's Workshop) Special Publication 500-206 titled Sta-
 ble Implementation Agreements for Open Systems Interconnection Pro-
 tocols, Version 6, Edition 1, December 1992, Part 20 (MMS) Sections
 8.2.0.3 and 8.2.0.4.
