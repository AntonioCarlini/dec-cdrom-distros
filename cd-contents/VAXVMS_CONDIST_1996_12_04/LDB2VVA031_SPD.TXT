   PRODUCT NAME:  DEC DB Integrator Gateway               SPD 25.E7.08
                  for DB2[TM], Version 3.1A

   DESCRIPTION

   DEC DB Integrator Gateway for DB2 (DB2 Gateway) provides applications
   and tools with direct, read/write access to DB2 databases residing on
   IBM[R] MVS/XA and MVS/ESA systems. This access can be via interactive
   or dynamic SQL interfaces. The DB2 Gateway communicates with the DB
   Integrator Gateway for DB2 Server which must be installed on the IBM
   system.

   Support for client/server access is provided by the SQL/Services server
   and Microsoft[R] Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) drivers for Microsoft
   Windows[TM] and Windows NT[TM] applications. Optional support for em-
   bedded SQL and SQL module language programming is available.

   DEC DB Integrator (DBI) extends the functionality of the DB2 Gateway
   by providing a native integration of DB2 databases with data sources
   accessed by other DB Integrator gateways. DBI clients may directly ac-
   cess and join views of tables existing on multiple databases. These
   views may be horizontally or vertically partitioned and be based on
   tables existing on any database accessible by DB Integrator gateways.
   These DBI views may be pre-defined or dynamically declared.

   DBI servers maintain a persistent catalog of metadata extracted from
   DB2 databases. DBI uses this metadata along with information on net-
   work and underlying database manager capabilities to optimize cross-
   database joins.

   The DB2 Gateway is available on the Digital UNIX[R] Operating System
   on AXP systems, workstations and servers and on the OpenVMS Operat-
   ing System on Digital AXP and VAX systems, workstations and servers.

   for DB2[TM], Version 3.1A

   Standard SQL Interfaces

   The DB2 Gateway provides direct, read/write access to DB2 databases
   through standard DEC SQL interfaces. These interfaces include a dy-
   namic SQL interface, an interactive SQL facility and the SQL/Services
   server.

   SQL data manipulation language (DML) is fully supported. SQL data def-
   inition language (DDL) support is limited to operations required to
   create and maintain tables and indexes and to grant and revoke access
   to database objects.

   The dynamic SQL interface compiles and executes SQL requests passed
   through its call interface. This programming approach is highly ef-
   fective in applications such as ad-hoc query access where the exact
   parameters of requests are not known until runtime. It is compatible
   with any programming language that supports the operating system's call-
   ing standards. The dynamic memory handling capabilities of Ada, C and
   PL/I enable these languages to take full advantage of the power and
   flexibility of this approach.

   The interactive SQL facility supports interactive query and update of
   data and management of table and view metadata in DB2 databases.

   All data format translations are performed automatically as part of
   handling requests to read and update data in DB2 databases. EBCDIC to
   ASCII translation is table driven and may be based on the default ta-
   ble or, where appropriate, on a user-defined table.

   Desktop Connectivity

   The DB2 Gateway includes ODBC drivers for Microsoft Windows and Win-
   dows NT. These drivers enable read/write access to databases via DB2
   servers over DECnet, TCP/IP and Novell[R] NetWare[R] (IPX/SPX) trans-
   ports. Network transport alternatives depend on the selected desktop
   and DB2 Gateway platforms. [1]

     ported only by DB2 Gateways running on OpenVMS VAX platforms

   Distributed Data Access

   The DB2 Gateway supports access from remote clients and to remote DB2
   databases.

   Security

   The DB2 Gateway server works in conjunction with existing security prod-
   ucts, such as CA-ACF2, RACF, and default CICS security, in IBM envi-
   ronments.

   -  DB2 Gateway users require an IBM account and must be properly au-
      thorized within CICS and DB2 to access DB2 data.

   -  DB2 Gateway OpenVMS clients support the CICS attach time security
      option of ATTACHSEC(IDENTIFY). This is the CICS implementation of
      the LU6.2 already verified security option. This option can pro-
      vide a more secure environment by keeping user passwords out of com-
      mand files and off the network. This option requires an external
      security manager (RACF, CA-ACF2) capable of supporting this fea-
      ture within CICS.

   Flexible Access

   The DB2 Gateway client on OpenVMS uses Digital DEC SNA interconnect
   software and hardware, including DEC SNA gateways and the DECnet/SNA
   VMS APPC/LU6.2 programming interface to link VAX to IBM communication
   facilities.

   The DB2 Gateway client for Digital UNIX uses DEC SNA APPC/LU6.2 soft-
   ware to link to remote DB2 Gateway servers running on MVS systems. DEC
   SNA gateways provide the interchange between the protocol used by the
   Digital UNIX system on which the DB2 Gateway is installed and the MVS
   DB2 system. Table 1 lists the capabilities of the current set of SNA
   gateways.

   Both approaches enable DB2 Gateway clients to connect to any DB2 Gate-
   way server that is network accessible.

   Performance

   The DB2 Gateway selects access strategies that minimize data trans-
   fer activity. Wherever possible, selection, filtering, and statisti-
   cal operations are done by the DB2 server. A log of communications ac-
   tivity and errors may be maintained to assist in problem isolation and
   evaluation.

   Optional SQL Compiler Support

   Support for SQL 3GL application development is available with the op-
   tional purchase of a DEC SQL development licenses. DEC SQL develop-
   ment licenses provide precompiler support for embedded SQL applica-
   tions, a compiler for SQL module language programs and an application
   programming interface (API) to support the development of client/server
   applications.

   Embedded SQL programming places SQL language statements in line with
   host language statements. Precompilers replace these SQL statements
   with call statements and object modules. The modified host language
   program is compiled and linked with the object modules to form an ex-
   ecutable image. Precompilers for DEC C, DEC Ada, DEC COBOL, DEC For-
   tran, DEC Pascal and PL/I for OpenVMS are included.

   These precompilers support an optional Federal Information Process-
   ing Standards (FIPS) flagger that allows the user to identify any SQL
   statements which are not in the current ANSI/ISO SQL standard. An ex-
   ception flagger for the Multivendor Integration Architecture (MIA) stan-
   dard is also provided.

   The SQL module language processor allows SQL statements and multistate-
   ment procedures to be grouped into modules. When these modules are com-
   piled, the resulting object modules can be linked with objects cre-
   ated by any language compiler that complies with the OpenVMS calling
   standard. The SQL module language compiler also supports FIPS and MIA
   flagging.

   SQL/Services API programming libraries are used to interface client
   applications to the SQL/Services server. MS-DOS[R] or MS Windows client
   applications can be written in Microsoft C. Macintosh[R] client ap-
   plications can be written in MPW[TM] C or ThinkC.

   A DEC SQL development license also includes SQL/Services client pro-
   gramming libraries for Microsoft Windows[TM], Windows NT[TM], Digi-
   tal UNIX, MS-DOS, Sun[R], ULTRIX or OpenVMS platforms.
