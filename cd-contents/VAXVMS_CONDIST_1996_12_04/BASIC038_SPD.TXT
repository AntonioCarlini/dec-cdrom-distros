PRODUCT NAME:  DEC BASIC for OpenVMS                   SPD 25.36.28

This Software Product Description describes the following two prod-
ucts:

o  DEC BASIC Version 1.2 for OpenVMS Alpha Systems

o  VAX BASIC Version 3.8 for OpenVMS VAX Systems

DESCRIPTION

BASIC is a shareable language processor for the OpenVMS Operating Sys-
tem. It can be invoked as a compiler and the resulting modules can be
linked and run using standard OpenVMS commands. BASIC provides high-
performance for application development by generating inline native
mode instructions. BASIC is also integrated with various programming
productivity tools such as the OpenVMS Symbolic Debugger, DEC Language-
Sensitive Editor (LSE), DEC Source Code Analyzer (SCA) and the Per-
formance and Coverage Analyzer.

BASIC is integrated into the Common Language Environment. This inte-
gration provides BASIC users with:

o  support for OpenVMS interlanguage calling standard

o  access to all OpenVMS system services

o  access to the facilities of the OpenVMS Symbolic Debugger

o  callable interfaces to the OpenVMS Common Run-Time Library

o  support for the Language-Sensitive Editor

                                                      December 1996

      ules.

o  Program segmentation

   -  SUB and FUNCTION subprograms as individually-compiled modules.

      teger (WORD, LONGWORD and quadword), string, segmented string
      keys, packed decimal keys, and descending keys

      DIMENSION, EXTERNAL, FUNCTION, MAP, RECORD and SUB statements.

   -  default data allocation rules can be specified with DCL qual-
      ifiers, BASIC commands, or by the OPTION statement in program
      text.

   -  by default all declarations are implicit, however, the OPTION
      TYPE = EXPLICIT can be used to require explicit declaration of
      all variables.

   -  default constant types can be specified with the OPTION CONSTANT
      TYPE statement.

   -  Integer data type allows:

      *  BYTE (8 bit)
