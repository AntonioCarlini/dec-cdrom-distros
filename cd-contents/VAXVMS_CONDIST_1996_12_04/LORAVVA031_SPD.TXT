   PRODUCT NAME:  DEC DB Integrator Gateway               SPD 32.80.06
                  for ORACLE[R], Version 3.1a

   DESCRIPTION

   DEC DB Integrator Gateway for ORACLE (ORACLE Gateway) provides appli-
   cations and tools with direct, read/write access to ORACLE databases.
   This access can be via interactive or dynamic SQL interfaces. Client
   access is supported by drivers for Microsoft[R] Open Database Connec-
   tivity (ODBC) client applications. Optional support for embedded SQL
   and SQL module language programming is available.

   DEC DB Integrator (DBI) extends the functionality of the ORACLE Gate-
   way by providing a native integration of ORACLE databases with data
   sources accessed by other DB Integrator gateways. DBI clients may di-
   rectly access and join views of tables existing on multiple databases.
   These views may be horizontally or vertically partitioned and be based
   on tables existing on any database accessible by DB Integrator gate-
   ways. These DBI views may be pre-defined or dynamically declared.

   DBI servers maintain a persistent catalog of metadata extracted from
   ORACLE databases. DBI uses this metadata along with information on net-
   work and underlying database manager capabilities to optimize cross-
   database joins.

   The ORACLE Gateway is available on the Digital UNIX[R] Operating Sys-
   tem on AXP systems, workstations and servers and on the OpenVMS Op-
   erating System on Digital AXP and VAX systems, workstations and servers.

   DEC DB Integrator Gateway                             SPD 32.80.06
   for ORACLE[R], Version 3.1a

   The ORACLE Gateway provides direct, read/write access to ORACLE databases
   through standard DEC SQL interfaces. These interfaces include a dy-
   namic SQL interface, an interactive SQL facility and the SQL/Services
   server.

   SQL data manipulation language (DML) is fully supported. SQL data def-
   inition language (DDL) support is limited to operations required to
   create and maintain tables and indexes and to grant and revoke access
   to database objects.

   The dynamic SQL interface compiles and executes SQL requests passed
   through its call interface. This programming approach is highly ef-
   fective in applications such as ad-hoc query access where the exact
   parameters of requests are not known until runtime. It is compatible
   with any programming language that supports the operating system's call-
   ing standards. The dynamic memory handling capabilities of Ada, C and
   PL/I enable these languages to take full advantage of the power and
   flexibility of this approach.

   The interactive SQL facility supports interactive query and update of
   data and management of table and view metadata in ORACLE databases.
   All required data format translations are performed automatically as
   part of handling requests to read and update data in ORACLE databases.

   Desktop Connectivity

   The ORACLE Gateway includes ODBC drivers for Microsoft Windows[TM] and
   Windows NT[TM]. These drivers enable read/write access to ORACLE databases
   over DECnet, TCP/IP and Novell[R] NetWare[R] (IPX/SPX) transports. Net-
   work transport alternatives depend on the selected desktop and ORA-
   CLE Gateway platforms. [1]

   Distributed Data Access

   The ORACLE Gateway supports access from remote clients and to remote
   ORACLE databases.

   ____________________
 [1] ODBC client access via the Novell NetWare (IPX/SPX) transport is sup-

     ported only by ORACLE Gateways running on OpenVMS VAX platforms

   Performance

   The ORACLE Gateway selects access strategies that minimize data trans-
   fer activity. Wherever possible, selection, filtering, and statisti-
   cal operations are managed by the ORACLE RDBMS. A log of communica-
   tions activity and errors may be maintained to assist in problem iso-
   lation and evaluation.

   Disk Space Requirements

   Table 1 lists the disk space required to install and operate the OR-
   ACLE Gateway software by hardware/operating system platform (Platform).
   The common requirement represents the space required to store soft-
   ware objects that are common to DBI and the DB Integrator family of
   gateways. If one of these products is already installed on the sys-
   tem or cluster, the permanent disk space requirement will be decreased
   by this amount.

   system environment, configuration, and software options selected.

   Additional space must be allowed for programs, logs, temporary database
   cache files and user interface software. p>

   NT client applications may require additional software. With the re-
   quired software, all ORACLE gateways support access via DECnet and TCP
   /IP transports. In addition, the ORACLE Gateway on the OpenVMS VAX plat-
   form may be accessed via the Novell NetWare (IPX/SPX) transport.
