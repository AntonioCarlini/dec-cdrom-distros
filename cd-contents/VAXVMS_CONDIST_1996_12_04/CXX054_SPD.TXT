    PRODUCT NAME: DEC C++ Version 5.4 for OpenVMS VAX     SPD 37.39.07
                  DEC C++ Version 5.4 for OpenVMS Alpha

    DESCRIPTION

    DEC C++ for OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha Operating Systems is a na-
    tive programming language product that supports the C++ programming
    language. It includes:

    o  A C++ compiler that implements C++ as defined by The Annotated C++
       Reference Manual, Ellis & Stroustrup, reprinted with corrections
       in May 1991. The compiler implementation includes support for au-
       tomatic instantiation of templates, as well as C++ exception han-
       dling. DEC C++ directly generates optimized object code without em-
       ploying an intermediate translation to C.

    o  A DEC C++ Class Library containing the following packages: iostream,
       complex, generic, Objection, Stopwatch, String, task, Messages, and
       vector.

    o  ANSI/ISO C header files enhanced for use with the DEC C++ compiler.
       These headers are currently packaged with DEC C++ to make them avail-
       able for use with DEC C++. Packaging of the headers is subject to
       change as they become available in sub- sequent releases of related
       products.

    o  An implementation of the Standard Template Library (STL), based on
       the STL developed by Hewlett Packard. The DEC C++ implementation
       has been modified to work with the DEC C++ compiler and enhanced
       to match the September 1995 version of the ANSI C++ draft as closely
       as possible.

                                                             July 1996

 



    DEC C++ Version 5.4 for OpenVMS VAX                  SPD 37.39.07
    DEC C++ Version 5.4 for OpenVMS Alpha

    o  Features to facilitate porting to DEC C++ from other C++ implemen-
       tations. The /STANDARD:CFRONT option relaxes error checking for bet-
       ter compability with C++ compilers based on the AT&T "cfront" trans-
       lator. The /STANDARD:MS option provides better compabibility with
       Microsoft's Visual C++ (TM).

    o  Automatic instantiation of templates

    o  A name demangler that enables other tools (besides the compiler and
       debugger) to present demangled names to the user.

    DEC C++ documentation provides comprehensive reference and usage in-
    formation for all product components. Online help is provided with the
    software, and Bookreader documents are provided on the Layered Prod-
    ucts CD-ROM for the following manuals: Using DEC C++ on OpenVMS Sys-
    tems, DEC C++ Installation Guide for OpenVMS Systems, and the DEC C++
    Class Library Reference Manual.

    Hardcopy documentation is available by ordering the separate software
    documentation kit. The hardcopy documentation also includes a copy of
    an authorative book on C++, the C++ Programming Language, 2nd edition,
    by Bjarne Stroustrup, and a copy of the STL Tutorial and Reference Guide,
    by David R. Musser and Atul Saini.

    Features

    o  Fast compilation and increased code optimization by directly trans-
       lating C++ source programs to OpenVMS VAX and Alpha object files

    o  Extensive global and local optimizations of generated code for in-
       creased performance under OpenVMS

    o  Option for running only the preprocessor phase of compilation

    o  Pragmas to control compiler options

       -  Pragmas to control extern models, sharing of data between con-
          current processes, and structure member alignment

    o  Separate and combined compilation capabilities

    DEC C++ Version 5.4 for OpenVMS Alpha

    o  Compiler generated listing file including optional:

       -  Machine code

       -  Macro expansion

       -  Compilation statistics

    o  Data types for numeric, nonnumeric, and systems programming:

       -  DEC C++ OpenVMS supports 8, 16, 32-bit signed and unsigned in-
          tegers. DEC C++ OpenVMS Alpha also supports 64-bit signed and
          unsigned integers.

       -  DEC C++ supports the following data types: 32 and 64-bit IEEE
          floating point on Alpha

       -  DEC C++ on VAX and Alpha: 32-bit and 64-bit VAX floating-point
          data types. The VAX floating-point formats include D-float and
          G-float and are user selectable.

    o  Integration into the Program Development Environment:

       -  Generation of debug and traceback records for OpenVMS VAX and
          Alpha symbolic debugger support

       -  Conforms to the OpenVMS VAX and Alpha calling standard

       -  Access to the OpenVMS Run-time Library for general purpose rou-
          tines and support of multi-language environments

       -  Access to the data management facilities of OpenVMS RMS (Record
          Management Services)

       -  Ability to package C++ code as shareable libraries

       -  Ability to use additional class libraries. The DEC C++ compiler
          supports logical name search lists in conjunction with the pre-
          processor directive #include.

       -  Support for DEC Language-Sensitive Editor to provide error di-
          agnostics to the Editor

    Run-Time Library for C applications

    DEC C++ Version 5.4 for OpenVMS VAX                  SPD 37.39.07
    DEC C++ Version 5.4 for OpenVMS Alpha

    With the exception of OpenVMS VAX Operating System prior to Version
    6.1, the complete DEC C Run-Time Library that is needed for use with
    DEC C++ is distributed with both OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha Oper-
    ating Systems. The DEC C Run-Time Library provides routines to per-
    form input/output, character and string handling, mathematical com-
    putations, memory allocation, and emulation of selected UNIX[R] fea-
    tures. These routines are provided both in shared image and object mod-
    ule library form.

    DEC C++ Class Library

    With the exception of versions prior to 6.1 of the OpenVMS VAX Oper-
    ating System, the DEC C++ Class-Library Run-Time components are dis-
    tributed with OpenVMS VAX and OpenVMS Alpha Operating Systems. The DEC
    C++ Class Library provides the following packages: iostream, complex,
    generic, objection, stopwatch, string, task, message and vector.

    Run-time Library Redistribution for Older OpenVMS VAX Operating Sys-
    tems

    For OpenVMS VAX Operating V5.5-2 - Version 6.0, the DEC C++ VAX kit
    includes a separately packaged saveset that contains additional or mod-
    ified run-time library components needed to execute programs devel-
    oped with the DEC C++ compiler and class libraries. Revisions to the
    run-time components are shipped with the OpenVMS Operating System rather
    than the DEC C++ compiler, and the components in this special DEC C++
    saveset, or more recent replacements, are included with the OpenVMS
    Operating System for versions 6.1 or later.

    Digital grants you a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide right to
    reproduce and distribute this save-set portion of the DEC C++ kit des-
    ignated as AACRT060.A (the "RTL") provided that you:

    o  distribute the entire RTL save set and copies of its accompanying
       installation documentation;

    o  distribute the RTL only in conjunction with and as part of your soft-
       ware application product which is designed to operate in the Open-
       VMS VAX environment;

    These counts refer to the disk space required on the system disk. The
    sizes are approximate; actual sizes may vary depending on the user's
    system environment, configuration, and software options. The Debug kit
    saveset installation is not used on OpenVMS V6.0 systems, and the Run-
    Time Kit saveset installation uses greatly reduced space on OpenVMS
    V6.0 systems.

    and licensed VAXcluster* configuration. The HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS sec-
    tion of this product's Software Product Description detail any spe-
